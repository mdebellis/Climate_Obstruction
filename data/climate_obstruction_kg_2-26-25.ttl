The subproperties allow the ontologist to do three things:
1) Distinguish start and end times.
2) Indicate whether a time is planned or actual. This is useful for everything from project management to calendar appointments and the like. It is also useful for date effectivities; i.e., something valid up to a planned date).
3) Distinguish varying levels of precision; sort of a simple version of the Allen functions.

All datetimes are of the same format: '2021-06-01T08:03:27.12324-6:00'^^xsd:dateTime. This is compatible with and a subset of ISO 8601.

Time zone offset, such as -6:00 (of which there are a few dozen) is recognized in the date itself, as shown. The actual time zone standard (of which there are 131) may optionally be attached to the event or other object itself.

There will be many historical dates that do not have a time zone offset (e.g., Lincoln's birthday, as well as about 75% of all legacy systems), and in that case the offset can be omitted.

The conventions for precision that are repeated in each property name are as follows:
	- *DateTime is an abstraction over the various precisions of its subproperties.
	- *Date refers to a calendar date (e.g., birthdays and invoice dates) and is assumed to have precision of one day. Time zone offset is allowed.
	- *Minute refers to clock time; e.g., a meeting will start at 9:15 with a timezone offset. Precision is assumed to have precision of one minute.
	- *Microsecond refers to system time, and it will be as precise as the system can supply; typically at least milliseconds, sometime microseconds.""" .

The ASA respond to complaints but we also check ads across media to make sure they’re sticking to the rules. We monitor ads in sectors where there are potential consumer protection issues or where there are societal concerns about specific products, for instance age-restricted products like alcohol, gambling or electronic cigarettes. 

Together with CAP, the ASA works to support the industry to help them get their ads right before they are published. For example by providing guidance, pre-publication advice and training for the industry. Last year, we provided 1 million pieces of advice and training for the industry, most of which was free of charge.

What happens before an ad is published? 
The Advertising Codes require that advertisers hold evidence to prove the claims that they make before they are published or aired. We expect all advertisers to follow the rules when creating their ad campaigns. 

Pre-clearance for TV and radio advertising 
The vast majority of TV and radio ads are pre-cleared before they are broadcast. 

Under their licences broadcasters must take reasonable steps to ensure that the ads they broadcast stick to the UK Code of Broadcast Advertising. 

To help them do this, the broadcasters have established and funded two pre-clearance centres:

Clearcast for television commercials.
Radiocentre for radio ads. 
Non-broadcast advertising
There are many millions of non-broadcast ads published every year in the UK, so it would be impossible to check every one of them before they appear. For example there are more than 30 million press advertisements and 100 million pieces of direct marketing every year. 

However, to help advertisers get their ads right, CAP provides a range of advice, guidance and training, including free pre-publication Copy Advice service. 

We also encourage advertisers and anyone with an interest in the rules or who is involved in producing ads to sign up for Insight and Update, CAP’s advice newsletters here which provide current and timely advice on the latest positions on hundreds of different advertising issues. 

Regulation after an advertisement has appeared 
Even though many steps are taken to ensure ads are in line with the Codes before they are aired or published, consumers have the right to complain about ads they have seen, which they believe to be misleading, harmful or offensive.

The ASA can act on just one complaint. We don’t play a numbers game: our concern is whether the ad rules have been broken. 

Find out more about how we handle complaints

Sanctions
The Advertising Codes and the ASA’s rulings have universal coverage across the advertising industry. Advertisers cannot opt out of them. 

If we have judged an ad has broken the advertising rules, then it must be withdrawn or amended. The vast majority of advertisers stick to the ASA’s rulings and they act quickly to amend or withdraw an ad that breaks the Codes. 

We have a range of sanctions to act against the small number of advertisers who are either unwilling or unable to work within the rules and to ensure they are brought into line. In 2013 Trading Standards took over from the Office of Fair Trading as the ASA’s ‘legal backstop’ on the non-broadcast side.  On the broadcast side, Ofcom acts as our ‘legal backstop’.""" ,
                                                                                 "The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) is the UK’s independent advertising regulator. The ASA makes sure ads across UK media stick to the advertising rules (the Advertising Codes)." .

1. **What it is**  
   - The “CAP Code” refers to the *UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing*.  
   - It is drawn up by the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP).  
   - It covers non-broadcast advertising (e.g., print, online, social media, direct marketing, and promotional marketing).  
   - Although people sometimes assume it is part of UK statutory law, it is in fact a *self-regulatory code*.

2. **Who enforces it**  
   - The UK’s independent advertising regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (**ASA**), administers and enforces the CAP Code.  
   - The ASA is not a government body but is recognized by the government and by the courts as the lead regulator for advertising in the UK. It operates largely as a self-regulatory organization but also works in partnership with bodies that do have statutory powers (e.g., Trading Standards).

---

**How Enforcement Works**

1. **ASA Rulings**  
   - If the ASA finds an advertisement in breach of the CAP Code (for instance, for being misleading, harmful, or offensive), it will issue a formal ruling.  
   - The advertiser must then *amend or withdraw* the offending ad.  
   - The ASA publishes its rulings on its website, which can lead to reputational damage—“naming and shaming” advertisers who break the rules.

2. **Sanctions**  
   - If an advertiser refuses to comply with an ASA ruling, a series of escalating sanctions can follow:  
     - **Ad Alerts**: The ASA can send bulletins to media owners urging them not to run the advertiser’s ads until they comply.  
     - **Pre-vetting/Pre-clearance**: The advertiser may be required to have all future ads checked and approved by the ASA or CAP before publication.  
     - **Referral to Trading Standards**: In serious or persistent cases, the ASA can refer the advertiser to Trading Standards, which *does* have statutory powers (including the ability to levy fines or prosecute if the ad breaks consumer protection laws).

3. **Fines and legal penalties**  
   - The ASA itself *does not usually fine* advertisers (as it is not a statutory body). Its main powers are rulings, instructions not to run certain ads, and reputational/regulatory pressure.  
   - However, if the advertiser persists in breaking the rules or is found to be misleading consumers in a way that violates consumer protection legislation, the matter can be escalated to Trading Standards or other statutory bodies.  
   - In those cases, the advertiser could face formal legal action, including *fines, penalties, or prosecutions*.

---

**Key Takeaways**

- The CAP Code is a *self-regulatory* set of guidelines for non-broadcast advertising in the UK—*not* a piece of primary legislation.  
- The ASA enforces the CAP Code by issuing rulings and imposing various sanctions designed to ensure compliance (such as withdrawing ads, naming and shaming, or pre-clearing future ads).  
- While the ASA does *not* typically issue fines in its own right, it can refer persistent or serious offenders to bodies with *statutory powers* (e.g., Trading Standards), which *can* impose fines or other legal actions.  
- Therefore, although the CAP Code itself is not “the law,” it is underpinned by strong industry commitment and the possibility of legal enforcement if a business repeatedly flouts the Code or breaches consumer protection laws.

It sets out the rules that govern advertising in the UK (excluding TV and radio, which are covered by the BCAP Code). The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) enforces these rules.

Key points about the CAP Code:

Scope: It applies to most forms of non-broadcast marketing communications, including print ads, online ads, social media posts (including influencer marketing), email marketing, and promotional materials.

Aim: The CAP Code is designed to ensure that ads are legal, decent, honest, and truthful. It also sets standards for areas like misleading advertising, harm and offence, children’s advertising, and more.

Enforcement: The ASA investigates complaints from the public and can request that advertisers amend or withdraw advertisements that breach the Code.

In the political and social world it is not uncommon for hypotheses (especially those that go outside what the main stream media considers acceptable topics and points of view) to be dismissed as conspiracy theories which then turn out to be true. E.g., that the US provoked the Gulf of Tonkin incident, that the incident was part of a planned campaign designed to provoke the North Vietnamese into an action that could be used to justify increased US involvement in the Vietnam war was once branded a conspiracy theory, however, the publication of the Pentagon Papers clearly demonstrated that this was indeed the truth. With that caveat in mind our definition is 1) any theory or hypothesis that has no evidence from reliable (non-partisan) sources,2) that contradicts accepted science, or published literature from reliable sources and 3) that furhters a specific political agenda. If a theory meets all 3 criteria it is a Conspiracy Theory" .

The criteria of certification schemes need to demonstrate clear environmental benefits compared with competing products/organizations, should be easily publicly accessible and labels cannot be capable of being confused with other labels, including, for example, labels of publicly run labelling schemes or schemes of competitors.’ (European Commission, 2016). \"All certification schemes shall have a clearly defined scope and also indicate what is not included – to avoid 'scope creep'\" (EDPB, 2021). An important element of transparency and increased accountability and credibility of a certification scheme is the publication of key documents (e.g. standards, inspection guidelines, audit reports) and information related to certification bodies and complaints on the organization's website. These allow stakeholders to evaluate the performance of certificate holders and supply chain actors against the certification scheme’s standards, and to assess how good job the auditors and certification bodies have done.

IT'S GREENWASHING via Dubious Certifications & Labels
Most certification schemes have a dispute or grievance mechanism that enables complaints to be made against certified companies and operations, the conformity assessment bodies (CABs) and the scheme itself. A growing literature provides somewhat mixed evidence regarding the potential for certification to reduce environmental and social impacts (Lambin et al., 2018). Many certification schemes are unable to protect ecosystems' and people’s rights, and thus additional due diligence is required to provide an assurance of responsibly sourced produce. An effective due diligence screening program allows an organization to make an informed decision about whether it is safe to proceed with the certification. Also, many certification and standards systems have a chain of custody model or traceability approach, which is critical for downstream actors to understand who they are sourcing from. However, a Chain of Custody standard might only prescribe handling processes, and not include social abuses or environmental issues that could occur across the supply chain (ISEAL Alliance, 2020). However, often these mechanisms and the cases heard under them are not made public. They may not have clear processes or be easy to use, and complaints may not be addressed in a timely and comprehensive manner. They may also not provide for effective compensation to be paid to those who have been negatively affected. Certifications may also lack a third-party complaint procedure that ensures the process is fair and independent. CABs should not be able to act as both certifier and complainant. Lacking these accountability mechanisms mean the scheme can easily greenwash harmful activities.""" ,

In 2020, the fossil fuel industry spent $10 million on Facebook ads selling “innovative” climate solutions and visions of a “lower-carbon future” (InfluenceMap, 2021). Although challenging to obtain, information about marketing budget may be crucial for assessing potential greenwash. One source could be the annual data available for the biggest companies' ad budgets (Statista, 2024). This indicator also captures those cases, where the marketing budget behind the claim/campaign is much larger when compared to the marketing of other products/initiatives with a higher proportion of the overall business activity (e.g. an energy company is disproportionately spending on communicating 'green' initiatives that make up a small fraction of its business). The most famous example of this form of greenwashing is ExxonMobil's marketing of biofuels made from algae, where the marketing budget was reportedly $100 million, the actual investment was $350 million, and the project itself was cancelled after it became clear that it would never achieve scale (Westervelt, 2023).""" ,

Falsity does not require illegality. This greenwash category is commonly used by organizations to suggest that their preferred solution is also an environmentally responsible one. For example, the fossil fuel industry recently began buying ads that portray natural gas as a green fuel source, when methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, or arguments that decarbonization would make energy unaffordable (Grist, 2021). If there is significant disagreement or doubt over the environmental impacts of certain practices/products/services, the organization should refrain from marketing the message altogether (European Commission, 2021).

Inadequate quantification is a common category of greenwashing. For example, natural capital accounting is a controversial methodology that attempts to put a price on nature and ecosystem. The approach has significant conceptual weaknesses and produces figures irrelevant for demonstrating the actual state of or change within the physical environment (e.g. emission cuts). Likewise, communicating on the wrong metrics, e.g., outcome instead of impact, intensity instead of absolute emissions, or using flattering aggregate figures could also fall into this category. For example, salmon farmed in open ocean pens have significant documented negative environmental impacts, but industry actors may use statistics from research on \"aquaculture\" to make environmental claims about the industry because other types of aquaculture, such as farming shellfish and seaweed, have documented positive environmental effects.""" ,

IT'S GREENWASHING via Inconsistent Organization in Practice.
A growing literature provides mixed evidence regarding the potential for certification to reduce environmental and social impacts (Lambin et al., 2018). Many certification schemes are unable to protect ecosystems' and people’s rights, and thus additional due diligence is required to provide an assurance of responsibly sourced produce. An effective due diligence screening program allows an organization to make an informed decision about whether it is safe to proceed with the certification. Also, many certification and standards systems have a chain of custody model or traceability approach, which is critical for downstream actors to understand who they are sourcing from. However, a Chain of Custody standard might only prescribe handling processes, and not include social abuses or environmental issues that could occur across the supply chain (ISEAL Alliance, 2024). This indicator ensures that when retailers or producers communicate about their (own brand) products being certified they do not merely rely on voluntary certification schemes but ensure that they have a regularly updated effective due diligence policy in place.""" ,

The wording and overall presentation (i.e. layout, choice of colours, images, pictures, sounds, symbols or labels) has to be truthful about the environmental benefit. If green imagery or colours are used, or environmentally friendly footage to promote products or services, this should be treated as separate green claim which should be documented and substantiated. This is a requirement under the Danish Marketing Practices Act and the EU Green Claims Directive. A recent case by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (Innocent Ltd t/a Innocent) (ASA, 2022c) showed that ads are considered misleading when they implied (through imagery and lyrics) that purchasing products was a choice which would have a positive environmental impact when that was not the case.""" ,

While organizations are free to use environmental imagery, the practice can be misleading if it implies that environmentally responsible products or behaviour are a larger portion of their activities than they are or redirects attention away from core business activities that are environmentally damaging. Supran and Hickey (2022) identify disproportionate use of environmental imagery in their analysis of social media communication by fossil fuel, aviation, and car manufacturing companies, with nearly half of posts featuring themes of \"green innovation\" detached from the companies' core offerings.""" ,

This indicator is intended to capture the green marketing of products/services/policies that are presumed to be dangerous or unsafe such tobacco or herbicides. Dangerous could mean containing substances that are toxic, hazardous to the environment, carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR), causing endocrine disruption to human health or the environment, persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic (PBT) without explicitly mentioning this fact when publishing the green claim. If expert studies give rise to significant disagreement or doubt over environmental impacts of certain practices/products/services, the organization should refrain from marketing the message altogether (European Commission, 2021). Highly controversial solutions involve the choice of ecologically counter productive practices that do not maintain or enhance the ecological quality. Having a stake in/supporting fossil fuels (including gas, oils sands, and hydraulic fracking), nuclear energy, agro-fuels from primary crops, utilization of bioenergy as transitional technology, intensive industrial agriculture, sustainable aviation fuels, bottom trawling, etc. are just few examples of such controversial practices.

Although it can be difficult to obtain evidence on lobbying lobbying (in which case 'unknown' could be the answer), there are instances when such activities become exposed. Useful references are the OpenSecrets in the USA<.a>; and the Transparency Register in EU; and Corporate Europe Observatory's website. A further suggested reference for this indicator is InfluenceMap, which provides independent data and analysis on how business and finance are affecting the climate crisis.""" ,

IT'S GREENWASHING via Political Spin.
Critical studies of environmental sustainability initiatives point to the need to evaluate the influence of (industry or other) groups on organizations making green claims. Social network analyses (e.g., Brulle 2019; Farrell 2015; Pattberg 2007) can be used to determine the policy position, funding contributions, or political involvement of think tanks, trade associations or other groups. Affiliation also refers to profiting from, investing in, or collaborating with other organizations. For instance, according to Client Earth's Greenwashing file, Chevron (which makes claims about reducing carbon intensity and investing in renewable and “low-carbon” energies) is a member of a number of trade associations and lobby groups which have sought to block a transition away from fossil fuels (the American Petroleum Institute, the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Legislative Exchange Council). Studies show how these associations have been responsible over recent years for obstructive lobbying practices against urgently needed climate policies and laws, and there are concerns that Chevron—like many other fossil fuel companies—continues to fight climate measures, including behind closed doors.""" ,

Propositions are also often characterized as the type of object that declarative sentences denote. For instance, the sentence \"The sky is blue\" denotes the proposition that the sky is blue. However, crucially, propositions are not themselves linguistic expressions. For instance, the English sentence \"Snow is white\" denotes the same proposition as the German sentence \"Schnee ist weiß\" even though the two sentences are not the same. Similarly, propositions can also be characterized as the objects of belief and other propositional attitudes. For instance if someone believes that the sky is blue, the object of their belief is the proposition that the sky is blue.

If yes...−
IT'S Selective Disclosure GREENWASHING
For assessing this indicator, it is important to understand whether a) the exact scope of action and b) the limitations or system boundaries are transparently communicated. Even if not all stages of life cycle or not all scopes/cumulative impacts can be assessed for the claim, if boundaries are clearly communicated (what is and what is not assessed) and there is a clear pathway of improving the coverage of scope, that is not a greenwash. Likewise, the claimed product/service should not contribute to any significant negative impacts on the environment nor should result in an undue transfer of such impacts (unless the total net environmental benefit has been significantly improved). Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is the most often used tool to assess different environmental aspects, although this approach comes with limitations. When assessing a claim related to environmental impacts, the product/service’s impact over its whole life cycle (on and off-site) is relevant. For the organization's impacts, the GRI Standards could provide an extensive list of specific measures. For products, all production steps including (where applicable) extraction through production, use, and postuse need to be included. An LCA should follow internationally accepted standards (e.g. ISO14000 series (ISO 2006)). Claims lead to greenwashing where they reflect only part of the life cycle/impacts and do not make clear which part they refer to thereby creating a misleading impression about the overall impact on the environment.""" ,

If yes...−
IT'S Selective Disclosure  GREENWASHING
Absolute claims need to be supported by a high level of substantiation. Comparative claims such as “greener” “friendlier” \"more sustainable\" can be justified if the advertised product/organization/service provides environmental benefit over that of the organizations’ previous products/services or competitors’ products/services, and the basis of the comparison is clear. Similarly, if the advertised \"better/greener\" products/services only constitute a minority of the same product/service range within the organization creating the impression that it is the dominant type of product/service, this has to be transparently communicated, otherwise it falls under this category of greenwashing.""" ,

If yes...−
IT'S Selective Disclosure GREENWASHING
Claiming biodiversity or carbon neutrality or a reduction of environmental harm based predominantly on offsetting can mislead people to believe that the claimant is doing more to mitigate environmental harm than they are. For many, overuse of offsetting risks justifying the continuation of business-as-usual practices that damage the environment. Decades of experience with offsets have proven that they are unlikely to provide real long-term gains to balance the certain, often irreversible, destruction resulting from certain business activities. Terms such as “climate neutral” or “climate positive” that rely on offsetting will be banned from the EU by 2026 as part of a new regulations on misleading environmental claims. IUCN, a respected global authority on the state of nature and what is needed to safeguard it, concluded that “…evidence is lacking as to the extent to which no net loss (NNL) / net gains (NG) and offset policies are achieving their goals or contributing to better biodiversity outcomes in the jurisdictions where they exist.” (IUCN, 2014) (NewClimate Institute, 2020). At the same time, well-meaning investments by organizations in environmental protection projects are very much needed and they can be communicated. To this end, NewClimate’s Climate Responsibility approach (NewClimate Institute, 2020) calls for financially supporting others’ climate action, and disclosing that support within company reports, while not using them to “net-out’’ own impacts.""" ,

IT'S GREENWASHING Vagueness
Claims can refer to a part/feature of a product/organization (or simply to the packaging) instead of the whole product/organization creating confusion among consumers about the claim. A typical example maybe a plastic package containing a new product which is labelled “recyclable” without further elaboration. The context of the claim does not make clear if it refers to the plastic package or the product, therefore the claim is deceptive if any part of either the package or the product, other than minor, incidental components, cannot be recycled.""" ,

If yes...−
IT'S GREENWASHING Vagueness
Words such as \"sustainably sourced”, “eco-friendly”, “green”, “sustainable”, “non-toxic”, “biodegradable”, \"natural\", etc are ambiguous terms. The absence of clear definitions for many green marketing terms has made it difficult for consumers to weigh how credible these claims are. Statements such as ‘good for you, good for the planet, good for the future’ also raise as many questions as they answer. Is it good for the planet because of the packaging, because of how the item is produced, because it is healthy for you and the soil or simply because it's less harmful than similar products? Such claims require substantiation, covering the whole lifecycle of the product. Similarly, one cannot just say that plant-based burgers or pet food are better for the planet than a traditional meat burger/meat-based pet food. What ingredients contain the plant-based product, how has it been produced, with what inputs and where was it shipped from? Unless clearly defined and adequately substantiated with easily accessible, independent, verifiable scientific information, such claims remain greenwash.""" ,

If yes...−
IT'S GREENWASHING Vagueness
There is a wide range of terms and claims used by companies in addition to “net zero”, such as \"carbon negative\" or \"climate positive\"; or that they seek to achieve \"net negative\" emissions or \"deep decarbonisation\"; or that they plan to become \"emissions-free\" or achieve \"zero emissions\"; or that they are committed to a \"1.5 degrees C pathway\"; or invest in low-carbon technologies”. \"Most “net zero” targets involve vaguely-written plans with loopholes that allow emissions to continue rising - often for decades after commitments have been taken. The Science Based Targets Initiative (Science Based Targets, 2021) requires that \"companies set targets based on emission reductions through direct action within their own boundaries or their value chains\" and \"offsets are only considered to be an option for companies wanting to contribute to finance additional emission reductions beyond their science-based target/net-zero” (Ibid). Established international best practice guidelines in this area require that organizations/ countries: a) measure, track and regularly publish their emissions according to the latest IPCC or GHG Protocol guidance (e.g. scope 1 and 2 emissions and scope 3 emissions to the furthest extent possible); b) have a clear strategy, implementation planning process and interim targets to reach any future single point targets AND c) develop and publish a long-term strategy with a decarbonisation pathway that prioritizes reducing own emissions.""" ,

Many of the uncovered fossil fuel industry documents include explicit projections of the amount of warming expected to occur over time in response to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Yet, these numerical and graphical data have received little attention. Indeed, no one has systematically reviewed climate modeling projections by any fossil fuel interest. What exactly did oil and gas companies know, and how accurate did their knowledge prove to be? Here, we address these questions by reporting and analyzing all known global warming projections documented by—and in many cases modeled by—Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003.
Our results show that in private and academic circles since the late 1970s and early 1980s, ExxonMobil predicted global warming correctly and skillfully. Using established statistical techniques, we find that 63 to 83% of the climate projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists were accurate in predicting subsequent global warming. ExxonMobil’s average projected warming was 0.20° ± 0.04°C per decade, which is, within uncertainty, the same as that of independent academic and government projections published between 1970 and 2007. The average “skill score” and level of uncertainty of ExxonMobil’s climate models (67 to 75% and ±21%, respectively) were also similar to those of the independent models.
Moreover, we show that ExxonMobil scientists correctly dismissed the possibility of a coming ice age in favor of a “carbon dioxide induced ‘super-interglacial’”; accurately predicted that human-caused global warming would first be detectable in the year 2000 ± 5; and reasonably estimated how much CO2 would lead to dangerous warming.""" ,

Overall, ExxonMobil’s global warming projections closely track subsequent observed temperature increases.
Figure 1Opens in image viewer reproduces all 12 identified unique graphs, which contain 15 of the 16 identified temperature projections (the 16th was reported as a table). For example, panel 3 of Fig. 1Opens in image viewer is a graph showing “an estimate of the average global temperature increase” under the “Exxon 21st Century Study–High Growth scenario” for CO2. It was included in a 1982 internal briefing on the “CO2 ‘Greenhouse’ Effect” prepared by Exxon Research and Engineering Company and circulated widely to Exxon management (36). The briefing was labeled as “proprietary information for authorized company use only.” The graph appeared a second time in an Exxon manager’s presentation on “CO2 greenhouse and climate issues” at an internal company environmental conference in 1984 (37).

Fig. 2. Summary of all global warming projections (nominal scenarios) reported by ExxonMobil scientists in internal documents and peer-reviewed publications (gray lines), superimposed on historically observed temperature change (red).
Solid gray lines (and asterisked numerical labels) indicate global warming projections modeled by ExxonMobil scientists themselves; dashed gray lines indicate projections internally reproduced by ExxonMobil scientists from third-party sources. Shades of gray and numerical labels scale with model start dates, from earliest (1977: lightest, “1”) to latest (2003: darkest, “12”). Numerical labels correspond to panels in Fig. 1Opens in image viewer, which displays all original graphical projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists. Observations reflect the smoothed annual average of five historical time series. For data sources and plotting details, see SM sections S1 and S2.
Panel 3 of Fig. 1Opens in image viewer displays one of 12 unique temperature projections (out of a total of 16 projections) that were output by models built or run in-house by ExxonMobil scientists (the 12 projections are indicated by asterisks in Figs. 1Opens in image viewer to 3Opens in image viewer and Table 1Opens in image viewer). To our knowledge, the temperature projection in panel 3 was independently produced by Exxon scientists as part of “technology forecasting activities in 1981” operated by the company’s Corporate Planning Department (37). The temperature projection was based on “calculations” of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations “recently completed at Exxon Research and Engineering Company” (36). The remaining 11 temperature projections were produced by models developed by ExxonMobil scientists in collaboration with academic coauthors. Specifically, the seven unique temperature projections shown in panels 5 to 7b in Fig. 1Opens in image viewer derived from a one-dimensional upwelling-diffusion Energy Balance Model to study how the “climatic transient response from fossil fuel burning is damped…by heat storage in the world’s oceans…” (38). The Exxon scientist leading the collaboration internally described their climate modeling as “sophisticated” and “state of the art” (39). The remaining four unique temperature projections (three in panels 8, 11, and 12 in Fig. 1Opens in image viewer and the fourth designated by “9” in Fig. 2Opens in image viewer) were generated by an “Integrated Science Model which consists of coupled modules for carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry of other trace gases, radiative forcing by greenhouse gases, energy balance model for global temperature, and a model for sea level response” (40).""" ,

• In 2000, ExxonMobil Corp CEO Lee Raymond wrote that “[W]e do not now have a sufficient scientific understanding of climate change to make reasonable predictions and/or justify drastic measures...the science of climate change is uncertain….” (76). The report speculated about a “natural period of warming,” “solar activity,” and “[v]olcanic eruptions, El Nino.” “With all this natural climate ‘noise’ and the complexities of measurement,” it said, “science is not now able to confirm that fossil fuel use has led to any significant global warming.”
• In 2001, an ExxonMobil Corp press release said of the “Hockey Stick” graph showing anthropogenic global warming: “The error bars are huge, yet some prefer to ignore them” (77).
• In 2005, Lee Raymond said in a television interview: “There is a natural variability that has nothing to do with man...It has to do with sun spots...with the wobble of the Earth...[T]he science is not there to make that determination [as to whether global warming is human-caused]...[T]here are a lot of other scientists that do not agree with [the National Academy and IPCC]...[T]he data is [sic] not compelling” (78).
• In 2007, ExxonMobil Corp’s website stated that “[G]aps in the scientific basis for theoretical climate models and the interplay of significant natural variability make it very difficult to determine objectively the extent to which recent climate changes might be the result of human actions” (79).
• In 2013, ExxonMobil Corp CEO Rex Tillerson said: “[T]he facts remain there are uncertainties around the climate…what the principal drivers of climate change are…[T]here are other elements of the climate system that may obviate this one single variable [of burning fossil fuels]…And so that’s that uncertainty issue…” (80).""" ,

. How Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp cultivated the myth of a 1970s global cooling scientific consensus
• In 1997, Mobil CEO Lee Raymond questioned whether “the Earth [is] really warming” by claiming that “In the 1970s, some of today’s prophets of doom from global warming were predicting the coming of a new ice age” (81).
• In 2001, an ExxonMobil Corp press release said: “[T]here is no consensus about long-term climate trends and what causes them...during the 1970’s [sic], people were concerned about global cooling” (82).
• In 2003, US Senator James Inhofe, who has to date received $2.3 million in campaign contributions from oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, argued that the issue of human-caused global warming “is far from settled” by pointing to “those who warned us in the 1970s that the planet was headed for a catastrophic global cooling” (56, 83–85).
• In 2004, a report published by the ExxonMobil Corp-funded Cato Institute stated that “Thirty years ago there was much scientific discussion among those who believed that humans influenced the…reflectivity [which would] cool the earth, more than…increasing carbon dioxide, causing warming. Back then, the ‘coolers’ had the upper hand…But nature quickly shifted gears…Needless to say, the abrupt shift in the climate caused almost as abrupt a shift in the balance of scientists who predictably followed the temperature” (56, 86).""" ,

Several of the documents in question include explicit projections of the amount of warming that could be expected to occur over time in response to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Yet, whereas the text of these documents has been interrogated in detail, the numerical and graphical data in them have not. Indeed, no one has systematically reported climate modeling projections by any fossil fuel interest, let alone assessed their accuracy and skill. This contrasts with academic climate models, whose performance has been extensively scrutinized (16–24).
In this Review, we report and analyze all known projections of global mean surface temperature (hereafter “temperature”) change reported by company scientists working for Exxon and/or for ExxonMobil Corp after Exxon’s merger with Mobil Oil Corp in 1999. (Hereafter, we collectively refer to Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp as “ExxonMobil” or the “company.”) Some projections resulted from models built or run in-house by ExxonMobil scientists, sometimes in collaboration with independent researchers. Others were produced by third parties and then discussed by ExxonMobil scientists in internal reports. Where relevant, we distinguish these provenances, but otherwise we collectively refer to these projections as “reported” by ExxonMobil scientists.
We test the accuracy and modeling skill of ExxonMobil’s global warming projections by retrospectively comparing them against subsequent observed temperature changes. We also compare their performance against assessments of models published in independent scientific literature. [Here and throughout, we use the term “climate models” to generically refer to computer simulations of Earth’s climate system. All of the models investigated here—both from ExxonMobil and from independent academic and government scientists—are variants of Energy Balance Models, rather than the higher-resolution, more comprehensive General Circulation Models that succeeded them in the late 1980s (25–27).] Having quantified ExxonMobil’s early understanding of climate science, we contrast it with public claims made by the company and its allies. We then offer three illustrations of how quantitative historical analysis of the fossil fuel industry’s documents can yield further historical insights into the disconnect between its private understanding of climate science and its public climate denial.
We focus on global mean surface temperature changes because they are a primary driver of climate impacts, are central to climate policy-making, are the most common output of early climate models, and are accurately captured by observational records. We limit our analysis to global warming projections reported by scientists at ExxonMobil, as compared to other companies, for several reasons. First, ExxonMobil’s extensive climate research program is well documented. Second, ExxonMobil documents contain the largest public collection of global warming projections recorded by a single company, allowing us to develop a coherent picture of the early understanding of climate science by a specific industry actor. Third, the company has been active in challenging climate science in general and climate models specifically, such that its work on the matter may be of particular interest to researchers, reporters, advocates, shareholders, fund managers, politicians, and legal investigators examining corporate responsibility for climate change (Box 1).""" ,

A second insight involves ExxonMobil’s predictions as to when anthropogenic global warming would be discernible against the backdrop of natural climate fluctuations. Ten internal reports and one peer-reviewed publication spanning 1979–1985 offered quantitative estimates, with a median year of 2000 ± 5. (For each document, we infer the predicted year from its corresponding supporting quotations, summarized in table S4; see SM section S1.2.6 for method details.) This is consistent with what in fact occurred. In 1995, the IPCC declared that a human effect on global temperatures had been detected, a conclusion they reiterated with higher confidence in 2000 and in all subsequent IPCC assessment reports (57, 58). In other words, ExxonMobil’s understanding of climate science was sufficient not only to project long-term warming accurately but also to predict when it would be discernible. Yet, ExxonMobil publicly asserted that the science was too uncertain to know when—or if—human-caused global warming might be measurable. In 2004, for example, they stated that “scientific uncertainties continue to limit our ability to make objective, quantitative determinations regarding the human role in recent climate change,” a claim that was contrary to the analysis of their own scientists (59).
Staying silent on stranded assets
A third insight concerns the “carbon budget”—the amount of CO2 that can be added to the atmosphere—while holding anthropogenic global warming below 2°C. Five ExxonMobil studies published between 1982 and 2005 address the question. They conclude that to stabilize CO2 concentrations below 550 ppm and/or limit warming to 2°C would impose a carbon budget of 251 to 716 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC) between 2015 and 2100 (10). For comparison, recent calculations have narrowed the uncertainty and place the figure at 442 to 651 GtC (60). Thus, ExxonMobil’s calculations of the carbon budget were consistent with today’s best estimates. Yet, to our knowledge, ExxonMobil did not alert investors, consumers, or the general public to this constraint.""" ,

ExxonMobil has often specifically claimed or suggested in public that climate models are “unreliable” (51). In 1999, for example, ExxonMobil Corp’s chief executive officer (CEO) Lee Raymond said future climate “projections are based on completely unproven climate models, or, more often, sheer speculation.” (2) In 2013, his successor, Rex Tillerson, called climate models “not competent” (52). In 2015, he stated: “We do not really know what the climate effects of 600 ppm versus 450 ppm will be because the models simply are not that good” (53). The company’s own modeling contradicts such statements. Exxon’s 1982 projection shown in Fig. 1Opens in image viewer (panel 3), for example, suggests that 600 ppm of atmospheric CO2 would lead to 1.3°C more global warming than 450 ppm.""" ,

Researchers and journalists have subsequently unearthed additional documents showing that the US oil and gas industry writ large—by way of its trade association, the American Petroleum Institute—has been aware of potential human-caused global warming since at least the 1950s (3); the coal industry since at least the 1960s (4); electric utilities, Total oil company, and General Motors and Ford motor companies since at least the 1970s (5–8); and Shell oil company since at least the 1980s (9).
This corpus of fossil fuel documents has attracted widespread scholarly, journalistic, political, and legal attention, leading to the conclusion that the fossil fuel industry has known for decades that their products could cause dangerous global warming. In 2017, we used content analysis to demonstrate that Exxon’s internal documents, as well as peer-reviewed studies authored or coauthored by Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists, overwhelmingly acknowledged that global warming is real and human-caused (10). By contrast, we found that the majority of Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp’s public communications promoted doubt on the matter. Cities, counties, and states have accordingly filed dozens of lawsuits variously accusing ExxonMobil Corp and other companies of deceit and responsibility for climate damages (11). The attorney general of Massachusetts, for instance, alleges that ExxonMobil has had a “long-standing internal scientific knowledge of the causes and consequences of climate change” and waged “public deception campaigns” that misrepresented that knowledge (12). Civil society campaigns seeking to hold fossil fuel interests accountable for allegedly misleading shareholders, customers, and the public about climate science have emerged under monikers such as #ExxonKnew, #ShellKnew, and #TotalKnew (13–15) (see Box 1 for more examples).""" ,

(2001), and Kheshgi and Jain (2003)—are large, primarily owing to the substantial impact of interannual and subdecadal variability on short-term temperature trends.
In Fig. 3AOpens in image viewer, we compare trends in temperature change versus time for historical observations (in red) and for all 16 projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists (in gray or black). Over the course of their respective projection periods (indicated in blue boxes at the top of each panel in Fig. 3Opens in image viewer), the average predicted warming was 0.20° ± 0.04°C per decade. Ten of the 16 projections are consistent with historical observations (differences between models and projections are shown in fig. S1A). Of the remaining six projections, two forecast more warming than observed and four forecast less. Treating each unique graph and table—rather than each forcing scenario—as independent, 10 out of the 12 unique projection datasets are consistent with observations. Of the remainder, one forecasts more warming than observed and one forecasts less. Notably, these two projections are among the only three (out of 12) that were reported without uncertainty bars. They therefore have less “room for uncertainty” in our consistency tests. Overall, the models perform very well.
When we account for mismatches between forecast and observed forcings by using the iTCR metric, 12 of the 16 projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists are consistent with observations. Figure 3BOpens in image viewer uses the iTCR metric to compare trends in observed and projected iTCRs, and fig. S1B shows their differences. Treating each unique graph and table as independent, 9 out of 12 datasets are consistent. The three outliers forecast more warming than observed; two of them do not have uncertainty bars.
We also calculate skill scores for the temperature-versus-time and iTCR metrics (Table 1Opens in image viewer). A skill score of 100% indicates perfect agreement between projections and observations; a score between zero and 100% indicates some degree of skill; and a score less than zero indicates a performance worse than a zero-change null hypothesis (16, 20).
With respect to temperature change versus time, we find the average of the median skill scores of all 16 reported projections to be 67 ± 7%. Across projections modeled by ExxonMobil scientists themselves, it is 72 ± 6%. These scores indicate highly skillful predictions. The highest-scoring projection was a 1985 peer-reviewed publication [Hoffert and Flannery (1985, nominal CO2 scenario)], with a skill score of 99% (38). The 1982/1984 projection discussed earlier (Fig. 1Opens in image viewer, panel 3) has a skill score of 82% [although it marginally failed the consistency test (Fig. 3Opens in image viewer and fig. S1)]. Only three of the 16 projections have skill scores below 50%. For comparison, NASA scientist James Hansen’s global warming predictions presented to the US Congress in 1988 have been found to have skill scores ranging from 38 to 66% across the three different forcing scenarios that he reported (16, 20).
Using the iTCR metric, the average skill of the 16 projections is 67 ± 9%. Among projections modeled by ExxonMobil scientists themselves, it is 75 ± 5%. Seven projections score 85% or above. Hoffert and Flannery (1985, high CO2 scenario) is again the highest scorer (92%), closely followed by two projections scoring 90%, which are featured in three internal reports in 1982/1984 and 1985, respectively (38, 39, 41, 42). Only four projections have skill scores below 50% for the iTCR metric. Again, for comparison, Hansen’s 1988 projections had skill scores in terms of the iTCR metric ranging from 28 to 81% (16).
We can compare these metrics with Hausfather et al. (2020), who calculated the average skill scores of 18 academic and government climate model projections published between 1970 and 2007. They obtained a value of 69% for both temperature-versus-time and iTCR metrics (16). On average, therefore, global warming projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists were as skillful as those of independent scientists of their day, and their own models were especially skillful. (As described earlier, ExxonMobil scientists did not simply rerun existing models; they developed their own models, typically in collaboration with academic coauthors, which independently corroborated the findings of other climate scientists.) To the extent that these projections represented contemporary knowledge of the likely effects of fossil fuel burning on global temperature, we can conclude that Exxon knew as much in the 1970–1990s as academic and government scientists knew. The average warming projected by the 18 academic and government models was 0.19° ± 0.03°C per decade, which is, within uncertainty, the same as ExxonMobil’s average of 0.20° ± 0.04°C per decade.
We note that 2 of the 18 projections analyzed by Hausfather et al. (2020) are among those reported by ExxonMobil scientists. However, excluding these two projections has negligible effect on the average warming predicted by ExxonMobil or on the average skill scores of all ExxonMobil projections with respect to both temperature change versus time and iTCR (see sensitivity analyses, SM section S1.2.5 and table S1). Our conclusions also hold true when considering only the 12 (of 16) temperature projections from models built or run in-house by ExxonMobil scientists, indicated by asterisks in Figs. 1Opens in image viewer to 3Opens in image viewer and Table 1Opens in image viewer (see SM section S1.2.5 and table S1).
In summary, climate projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists between 1977 and 2003 were accurate and skillful in predicting subsequent global warming. Some projections suggested slightly too much warming and others not quite enough, but most (63 to 83%, depending on the metric used) were statistically consistent with subsequently observed temperatures, particularly after accounting for discrepancies between projected and observed changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. ExxonMobil’s projections were also consistent with, and as skillful as, those of academic and government scientists. All told, ExxonMobil was aware of contemporary climate science, contributed to that science, and predicted future global warming correctly. These findings corroborate and add quantitative precision to assertions by scholars, journalists, lawyers, politicians, and others that ExxonMobil accurately foresaw the threat of human-caused global warming, both prior and parallel to orchestrating lobbying and propaganda campaigns to delay climate action (1, 2, 10, 11, 13, 43–48), and refute claims by ExxonMobil Corp and its defenders that these assertions are incorrect (49).""" ,

We analyzed 32 internal documents produced in-house by ExxonMobil scientists and managers between 1977 and 2002, and 72 peer-reviewed scientific publications authored or coauthored by ExxonMobil scientists between 1982 and 2014. The internal documents were collated from public archives provided by ExxonMobil Corp (28), InsideClimate News (29), and Climate Investigations Center (30). The peer-reviewed publications were obtained by identifying all peer-reviewed documents among ExxonMobil Corp’s lists of “Contributed Publications,” except for three articles discovered independently during our research (31) [see supplementary materials (SM) section S2 for details on the assembly of the corpus]. These constitute all publicly available internal ExxonMobil documents concerning anthropogenic global warming of which we are aware, and all ExxonMobil peer-reviewed publications concerning global warming disclosed by the company.
Using manual content analysis, we identify all documents that reported climate model outputs of (i) a time series of projected future temperature, and (ii) future external radiative forcings [including at least atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration] (see SM section S1.1 for coding details). For models driven by more than one forcing time series (i.e., for high- and low-CO2 scenarios as well as a central, “nominal” one), each resulting temperature time series is treated as a separate and individual projection. Our figures and tables therefore distinguish between “nominal,” “high,” and “low” model projections. By contrast, for a given CO2 scenario, temperature time series accompanied by uncertainty bars (corresponding, for example, to different model climate sensitivities) are treated as single projections with uncertainty bounds given by those uncertainty bars. This yields 12 documents published between 1977 and 2003, which contain 16 distinct temperature projections presented in the form of 12 unique graphs and one table (summarized in SM section S2.2). The 12 documents comprise seven internal memos (1977 to 1985) and five peer-reviewed papers (1985 to 2003). Twelve of the 16 temperature projections came from models built or run in-house by ExxonMobil scientists, typically in collaboration with independent researchers. Once identified, all original temperature and forcing projections are converted for analysis by digitizing graphs and extracting tables.""" ,

Our findings demonstrate that ExxonMobil didn’t just know “something” about global warming decades ago—they knew as much as academic and government scientists knew. But whereas those scientists worked to communicate what they knew, ExxonMobil worked to deny it—including overemphasizing uncertainties, denigrating climate models, mythologizing global cooling, feigning ignorance about the discernibility of human-caused warming, and staying silent about the possibility of stranded fossil fuel assets in a carbon-constrained world.""" ,

Mythologizing global cooling
Panel 1b of Fig. 1Opens in image viewer is a graph of the global warming “effect of CO2 on an interglacial scale” originally published by climate scientist J. Murray Mitchell Jr. in March 1977 and reproduced by Exxon scientist James Black in a private briefing to the Exxon Corporation Management Committee 4 months later (54, 55). This dataset was not included in our preceding analysis because its long time scale does not permit accurate digitization of its projected post-industrial anthropogenic global warming. Nonetheless, overlaying the original graph with the temperatures simulated by a modern Earth system model (in red) shows that Exxon scientists were accurate in warning their superiors of the prospect of a “carbon dioxide induced ‘super-interglacial,’” as Mitchell Jr. termed it, that would render Earth hotter than at any time in at least 150,000 years (56). This shows that Exxon scientists correctly sided with the majority of the peer-reviewed literature in the 1970s that foresaw human-caused global warming overwhelming any possibility of global cooling and a (natural) ice age. [According to Peterson et al. (2008), only ~14% of the peer-reviewed literature between 1965 and 1977 anticipated global cooling (56).] It also shows that “the myth of the 1970s global cooling scientific consensus” cultivated in public by Mobil in the 1990s and ExxonMobil Corp in the 2000s (see Box 3) was false and contradicted the conclusion of their own scientists that global cooling was unlikely (56).""" ,

The substantial body of literature documenting the history of climate lobbying and propaganda by fossil fuel interests has been described as a “vast blind spot” of major climate assessments—ignored, in particular, in all but the most recent IPCC assessment report (61–63). Yet bringing quantitative techniques from the physical sciences to bear on a discipline traditionally dominated by qualitative journalistic and historical approaches offers one path to remedying this blind spot. Here, it has enabled us to conclude with precision that, decades ago, ExxonMobil understood as much about climate change as did academic and government scientists. Our analysis shows that, in private and academic circles since the late 1970s and early 1980s, ExxonMobil scientists (i) accurately projected and skillfully modeled global warming due to fossil fuel burning; (ii) correctly dismissed the possibility of a coming ice age; (iii) accurately predicted when human-caused global warming would first be detected; and (iv) reasonably estimated how much CO2 would lead to dangerous warming.

BACKGROUND
In 2015, investigative journalists discovered internal company memos indicating that Exxon oil company has known since the late 1970s that its fossil fuel products could lead to global warming with “dramatic environmental effects before the year 2050.” Additional documents then emerged showing that the US oil and gas industry’s largest trade association had likewise known since at least the 1950s, as had the coal industry since at least the 1960s, and electric utilities, Total oil company, and GM and Ford motor companies since at least the 1970s. Scholars and journalists have analyzed the texts contained in these documents, providing qualitative accounts of fossil fuel interests’ knowledge of climate science and its implications. In 2017, for instance, we demonstrated that Exxon’s internal documents, as well as peer-reviewed studies published by Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists, overwhelmingly acknowledged that climate change is real and human-caused. By contrast, the majority of Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp’s public communications promoted doubt on the matter.""" ,

First, we overlay all original temperature time series with observed temperature changes. Observations are aligned with respect to the earliest reference year(s) for which model projection data are available and, unless noted otherwise, reflect the smoothed annual average of five historical time series. Following Hausfather et al. (2020) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we compare observations to model projections in two quantitative ways: (i) change in temperature versus time; and (ii) change in temperature versus change in radiative forcing (the “implied transient climate response,” or iTCR) (16, 24). The iTCR metric enables us to assess model performance while accounting for any differences in the assumptions about future radiative forcings driving the models. For each projected and observed temperature time series, per-decade temperature changes are calculated by fitting an ordinary least squares model over the projection period and multiplying the resulting gradient coefficient by 10. Analogously, iTCR is calculated by regressing temperature against anthropogenic radiative forcing over the projection period and multiplying the result by the forcing associated with doubled atmospheric CO2 concentrations,

In the real world, of course, global temperature changes are driven by multiple natural and anthropogenic factors, including but not limited to CO2. Nevertheless, even when model projections are driven by CO2-only anthropogenic forcing scenarios, retrospectively comparing projections to observations offers a robust, independent, and established test of model skill. This is because (i) global warming has been almost entirely human-caused since the late 19th century (32, 33) and (ii) total anthropogenic forcing over the past 150 years has been, to first order, similar to the forcing of CO2 alone, because the warming effects of other greenhouse gases and the cooling effects of other sources cancel one another out (34).

 values, meanwhile, were based on a 1000-member ensemble of observationally informed forcing estimates reported by Dessler and Forster (2018) (35).
Evaluated in terms of each of the above metrics, we deem model projections and historical observations to be consistent if and only if the 95% confidence intervals of the differences between the two include zero. As detailed in SM sections S1.2.2 and S1.2.3, these confidence intervals were calculated to reflect two sources of uncertainty: (i) statistical uncertainty in regression coefficients and (ii) structural uncertainty due to different model climate sensitivities, as and when indicated by error bars in projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists.
As an additional measure of performance, we calculate the “skill score” of each model by comparing the root-mean-squared errors of a model projection with those of a zero temperature change null hypothesis (20). For each projection, we calculate skill scores with respect to (i) each of the five observational temperature records for the temperature-versus-time metric and (ii) the 5000 estimates of

Emphasizing uncertainties
It has been established that, for many years, Exxon’s public affairs strategy was—as a 1988 internal memo put it—to “emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions regarding the potential enhanced greenhouse effect” (10, 44, 50). However, our analysis shows that in their reports and briefings to management, ExxonMobil’s own scientists did not particularly emphasize uncertainty; on the contrary, the level of uncertainty indicated by their global warming projections (bootstrapped 2σ standard error of the mean = ±21%) was commensurate with that reported by independent academics (±16%). Crucially, it excluded the possibility of no anthropogenic global warming; at no point did company scientists suggest that human-caused global warming would not occur. Nor did they conclude that the uncertainties were too great to permit differentiation of human and natural drivers. Yet publicly, ExxonMobil Corp made these claims until at least the early 2010s (see Box 2).""" ;

                                                                                                                                         """Implications
The 10 university-industry agreements reviewed for this report reveal a considerable amount about the goals and expectations of the big energy companies as well as the research conditions and constraints that academic researchers at U.S. universities are now operating under as a condition of their acceptance of this private industry financing.

Our review found that the terms and conditions outlined in these 10 agreements do not always show parity between the two sets of research partners. Indeed, the report’s analysis supports the author’s view that, in fundamental respects, the vast majority of these contracts seriously challenge the historic research integrity and the independence of the universities involved.

In the recent past, private industry (through Bell Labs and numerous other corporate research hubs) conducted a substantial amount of scientific research and technological development. Over the past 30 years, however, many private companies have vastly reduced their R&D investments, and downsized or outright eliminated their own inhouse scientific and technological expertise. What research these companies do continue to fund is increasingly contracted out to third parties, including private contract research labs and U.S. universities. This is not true of all firms, of course, but it is certainly true of most of the large, established energy companies, as this report demonstrates.

On campus, meanwhile, the research climate is also rapidly changing. Thirty years ago, large-scale, multi-year strategic corporate research alliances on campus were far less common, and overt academic commercialism was largely taboo. Today the boundary between academic research and commercial research is far more blurry. So far, the long-term consequences of this subtle but important shift in the nation’s science-and-technology infrastructure have not been well explored. This shift is especially important to consider in the energy sector, where independent university scientists and experts are urgently needed to measure and interpret today’s complex global-warming problems, uncover path-breaking new technologies, and provide impartial advice and expertise to the public and government agencies regarding effective public policy.

Because this independent university sector remains so vitally important, the Obama administration, Congress, federal agencies, and university leaders across the country would do well to carefully consider the findings of this report, which point to several intriguing new conclusions regarding the efficacy of developing new sources of alternative energy through joint university-industry research partnerships.

First of all, the manner in which these industry contracts were negotiated and concluded points to numerous potential challenges for future U.S. university negotiators. Many of these agreements fail to make any clear distinctions between independent, academic research and commercial research for hire. If more U.S. universities begin to work with the energy industry through these types of contract-research arrangements then it will be far more difficult for them to continue producing credible, independent energy research in these critical academic fields. One has only to review the extensive science literature on pharmaceutical industry influence and conflicts of interest in academic medicine to see the potential hazards that can arise from tearing down the boundary walls that separate academic and commercial research.

Second, preserving an independent research sector inside top-ranked U.S. universities remains vitally important for the advancement of clean energy research and the health of the U.S. science and innovation system more broadly. U.S. universities have traditionally performed many types of research (curiosity-driven science, fundamental inquiry, disinterested research) that private firms were unable, or unwilling, to finance adequately on their own, because of shorter-term commercial, strategic, and profit considerations. Many of this nation’s most path-breaking scientific discoveries—including those that launched the biotechnology, computing, and information-technology revolutions—were born out of publicly financed research, performed in academic labs.

Of course, private industry has also made enormous contributions to U.S. science and innovation. But until recently, most major firms operated their own independent, commercial R&D labs. It remains highly uncertain what will happen to our nation’s unique academic sector if private industry continues to move its R&D operations onto U.S. campuses without showing adequate respect for the university’s highly distinctive academic research culture.

Third, we need to preserve a research sphere that is committed to public-good research— research that has enormous social value, but which rarely generates commercial profits. In the area of energy research alone, this might include studies comparing the relative social, economic, energy, and environmental consequences of various competing alternativeenergy technologies, or advanced research to measure carbon and other greenhouse gases emitted from various sources, or the development of effective carbon caps, taxes, trading, and measuring systems. Without this type of public-good research—carried out independently of specific commercial- or special-interest groups—it is far more difficult for political leaders and the public to develop effective, enlightened public policies.

Finally, public-private partnerships will certainly be necessary for bringing new cleanenergy research and technologies into the commercial marketplace, whether they originate in academic labs, government labs, or commercial labs. But these partnerships should not be pursued in a manner that compromises the long-term health of this nation’s public research sphere. When U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Energy, issue public-private R&D grants, they should clearly differentiate between the research objectives of American universities and the objectives of the individual private-sector partners. This can be done by crafting standard legal agreements between the federal funding agencies, U.S. universities, and private firms that vigorously protect the universities’ core academic- and public-knowledge missions, including their commitment to self-governance, free inquiry, and research independence. Commercial firms should be required to accept these terms in exchange for government research support.

In the final section of the main report, we offer recommendations for avoiding what we see as the problems with the contracts at these 10 universities, through our “detailed contract reviews” featured in this report’s appendices. The purpose: so the problems will not be repeated at other universities. The goal of these recommendations is to ensure that corporations seeking to partner with U.S. universities to capitalize on academic expertise and resources are not granted excessive commercial influence over the academic research process and, in some instances, overly broad commercial advantages as well. We briefly detail these recommendations here.""" ,

Nevertheless, the industry’s decision to shift more of its already limited R&D spending to U.S. universities is highly significant, and could have far-reaching consequences for the future direction of energy R&D efforts nationally. In large part, this is because the U.S. government commitment to energy R&D has remained persistently low for decades, so every dollar of private industry funding that comes into university labs is urgently needed. Consider that:

From 1993 to 2006, U.S. government spending on all energy-related R&D (in real dollars) remained stuck at roughly $3 billion to $4 billion per year, averaging $3.6 billion per year over this period. This is 60 percent less than the $9 billion the U.S. government spent on energy R&D in 1979. (see graph)

Over the same years, by contrast, real federal spending on defense R&D and health R&D averaged $58 billion and $22 billion per year, respectively. (see graph)

Industry financing of university research is certainly legitimate. Academic-industry research collaborations have led to critical advancements in science and engineering and should be nurtured. Yet industry funding can also have a powerful distorting influence on the quality, topics, and credibility of academic research when it is not properly managed.

Indeed, in recent years a large body of analytic and empirical research has shown that industry-funded studies in sectors ranging from pharmaceuticals to tobacco to food are associated with reported outcomes that strongly favor the corporate sponsor’s products and/or interests compared to studies funded by government and non-profit sources.""" ,
                                                                                                                                         """It’s clear that Big Oil and other large energy companies have ramped up their advertising budgets to project a pro-environmental business orientation. But if we crack open the industry’s annual reports, it is also clear that today’s climate and energy crises (and persistently high oil prices) haven’t had anywhere near the impact on energy industry R&D spending that the earlier oil price shocks of the 1970s once had. After rising sharply in the 1970s, energy industry spending (adjusted for inflation) on all types of R&D has plummeted, from an annual average of nearly $6.4 billion in the early 1980s to an annual average of roughly $1.7 billion at the start of the last decade (see graph).

The annual reports of four of the largest oil companies— ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, and Chevron— between 2000 and 2007 (before the Great Recession began) do show some overall gains in R&D spending. But these R&D gains, which are overwhelmingly directed toward enhanced oil and gas recovery, not clean energy, remain truly marginal, particularly in light of the oil industry’s vast profit margins in recent years. In constant 2006 dollars, here’s what these company reports reveal:

ExxonMobil’s total R&D spending has remained essentially flat since 1993, with barely any increase.
Shell had the fastest growth in R&D expenditures over the past five years (out of the four companies); however, because Shell’s R&D outlays had dropped dramatically throughout the 1990s, actual gains were marginal.
BP continues to spend less on energy R&D than either ExxonMobil or Shell. Despite dubbing itself BP or “Beyond Petroleum” in 2000, BP’s aggregate spending on all energy R&D is still roughly the same as it was a decade ago, although the company’s pledge of $50 million per year over 10 years for the Energy Biosciences Institute will lift this total slightly.
Chevron’s aggregate spending on R&D remained extremely low and flat from 1999 through 2004. Since 2005, Chevron’s R&D outlays rose, but they still remain the lowest of the four. (see the graph for details).""" ,

This report’s analysis of the contracts underlying 10 large-scale university-industry alliances to finance energy research identifies eight major areas where serious limitations on academic freedom and academic research, and governing independence are permitted. What follows is a brief description of the eight areas where these agreements appear to fail to uphold the universities’ core academic and public-interest obligations:

1. Do these agreements protect university independence and academic self-governance?
In nine of the 10 agreements, the university partners failed to retain majority academic control over the central governing body charged with directing the university-industryresearch alliance. Four of the 10 alliances allow for full industry sponsor control over the alliance’s main governing body.

In some cases the written agreement explicitly gives the industry sponsor or sponsors full control. In other cases, this is how the agreement is being interpreted and/or administered in practice. This finding is quite remarkable. “Academic independence” has been rooted, historically, in the university’s core belief that it must retain the ability to govern its own internal affairs. This is often referred to as “academic self-governance” or “academic autonomy.”

Ever since the birth of the academic freedom movement in the early 1900s, U.S. universities and their faculties have worked strenuously to prevent outside donors (whether a wealthy benefactor, a commercial sponsor, or a federal grant-making agency) from exerting undue influence over faculty teaching, research, and other internal academic governance decisions. The rationale for this is quite straightforward: Without self-governance, research independence and free inquiry are meaningless.

2. Do these agreements require faculty research proposals to be evaluated and awarded funding on the basis of impartial “peer review”?
None of the 10 agreements requires faculty research proposals to be evaluated and awarded funding in each new grant cycle using academic methods of independent, impartial peer review. In the case of the Arizona State University-BP research alliance this question does not apply because all the research projects have been identified upfront so no other campus faculty are eligible to apply for funding.

In interviews and written comments, several university officials told CAP that, even though their formal alliance agreements do not require peer review, they do frequently draw on the expertise of outside expert reviewers. Yet, in all the cases reviewed in this report, it is the view of the author and our legal experts that the use of peer review is variable, inconsistent, and/or does not rise to the level of genuine, impartial, expert peer review. And because peer review is not secured in the alliance’s legal contract, its weight in the research-selection process remains unclear, and its application can be altered or simply abandoned at any time. (For more discussion, please see the detailed contract reviews in Appendices 1-10.)

Consider Stanford University’s Global Climate and Energy Project, which is funded by Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Toyota and Schlumberger. Neither of GCEP’s formal written alliance agreements (originally signed in 2002 and renewed in 2008) requires the use of expert peer review for the selection of faculty research proposals. Both agreements’ use of peer review is entirely optional and left to the discretion of the four industry sponsors. Stanford officials respond that GCEP uses an informal peer-review system even though it is not legally required, and that they posted written peer-review protocols on a public website to clarify how this peer review works in practice. But our outside legal experts say this informal peer review system is not legally binding and could be altered or abandoned at any time. (see Appendix 8 for details)

Academic peer review has long been considered the gold standard when it comes to appropriately and fairly evaluating the quality and worthiness of scientific and academic research. When faculty research proposals are evaluated by independent experts using an impartial peer review process, it helps to ensure that corporate-research funding is awarded on the basis of both scientific and academic merit—not merely on the basis of one firm’s short-term business needs or the narrow strategic goals of one industrial sector.

When Cornell University’s faculty senate issued final recommendations in 2005 on how best to structure large-scale, university-industry research alliances, it strongly emphasized the centrality of independent peer review: “The important point—vital to honoring the principal that we are engaged in academic, not corporate research—is that genuine, disinterested peer review occur.”

3. Are these agreements fully transparent about how the faculty may apply for commercial funding, and what the methods and criteria for selection will be?
Eight of the 10 alliance agreements fail to specify in adequate detail how faculty may apply for alliance research funding, or what evaluation and selection criteria will be used. Within the university and scientific communities it is widely understood that high standards cannot be maintained unless faculty research and scholarship is judged fairly and impartially based on academic merit and scientific excellence, not according to the narrow wishes or dictates of outside sponsors.

The notable lack of clarity and transparency in a majority of these 10 university-industry agreements (combined with their failure to require peer review) suggests that funding awarded through these academic-industry alliances will strongly favor the business and strategic interests of the corporate sponsors. Given that nine of the 10 agreements also clearly state that the university side will be responsible for administering and overseeing the research-selection process (on behalf of the alliance as a whole), this could leave university leaders vulnerable to accusations that they are putting the sponsors’ commercial interests ahead of the universities’ core commitment to high-quality research, and the disinterested quest for knowledge and truth for the benefit of the public.

4. Do these agreements adequately distinguish “academic research” from “corporate research for hire?”
The answer to this question largely rests on which party to the agreement defines the alliance’s overarching research agenda, which party draws up the “request for faculty research proposals” in each new grant cycle, and which party retains majority control over the evaluation and final selection of academic research proposals. Let’s consider each of these in turn.

In eight of the 10 agreements that we reviewed, the industry sponsor substantially defines the alliance’s “overarching research agenda.” (The exceptions were Arizona State University and Stanford University.) This is not unusual. No funding source is entirely neutral. Simply by defining what research questions will be asked, nearly every sponsor exerts some degree of influence over the academic research enterprise.

It also is not unusual for the corporate sponsors to play a subsequent role in setting the research agenda during each new grant cycle. In five of the 10 agreements, the industry sponsors and the university partners share some responsibility for drawing up a list of research topics in each new grant cycle, and issuing the request for new faculty research proposals. In four cases, the contact allows the industry sponsors to fully set the agenda in each new grant cycle.

But in eight out of 10 contracts we examined, the agreements broke significantly from longstanding university commitments to academic self-governance. This finding is the most significant one. Usually, when it comes to internal academic governance decisions—including the evaluation and selection of faculty research—the university insists on majority academic representation and the right to use independent, expert peer reviewers. In 2007, for example, a U.C. Berkeley faculty senate committee reviewing the Energy Biosciences Institute partnership stressed that all BP-EBI funded research “should not in any way be conceived of or seen as work made for hire for the benefit of the corporate sponsor.”

Nonetheless, in eight of the 10 alliance agreements reviewed here, the university failed to retain majority control over the evaluation and final selection of faculty research proposals, or to require the use of impartial peer review, thus leaving the distinction between “academic research” and “corporate research for hire” quite unclear and uncertain.

5. Is the university’s fundamental right to publish protected?
Yes. Nine of the 10 agreements affirm the university’s right to publish, but in many instances this contractural right is curtailed by potentially lengthy corporate delays. The National Institutes of Health generally recommends no more than a 60-day delay on academic research publication, which it deems adequate time for the corporate sponsor to file a provisional patent application and remove any sensitive proprietary information. None of the 10 agreements analyzed abide by this maximum-60-day federally recommended publication delay; most far exceed it.

One alliance agreement at the University of Colorado, Boulder and three other publicly funded research institutions in Colorado (known as the Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels, or C2B2) permits the industry sponsors to delay publication for up to 210 days. Another alliance agreement at Stanford University, the Global Climate and Energy Project, gives the four sponsors a mandatory, 60-day review period to consider patent protection prior to release of any academic publications. After this, the agreement provides for no maximum delay on publications, leaving the potential, at least, for indefinite delays. A third alliance agreement with Chevron permits the sponsor to delay publication for up to one year, including student theses.

The timely release of academic information is what makes the university research sphere so exceptionally vibrant, innovative, and dynamic. Rapid dissemination of new knowledge helps to insure that all scientific research is subject to independent review and replication to verify its accuracy. Research should never be quarantined; it needs to be released rapidly so others can react to it and build upon it, continually driving the pursuit of new knowledge forward.

6. Does the corporate sponsor enjoy monopoly commercial rights to all the university’s sponsored-research results?
We asked our outside legal examiners to rank each alliance agreement on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing very weak contract language granting exclusive commercial rights to the industry sponsor, and 10 representing very strong language granting exclusive commercial rights. Seven of the 10 agreements ranked 8 or higher for their degree of exclusivity, thus giving the industry sponsors strong monopoly commercial control over the alliances’ sponsored research results.

Seven of the 10 agreements left the university side with extremely limited power to license sponsored-research results nonexclusively to outside commercial users. But there are three notable exceptions. The first is the so-called “shared side” of the Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels. The second is the alliance agreement between the University of Texas at Austin, Rice University, and ten companies. And the third is Stanford University’s Global Climate and Energy Project agreement. GCEP was originally launched in 2002, but the university and its four industry sponsors negotiated a new, revised contract in September 2008 that greatly facilitated non-exclusive licensing and open academic sharing of GCEP research results through the elimination of a 5-year, sponsor exclusivity provision. (see Appendix 8 for details)

But the flip side is this: At least four of the 10 agreements (BP-Arizona State University, BP-Energy Biosciences Institute, Chevron-U.C. Davis, and Chevron-Texas A&M) explicitly permit the industry sponsors to extend the commercial rights to “background” academic research, which by definition was not funded by the industry sponsors but by public and other sources not party to the alliance agreement.

Because U.S. taxpayers continue to subsidize higher education substantially through general overhead for state universities, federal and state subsidies for student tuition, graduate-student fellowships, educational tax breaks, and federal research grants, most U.S. universities pledge their commitment to patenting and licensing academic research in a manner “consistent with the public interest.” This is generally understood to mean that universities will work to maximize broad public use of their academic inventions and research tools, and prevent any one private or commercial entity from exerting excessive monopoly control, unless it is absolutely necessary to promote commercial development.

Case in point: In one 2008 review of the BP-EBI alliance, a faculty senate Task Force on University-Industry Partnerships noted that “the use of exclusive licenses should be as limited as possible, given our public mission.” Such sentiments have also been affirmed by the National Institutes of Health, and by more than 50 universities that are signatories to a 2007 statement titled “Nine Points to Consider in University Licensing.”

Yet in seven of the 10 contracts we examined for this report, industry sponsors are granted broad, upfront, exclusive commercial rights to alliance research—even, in some cases, when certain “background knowledge” was developed prior to the creation of the alliance and not funded by the sponsor.

7. Are university faculty members free to share their sponsored-research results with other academic investigators?
Using our 1-to-10 scale, with 1 representing very weak protections for academic use and sharing and 10 representing very strong protections, the 10 agreements earned an average ranking of just 5.5 for protecting academic use and sharing. Given how important academic sharing is to the whole university and national scientific enterprise, this is troubling.

Since 2007, more than 50 U.S. research universities have endorsed a public statement listing nine core principles that all universities should be required to uphold in their licensing deals with industry. The first of these principles calls for all universities to include a provision in their industry contracts—often known as a “research exemption” —that permits professors and students to freely share their sponsored-research results (including data, tools, and methods) with outside researchers for non-commercial research purposes, including verification of published research findings.

Nevertheless, only four of the 10 alliance agreements had strong academic-use and sharing provisions, receiving a rank of 7 or higher. Five of the 10 agreements ranked 5 or lower (moderate to poor) for protecting the academic investigators’ right to share sponsoredresearch with other academic scientists and scholars for purely research and non-commercial purposes, despite its centrality to the academic research enterprise.

8. Are conflicts of interest adequately regulated in these university-industry alliance agreements?
Nine of the 10 agreements fail to discuss the management of financial conflicts of interest related to the alliance and its research functions. The lone exception is Stanford University’s Global Climate and Energy Project, where the agreement mentions the need to manage conflicts of interest only with regard to optional peer review panels (convened at the discretion of the industry sponsors) and third-party university grant recipients. This latter reference, however, was dropped from GCEP’s, revised 2008 agreement.

None of the 10 agreements prohibit members who sit on the alliances’ main governing body from having personal financial interests related to the research they are charged with overseeing and directing. At the BP-Arizona State University alliance there is no formal governing body so this question does not apply.

Similarly, none of the 10 agreements prohibits committee members charged with evaluating and selecting faculty research proposals from having financial conflicts of interest related to the research they are reviewing. Again, the lone exception is Stanford’s Global Climate and Energy Project, where the agreement states that peer review panels must be free of conflicts, but these panels are optional, and used solely at the discretion of the management committee members, where the industry sponsors control all the votes.

Furthermore, none of the 10 agreements specifies that these committee members may not award commercial research funding to themselves, or their own labs. This type of potential conflict has already surfaced as a widespread problem at the BP-funded Energy Biosciences Institute administered by U.C. Berkeley. Specifically, after the EBI deal was finalized at the end of 2007, U.C. Berkeley’s press office announced that the executive committee charged with evaluating faculty research projects for possible BP funding would have strong majority academic representation. And when the first formal executive committee convened in 2008 it had eight members, seven of whom were academics and one of whom was a representative from BP. But when this report’s author probed a bit deeper, she soon found that seven of these eight committee members had significant potential conflicts of interest, including all but one of the academics.

Two of the eight executive committee members, including the EBI’s Academic Director and the lone BP representative, had financial ties to firms that could stand to profit from the EBI’s academic research. And five of the other committee members had a different potential conflict: All were listed on the EBI website, in the spring of 2008, as “primary investigators” on research projects funded by BP-EBI. What this strongly suggests is that all five could award BP research grant money to themselves and their labs. At the very least, the application and receipt of BP-EBI funding calls into question whether these faculty members were capable of fairly and impartially evaluating other faculty research proposals.

More recently, these potential conflicts of interest on the EBI’s executive committee seem to have only worsened. As of September 2010, the EBI listed a total of 13 executive committee members: 11 academics and two representatives from BP. Yet 10 of these academics are also listed as primary EBI investigators or heads of projects supported with BP-EBI funding, and one, EBI Director Chris Somerville, continues to have personal financial interests in an outside firm partnering with BP on research that is similar to that of EBI. That means three of the executive committee’s 13 members have financial ties to firms that could profit from EBI research, and the other 10 are academic researchers who have vested research and financial interests with the EBI that could compromise their ability to evaluate incoming faculty research in an impartial and disinterested manner, based on scientific merit (for more details, see the box on conflicts of interest on page 64).""" ,

To better understand the specific contractual requirements underlying each of these university-industry research alliances, we turned to Professor Sean O’Connor, a noted legal scholar at the University of Washington Law School with expertise in intellectual property law and university-industry contracting, and Jeremiah Miller, his former graduate assistant and now a practicing attorney in Seattle. O’Connor is Director of the Law, Technology and Arts Group at the University of Washington School of Law. He provides private legaland IP-consulting assistance to many universities, nonprofits and for-profit organizations. Miller performed the primary analysis and interpretation of the contracts. O’Connor then reviewed his analysis. Their services were provided in a personal capacity. They do not necessarily endorse the conclusions of this report.

All the “academic benchmarks” used in our review of the 10 agreements were drawn from a set of detailed analyses of Strategic Corporate Alliances, or SCAs, on campus, developed by a prominent faculty-senate committee at Cornell University from 2004 to 2005.35 Most of the 10 agreements reviewed here broadly fit Cornell’s definition of a Strategic Corporate Alliance: “a comprehensive, formally managed company-university agreement centered around a major, multiyear, financial commitment involving research, programmatic interactions, intellectual property licensing, and other services.”36 Academic norms and public-interest commitments are not well codified in any single document, but they are frequently referred to and affirmed in university mission statements, faculty senate documents such as Cornell’s SCA review, and statements and reports issued by government funding agencies and prominent university associations, including the Association of American Universities, Association of American Medical Colleges, and American Association of University Professors.

This report’s author used the Cornell SCA analyses and their SCA management recommendations as the basis for developing a list of 17 Review Questions to structure this report’s legal contract review. As such, the legal review is not from a purely business standpoint (since most legal contracts are assumed to involve two business entities) but rather from the standpoint of widely accepted academic norms and public-interest benchmarks, including the need to safeguard the university’s core academic mission, and its commitment to self-governance, independent research, and the dissemination of high-quality, reliable, public knowledge.

With regard to the intellectual property provisions in these agreements, our outside legal experts were asked to rank each agreement on a scale of 1 to 10 to assess the amount of exclusive commercial control over academic research results that each agreement permits the industry sponsors, as well as the degree of flexibility afforded to the university partners (and faculty) to license discoveries nonexclusively and/or to share research with other academics. Knowledge sharing is widely seen as a fundamental duty of all academics, as detailed in “Nine Points to Consider in Licensing University Technology,” a 2007 statement signed by more than 50 universities, and other federal agency guidelines.37 It should be noted that our external legal reviewers’ scored rankings for several of the Contract Review Questions are necessarily subjective because interpretations of law and other intellectual property terms cannot be strictly quantified. Moreover, to the author’s knowledge, these contracts have not been tested in a court of law, so their “legal meaning” has not been definitively elaborated.

The first round of legal reviews were completed in the summer of 2008. In July 2010, CAP invited the universities heading up these 10 alliances to provide written comments on the major contract findings, and any contract updates. Seven of the 10 universities provided feedback, two did not respond to our request, and one, Texas A&M University, requested permission from the state attorney general to deny our request for information relating to its Chevron alliance. To the best of our knowledge, the contract analyses in Appendices 1-10 beginning on page 75 are current.

Many university administrators, in their comments and interviews, raised objections to this report’s reliance on written contracts, noting the existence of other academic customs, campus-wide policies, and procedures and practices developed outside of the written contracts. Many of these administrators also objected to the report’s predominant focus on academic and public-interest benchmarks to rate the contracts, arguing there also is an academic and public interest in drawing private-sector money and expertise into the research and development of alternative energy technologies. They felt this view was not sufficiently addressed in the analysis of their contracts as presented in our major contract findings at the time of their review. These comments from university administrators are presented in the individual appendices beginning on page 75 and are taken into account when germane in the appendices and the main body of the report.

Still, these legal agreements constitute the primary, if not the only, legally binding authority between the parties. Anything that is left up to informal practices and generalized policy is subject to alteration and inconsistent application, and may not be legally binding. Written contacts also enhance accountability, and engender public trust. Thus the focus of this report on the contracts themselves as the basis of the report’s analysis.""" ,

The reasons: A sizable portion of this university funding is now being directed to “alternative energy research” (especially biofuels), and this shift in the allocation of industry resources has the potential to significantly influence the academic research culture in this new energy arena.

These investments in clean energy research by leading energy companies also appear to be part of the energy industry’s current campaign to project a more pro-environmental public image. Turn on the TV or open virtually any magazine and you’re likely to see an ad from a major oil, coal, gas, auto, agriculture, or other company touting its commitment to the research and development of clean-energy technologies: biofuels, “clean coal” technology, hydrogen fuel cells. Not infrequently, these “green ads” explicitly reference the industry’s multimillion-dollar alliances with U.S. universities, whose prestige and public trust are an added selling point (see box).""" ,

Launch an “Apollo Project” for clean-energy, climate, and efficiency R&D with strong academic and public-interest safeguards
In 2009, for the first time in several decades, the U.S. Congress significantly boosted energy R&D spending. When both stimulus money and appropriations funding are included, the 2009 Department of Energy budget for R&D bounced 68 percent (over 2008 funding levels) to $16.3 billion, with the largest portions going to Basic Science ($6.1 billion) and Energy R&D ($6.4 billion), and the remainder ($3.8 billion) going to DOE defense-related research. Of this, roughly $3.95 billion is slated for Energy Efficiency and Renewables R&D specifically. Such investments must continue. It is time for the U.S. government to launch a major new initiative to finance cutting-edge research in clean energy and energy efficiency at U.S. universities on the scale of past federal science programs, such as the Apollo and Manhattan projects.

Before the U.S. government invests in additional R&D, however, it should develop “standard contract language” attached to every federal research grant for universities that obligates the university to uphold certain core academic and public interest obligations—no matter whether this funding comes via the federal government alone, or in combination with corporate matching grants.

Require all federal energy grants be issued using expert peer review
Renewed U.S. investment in energy-related R&D should be accompanied by a standard federal contract that requires use of impartial expert peer review by all federal, university, and private industry research partners. Allocating federal science funding through an independent, scientific peer-review process is the only way to ensure that taxpayer grants are awarded on the basis of true scientific merit. Use of independent expert peer-review should also be stipulated in all academic-industry-government R&D alliance agreements.

Allocate sufficient funds for fundamental, pre-commercial science and other vital public-good research
The federal government likes the idea of using public-private partnerships to maximize the economic impact of public science spending. And certainly using government R&D funding to leverage (and also stimulate) industry R&D spending can be a “win-win” combination. But public-good research should involve more than the pursuit of technologies with the potential for near-term commercialization. As transportation expert John DeCicco at the University of Michigan explains: “Ultimately, public-good research needs to be directed toward achieving critical public-good outcomes such as lowering global greenhouse gas emissions in the near term, not just the development of new technologies.” Academic expertise is urgently needed to tackle a broad array of public interest problems, and also to advance public knowledge and understanding.""" ,

This report also offers recommendations on how to sustain America’s vibrant public research infrastructure, and our universities’ commitment to high-quality, disinterested, public-good energy research. Here, we briefly summarize these recommendations.

Police commercial conflicts of interests
U.S. universities must not allow their quest for research revenue or, increasingly, their quest for earnings from the transfer and commercialization of academic research, to distort their core academic and public-knowledge functions. Industry relationships and other commercial activities on campus should not compromise the universities’ fundamental commitment to the pursuit of truth, impartial inquiry, and public-good knowledge.

This is not to say that U.S. universities and their faculties should disregard the potential commercial applications of their academic research and discoveries. Not at all. But universities need to make a far more vigorous effort to oversee and, whenever possible, eliminate financial conflicts of interest on campus (both at the faculty and at the institutional levels) to preserve their scientific and academic integrity, research independence, and public trust. This process, too, could be vastly aided by stronger federal conflict-ofinterest guidelines attached to federal research grants.

Maximize faculty involvement in the design and oversight of large-scale corporate-research alliances
University faculty, through their main governing body—the academic or faculty senate—should be fully involved in the planning, execution, and monitoring of any large-scale, academic-industry research alliances proposed on campus. These large, multi-year corporate-research alliances tend to have a broad impact on the whole academic institution, due to their size, duration, and potential influence on the public perception of the institution compared to more common, smaller industry-sponsored research agreements. As such, they warrant far greater faculty-senate involvement in their initial design, formation, and subsequent oversight. This will also engender greater campus support and public trust through enhanced transparency.

Safeguard academic autonomy
To protect the American university’s valuable traditions of self-governance and research independence, academic representatives (not industry representatives) should retain strong (preferably two-thirds) majority representation and voting power on any academic governance bodies that are charged with overseeing or administering university-industry research alliances on campus. Equal distribution of voting power is not sufficient, because it does not protect the university’s tradition of self-governance and research autonomy.

Retain academic control over research selection and the use of independent expert peer review
University representatives should retain majority representation (and voting power) on any academic body that is charged with evaluating faculty research proposals, and/or making final research awards, as part of any large-scale, multiyear, university-industry research alliance. Faculty research proposals should also always be evaluated using independent expert peer review so research excellence, not merely narrow commercial preferences or profit criteria, guide the academic selection process. And experts selected to judge faculty research proposals should never be in a position to derive any financial benefit from the alliance (or its corporate sponsors). They should remain free of personal financial interests that could in any way bias or prejudice their evaluations.

Minimize delays on publication
U.S. universities should not permit their industry sponsors to delay publication for longer than 60 days, which the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies deem sufficient time for the commercial sponsor to file for provisional patent protection and remove any sensitive corporate proprietary information. Publication is an academic principle that helps ensure the rapid diffusion of public knowledge, which is independently scrutinized and verified for accuracy.

Protect academic knowledge sharing
Any university that enters into a large-scale industrial research alliance should include a legal clause—known as a “research exemption” or “academic-use exemption”—as part of its licensing agreement with the corporate sponsor. This “exemption” permits all university professors to freely share their sponsored-project results (related to any published academic research) with other scientists, both within their own academic institution and at other non-profit and governmental institutions, for purely non-commercial, research purposes. Too many schools continue to overlook this critical knowledge-sharing function even though it is the first principle enshrined in a 2007 academic statement titled “In the Public Interest: Nine Points to Consider in Licensing University Technology,” endorsed by more than 50 universities.

Resist monopoly ownership of academic knowledge
Researchers rely on the wellspring of shared academic knowledge to stimulate their own creativity, research, and scientific and technological discovery. Over the past several decades, in an effort to extract rents from campus-based research, U.S. universities have imposed proprietary restrictions on a growing share of this academic research. Because U.S. universities remain heavily reliant on U.S. taxpayer support for their research-anddevelopment funding, it is important for these academic institutions to resist the temptation to grant their corporate sponsors exclusive, monopolistic control over the universities’ academic research, most of which is heavily subsidized by public sources. To the greatest extent possible, U.S. universities should license the bulk of their research nonexclusively so it may be used by multiple parties in diverse research and commercial applications.

Together, these sets of recommendations to the federal government and universities would help both private industry and the American public by preserving a vibrant, highquality, public research sector. The analysis of these 10 university-industry research contracts alongside our observations and recommendations can help the Obama administration and Congress as they consider new measures, such as national limits on carbon pollution, a Clean Energy Technology Fund, and other programs to stimulate sustainable energy and clean energy technologies. By ensuring that the balance in these collaborative research efforts tilts strongly in favor of academic independence, the administration and Congress have a rare opportunity to restore this vital balance between our public and private research sectors. Our energy security, global environment, and economic competitiveness all hang in the balance.""" ,

To unpack these questions and help find answers, this report provides a detailed examination of 10 university-industry agreements that together total $833 million in confirmed corporate funding (over 10 years) for energy research funding on campus. Copies of these contractual agreements were obtained largely through state-level public record act requests (see the table on pages 13 and 14 for a list of these 10 agreements, and see page 15 for the methodology used for obtaining and analyzing them). Each agreement spells out the precise legal terms, conditions, and intellectualproperty provisions that govern how this sponsored research is carried out by the faculty and students on campus. (See methodology on page 15 for a discussion of how practices that are not required in these conflicts fit into the analysis.)

Independent, outside legal experts then performed a detailed analysis of each agreement. These experts’ detailed contract reviews may be found in Appendices 1 through 10 beginning on page 75 of this report, and include responses from a number of the universities that entered into these agreements. It should be noted that our external reviewers’ rankings for several of the “Contract Review Questions” are subjective because interpretations of law and other intellectual property terms cannot be strictly quantified. Also, the provisions in these contracts have not to our knowledge been tested in a court of law, so their “legal” meaning has not been definitively established.

The results of this report’s analysis of these 10 large-scale university-industry contracts raise troubling questions about the ability of U.S. universities to adequately safeguard their core academic and public-interest functions when negotiating research contracts with large corporate funders. This report identifies eight major areas where these contracts leave the door open to serious limitations on academic freedom and research independence. Here are just a few brief highlights:""" ,
                                                                                                                                         """The world’s largest oil companies are showing surprising interest in financing alternative energy research at U.S. universities. Over the past decade, five of the world’s top 10 oil companies—ExxonMobil Corp., Chevron Corp., BP PLC, Royal Dutch Shell Group, and ConocoPhillips Co.—and other large traditional energy companies with a direct commercial stake in future energy markets have forged dozens of multi-year, multi-million-dollar alliances with top U.S. universities and scientists to carry out energy-related research. Much of this funding by “Big Oil” is being used for research into new sources of alternative energy and renewable energy, mostly biofuels.

Why are highly profitable oil and other large corporations increasingly turning to U.S. universities to perform their commercial research and development instead of conducting this work in-house? Why, in turn, are U.S. universities opening their doors to Big Oil? And when they do, how well are U.S. universities balancing the needs of their commercial sponsors with their own academic missions and public-interest obligations, given their heavy reliance on government research funding and other forms of taxpayer support?""" ,
                                                                                                                                         """To our knowledge, this report represents the first time independent analysts have systematically examined a set of written university-industry agreements within a specific research area—in this case, the energy R&D sector—to evaluate how well they balance the goals of the corporate sponsors to produce commercial research that advances business profits with the missions of American universities to perform high-quality, disinterested academic research that advances public knowledge for the betterment of society.

Before Congress releases billions of dollars in much-needed federal funding for more research and development of alternative and renewable energy and energy efficiency via direct grants and other public-private partnerships, it should give careful consideration to the findings and recommendations made in this report. Indeed, this analysis could not be more timely. As proposals to put a cap and price on carbon pollution circulated earlier this in Congress, most major oil companies, including their main lobby, the American Petroleum Institute, continue to vigorously oppose any such carbon caps by running millions of dollars’ worth of negative ads warning the public and politicians of the dire consequences of action. But whenever comprehensive energy legislation is finally implemented, then a significant portion of the funds generated through cap-and-trade legislation will likely be targeted toward efficiency and clean-energy R&D performed by academic experts at U.S. universities.

What’s more, these funds will likely be disbursed through a variety of public-private research partnerships similar to the ones examined in this report. In recent years the U.S. Department of Energy and other federal agencies have shown a strong preference for disbursing federal research dollars through public-private cost-sharing arrangements. According to Doug Hooker, the director of renewable energy at the DOE’s Golden Field Office in Colorado (which handles grant making for DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy), roughly 80 percent to 90 percent of the federal research money that now goes to finance renewable-energy and efficiency R&D is disbursed through some form of public-private cost-sharing arrangement.

Usually, says Hooker, the corporate beneficiary of this DOE research funding is asked to provide a 20 percent to 50 percent matching grant, depending on the stage of the research project and its proximity to commercial application. “We are leveraging the available dollars that are out there in the private sector,” Hooker said in an interview. “We believe it helps with the success rate and the industry’s commitment to these technologies.”

Yet the long-term effectiveness of this strategy remains unknown. John DeCicco, an expert on transportation and a senior lecturer in the School of Natural Resources and the Environment at the University of Michigan, remains skeptical. “The whole concept of using tax dollars in public-private arrangements needs much better scrutiny,” he argues. “This strategy inherently threatens the essence of public-good research, and can blur the boundary lines between independent invention and analysis on the one hand, and strictly commercial R&D on the other.”

U.S. universities, of course, have long relied on a combination of federal government and industry grants to finance their research operations. U.S. academic institutions spent $52 billion on research and development in 2008, the last year for which complete data were available, with about 60 percent financed by U.S. taxpayers through a variety of federal grant-making agencies. Nationally, though, only about 6 percent of university research overall is funded by industry.

Nevertheless, according to some estimates, because of the federal government’s growing preference for allocating federal R&D funds through corporate matching grants and other cost-sharing and cooperative-research arrangements, private industry now directly influences anywhere from 20 percent to 25 percent of university research funding overall. In this way, a significant share of U.S. taxpayer funding that starts out as “public” funding is effectively turned “private” by the time it reaches the university investigators in their academic labs.

Top Obama administration officials, including Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Undersecretary for Science at the Department of Energy Steven E. Koonin, are strong supporters of using industry-university-government partnerships to advance clean-energy R&D. In 2007, prior to joining the administration, both Chu and Koonin were instrumental in brokering a $500 million research collaboration (discussed in detail in this report) between the British oil giant BP PLC and three major U.S. taxpayer-financed research institutions: the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a federal research lab managed by U.C. Berkeley. At the time, Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, was director of Lawrence Berkeley, and Koonin was serving as BP’s chief scientist.

By academic standards, these multiyear, multimillion-dollar industry investments on campus certainly look huge. Yet relative to the oil industry’s vast profit margins, this R&D spending remains infinitesimally small. Consider BP’s 10-year, $500 million investment in the Energy Biosciences Institute at U.C. Berkeley, which is primarily dedicated to researching biofuels. Relative to BP’s profit margins, this mega-size university deal represents little more than a drop in the proverbial bucket. Let’s begin by conservatively estimating that BP’s average business performance from 2006 to 2015 will remain roughly on a par with its 2003-2007 performance. During this time period, BP’s average revenues were $233 billion, and its average profits hit $19.2 billion. If such trends continue, and excluding any significant hit to BP’s bottom line due to the consequences of the 2010 oil catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico, then:""" ,

Now let’s turn to the centerpiece of this report: the university-industry-research agreements themselves. The central analysis that underpins this report, and the questions it raises, is drawn from a comprehensive analysis and independent expert level review of 10 recent alliance agreements among as many as 43 companies (some contracts boast fluctuating membership), 13 leading universities, and two federal research labs, totaling $833 million in confirmed industry funding over ten years.

Most of the copies of the 10 agreements were obtained through public record act requests filed with state-funded universities (although these often proved extremely time-consuming and difficult to obtain because many state-funded institutions stalled or outright refused our requests). Several were also obtained from academic administrators through personal phone requests, or had been previously made public. Private universities are not required to (and usually do not) publicly disclose their contract research agreements with industry. Stanford University made a rare exception when it chose to publicly disclose its contract with ExxonMobil and three other companies following campus pressure to do so (see table below for a complete list of the 10 agreements analyzed and the accompanying box on page 15 for an explanation of the methodology we employed).""" ;

Despite widespread public backing for the UK’s legally binding goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and the economic benefits it could bring, climate obstructionists deploy a variety of tactics and strategies to maintain dependence on volatile and dangerous fossil fuels.

Key actors:
Organised sceptic groups and think tanks (e.g. Global Warming Policy Foundation, Net Zero Watch), media (particularly right-leaning papers such as The Daily Telegraph and The Daily Mail), business and trade associations (e.g. CBI), government actors and institutions.

Tactics:
Media campaigns: Outlets such as The Daily Telegraph often publish editorials and opinion pieces promoting climate obstructionism.
Lobbying and political influence: Fossil fuel companies directly lobby elected politicians to shape policy in their favour and fend off tighter regulation. This influence is enabled by donations to political parties and revolving doors and secondments to government.
Key messages:
Economic cost: Framing climate policies as ‘a risk to the economy’, ignoring the more significant financial costs to the public resulting from slow progress on climate action.
Undermine renewables: Climate obstructionists cast doubt on the reliability and cost of renewable sources like solar and wind power, despite evidence that in the UK renewables are significantly cheaper than gas.""" ;

Laois. An Bord Pleanála (the national planning authority) rejected permission for the wind farm, citing visual impacts and local development plan designations for wind turbines. Under the local Laois County Development Plan, wind farms would not be constructed in the relevant area based on the alleged visual concerns. Still, as the national planning authority, An Bord Pleanála could grant permission for the wind farm regardless of any alleged material contravention of the County Development Plan. In this instance, however, the planning permission was refused in line with the visual concerns outlined in the original County Development Plan.

The company sought to appeal the decision before the High Court, arguing inter alia that under S15(1) of the Climate Act, as well as in line with EU law and obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, the planning authority had an obligation to interpret its planning decisions such that climate considerations would take priority over the visual concerns and that the authority had therefore taken inadequate account of S15(1) of the Climate Act. The planning authority argued in response that a narrow interpretation of this provision was appropriate, obliging the authority only to give regard to climate considerations and that the authority had, therefore, acted within its powers in refusing permission for the wind farm.

The High Court, in a ruling by Humphreys J. upheld the appeal, finding that An Bord Pleanála had acted unlawfully by failing to exercise its powers in a manner compliant as far as practicable with the climate objectives and policies set out in the Climate Act, and had also breached its duties under EU law and European human rights law. The Court noted that \"if climate goals take precedence over visual impacts [as had been found in a previous case of Nagle View Turbine Aware Group v. An Bord Pleanála [2024] IEHC 603 (Unreported, High Court, 1st November 2024)] and the like, then logically they must take precedence over development plan provisions that are motivated by visual impacts.” 

The High Court further noted that the recent European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) decision in KlimaSeniorinnen v. Switzerland demonstrated that the requirement to read legislation in an ECHR-compliant manner supported an interpretation of S15 that went beyond the board’s approach and that the interpretation should ensure that ECHR obligations are complied with in practice, including compliance in practice with stated goals in relation to renewable energy infrastructure. The failure to properly consider the climate benefits of allowing the project, therefore, constituted a breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Taking the importance of climate action into account, the Court held that the authority had not adequately considered S15(1) in its considerations of whether to grant permission in light of the need to consider climate objectives in contrast to the visual impacts and local planning concerns expressed by those opposed to the wind farms. It stated that \"the need for an imperative reading of S15(1) in line with what it says, namely that the board and any other relevant body is required to act in conformity with the climate plans and objectives set out in the subsection unless it is impracticable to do so.\" [117]

The Court, therefore, granted the appeal and ordered that the application be remitted to An Bord Pleanála for further consideration in accordance with the judgment.""" ;

Editorial
Steep falls in emissions have been the pandemic’s immediate effect. But what’s needed is a green recovery

So far, discussions of a coronavirus exit strategy have mainly focused on the steps that could bring an end to the lockdown. In the short term, both in the UK and elsewhere, there is nothing more desirable than letting people resume their lives, once it is safe to do so.

But the speed of the “return to normal” is not the only thing that matters. The manner in which the world’s leaders manage the colossal economic and political shocks caused by the virus is also of the utmost importance. And at the top of their list of priorities, alongside human welfare, must be the biosphere and its future.

It’s too soon to say with any confidence what impact coronavirus will have on the climate emergency. The brakes placed on economic activities of many kinds, worldwide, have led to carbon emission cuts that would previously have been unthinkable: 18% in China between February and March; between 40% and 60% over recent weeks in Europe. Habits and behaviours once regarded as sacrosanct have been turned on their heads: road traffic in the UK has fallen by 70%. Global air traffic has halved. Meanwhile, a much-needed spotlight has been thrown on humans’ troubling relationship to wildlife, with some experts arguing that the degradation of the natural world and exploitation of other species is among the pandemic’s causes.

In human terms, the economic contraction precipitated by the virus – and predicted by the World Bank to lead to a severe depression – is sure to be brutal. No one, and least of all an elected government, would have chosen to limit emissions in this way. But if further savage waves of destruction to people’s livelihoods are to be avoided, rather than simply stored up or ignored until they become unignorable, just as coronavirus was, every possible effort must now be made to ensure that the recovery, when it comes, is as green as possible; that any and every stimulus package is directed towards renewable energy and zero- or low-carbon infrastructure and transport.

The urgency and desperation surrounding all such efforts are likely to militate against progressive measures. Already, governments are coming under huge pressure to bail out oil and gas companies (in the US and Canada this has already begun). But while in the short term the low oil price, which is also the result of a price war being waged by Saudi Arabia and Russia, could have the damaging effect of making oil more competitive against renewables, plunging demand and turmoil in the industry provide an opportunity that must be seized by all who oppose the continued dominance of fossil fuels.""" ;

Specifically, the complaint alleges that Pasubio is sourcing leather from cattle ranching firms that operate within the forests inhabited by the Ayoreo Totobiegosode in the Gran Chaco area of Paraguay. The Ayoreo Totobiegosode are the only indigenous people living in voluntary isolation in the Americas outside the Amazon rainforest. According to the applicant, the activities of the cattle farms contribute to the deforestation of the Ayoreo lands and the violation of their human rights. Although climate change is not the main issue at the centre of the case, the specific instance explicitly addresses the link between deforestation activity and the climate emergency (p 49).

Not only are they a source of protein and iron but they also make their own natural fertiliser, which all plants need to grow. So, by mixing half chickpeas with half the chicken in your curry, your dish will be better for you and better for the planet. Chickpeas. Small but powerful.

The TV ad, seen on 14 October 2021, opened with a voice-over which stated, “People of earth, if trying to eat better feels too hard, try your half-est.” The ad showed meals being cooked while the voice-over continued, “We’ll mix half lentils into half mince, half chickpeas will meet half chicken and half beans will meet half beef.

It also stated that comparative claims could be justified if the advertised product provided a total environmental benefit over that of a competitor product. The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the claim “by mixing half chickpeas with half the chicken in your curry” in ad (a) and “try your half-est”,and “We’ll mix half lentils into half mince, half chickpeas will meet half chicken and half beans will meet half beef” in ad (b), that the ads were advocating a reduction in meat portions with examples of substitutions for plant protein equivalents. We considered the claims “your dish will be better for you and better for the planet” and “we’ll help our health and planet” would be understood to mean that reducing meat consumption in our diets was better for the environment, based on the environmental impact associated with the meat industry compared with the production of plant proteins. We acknowledged that the chickpeas, beans and lentils featured in the ad would likely have been grown abroad and imported into the UK. However, we did not consider that the ad was comparing domestically produced meat with imported legumes. Ad (b) featured the claim “Research shows eating in line with UK dietary guidelines will be better for the planet than the current average UK diet”. We considered that made clear that the ad was focusing on a change in diet, shifting from meat-based to more plants, rather than a comparison of domestic and imported produce. It was making a general claim regarding the overall accepted premise that a plant-based diet was, in general terms, better for the environment. We noted that the ad did not feature or promote any particular product range but only showed the ingredients, which could be purchased at many retailers, being added to the meals that were being prepared. We also considered that the assumption that domestically produced foods were always better for the environment was not always the case. There were a number of factors, in addition to location, such as the methods used to grow certain foods and how they were transported which affected their environmental impact and we understood that in some scenarios foods which were grown abroad and imported had lower carbon emissions than the same foodstuff produced domestically. Ad (a) stated regarding chickpeas, “Not only are they a source of protein and iron but they also make their own natural fertiliser, which all plants need to grow”. We considered the claim highlighted a benefit of how chickpeas grew, namely that by producing their own nitrogen they did not require additional nitrogen fertiliser which contributed to soil health and fertility, as well as helping the growth of future crops. Sainsbury’s provided a link on their website from the URL featured in both ads to a study entitled “Improving Soil Health and Human Protein Nutrition by Pulses-Based Cropping Systems”, which supported that incorporating pulses in farming and cropping systems was important to enhancing soil and human health especially in continents where chemical fertilisers were used. We considered the claim was focusing on one aspect of the chickpea’s life cycle and highlighting a specific reason why reducing the portion size of chicken in a meal and substituting that for chickpeas would be better for the environment. Both ads featured the URL sainsburys.co.uk/helping-everyone-eat-better which took consumers to a page with further information on the “Helping everyone eat better” campaign. The page outlined the Eatwell Guide which was the UK Government’s dietary recommendations and provided further links to reports and articles regarding the environmental benefits of the growth and soil nourishment of the lentils, chickpeas and beans featured in the ads. Because we considered both ads would be understood as promoting the general benefits to the environment of reducing meat protein in substitution for plant protein, we concluded the claims “better for the planet” in ad (a) and would “help the planet” in ad (b) were not misleading. We investigated the ads under BCAP Code rules3.13.1Advertisements must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.3.23.2Advertisements must not mislead consumers by omitting material information.

Ads which make that point in general terms, and do not contain claims about an advertised product, are likely to be acceptable. However, the ASA understands that some plant-based products may contain a combination of ingredients, which may have been subject to complex production processes – such products could theoretically result in their having a similar or greater negative environmental impact than basic plant ingredients, or a meat-based alternative. The Code requires that environmental claims about an advertised product are based on its full life cycle and if they are not, such claims are likely to breach the Code unless the ad makes this clear and does not mislead consumers about the product’s total environmental impact. A product’s environmental benefit cannot be assumed, and in the absence of robust evidence to support any objective claim, ads that feature such claims are likely to be misleading." ;

Their advertising strapline ‘helping everyone eat better’ encapsulated that message. Sainsbury’s said it was well documented that different foods had varying carbon footprints over their life cycle from production, through to waste in consumers’ homes. They realised the importance of providing a basis for their claims, to help consumers’ general understanding of both the health and environmental impacts of their dietary choices. Because it was such a complex and detailed topic, Sainsbury’s wanted to share the information with consumers in an easy to digest manner, which could not be done within the terms and conditions of the ads. A URL in the ads linked to website content which encouraged consumers to ‘find out more’. Sainsbury’s said The Eatwell Guide was produced by Public Health England and research showed that if the UK population ate in accordance with that Guide, it would be better for the planet than the current average UK diet. The benefits of adopting those dietary recommendations included a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, land use and water use. Current data suggested that 20% of average diets were made up predominantly of red meat, processed meat and poultry and not enough fish, beans, pulses and other legumes. Sainsbury’s said making changes to the type and amount of protein containing foods eaten, was one of the ways to achieve a diet more in line with the Eatwell Guide. They said they were encouraging consumers to try reducing a small amount of their meat intake and replace it with plant-based proteins with the “try your half-est” recipe suggestions, which met the requirements of the Eatwell Guide.Sainsbury’s said beans, chickpeas and lentils were all legumes which meant they produced their own nitrogen or were nitrogen-fixing plants. That meant that the soil they were grown in did not require nitrogen fertiliser which would significantly contribute to a crop’s typical energy of production. They also said those nitrogen-fixing legumes left residual nitrogen in the soil, so when good farming practices were followed, crop rotations could help a non-nitrogen-fixing plant’s yield and reduce the need for intensive fertilisers. Further information could be found on the website. Regarding whether legumes from abroad could be better for the environment than eating domestically produced meat, Sainsbury’s said they did not specifically address transportation on their website, but the data in the research papers linked to on the website did address the whole life cycle of different foods, which included transportation. They referred to a January 2020 paper by Our World in Data which stated that ‘eat local’ was a common recommendation to reduce the carbon footprint of a diet, but transport tended to account for a small share of greenhouse gas emissions and that for most food products, it accounted for less than 10% and was much smaller for the largest greenhouse gas emitters, for example in beef from beef herds, it was 0.5%. Sainsbury’s said the research data showed that for plant-based foods the production, up until transportation was a lot less carbon intensive than the production up until transportation of animal-based foods. They said the evidence demonstrated it was irrelevant that beans, pulses and lentils came from abroad or that beef or chicken could be produced domestically, and that switching out half of meat for plant-based alternatives was still a beneficial swap for the planet. Clearcast said the claim in ad (b) was qualified by the following text “‘Research shows eating in line with UK dietary guidelines will be better for the planet than the current average UK diet. Find out more at https://about.sainsburys.co.uk/helpingeveryoneeatbetter’. They said it explained that the claim was based on research into the effects of UK dietary guidelines. The stated web URL led to a landing page with additional information outlining the basis of the claims, and both the ‘Eatwell Guide’ and related ‘Carbon Trust’ study were clearly signposted for viewers to access and showed the beneficial impact on the environment. Clearcast referred to the Our World Data paper titled “You want to reduce the carbon footprint of your food? Focus on what you eat, not whether your food is local”. They referenced a quotation which stated that producing 1 kg of beef emitted 60 kg of greenhouse gases, while peas emitted 1 kg per kg. They said the research demonstrated that transportation accounted for a very small percentage of the total carbon footprint of plant-based foods and that production of plant-based foods was significantly less carbon intensive than the production of animal-based foods. Radiocentre said they endorsed the advertiser's response, with the substantiation provided. They also said that the radio ad made clear the basis of the claim to listeners, i.e. that chickpeas made their own \"natural fertiliser\" and also directed listeners to the evidence to support the claim. Trading Standards said that they had not provided any assured advice in relation to the ads. However, in discussions regarding the “Help everyone eat better” claim, it was made clear that any claims made would not be linked to any specific Sainsbury’s ready meals but would be in relation to the promotion of the UK Government Eatwell Guidance and the health and environmental benefits of moving to that model. In addition, the ads should highlight a web page where consumers could go for more information about the claims beyond what a TV or radio ad would allow. Trading Standards said they believed the focus of the ads was on improving health and the environment by the substitution of meat with plant alternatives and illustrated examples of protein substitutes. They did not believe that consumers would interpret the ads as a comparison of imported beans, lentils or chickpeas with domestically reared meat." ;

At Repsol, we are committed to renewable hydrogen as an energy source that offers up different uses such as zero net emissions synthetic fuel production”. The ad also featured a series of graphics: the text “H2” encircled by two arrows; a solar panel with a sun; a car with a stylised letter “e” that had a plug at the end; a wind turbine; two arrows that formed a circle; a sapling; and a petrol pump with a leaf on it.
Adfree Cities challenged whether the ad was misleading because it omitted significant information about the overall environmental impact of Repsol’s business activities.
By ruling of October 18, 2023, the Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) upheld that complaint.
The CAP Code stated that unqualified environmental claims could mislead if they omitted significant information.
The ad appeared on the FT website and in the FT digital energy newsletter. It would therefore have been of interest to investors and those interested in purchasing Repsol’s products. Both audiences would be interested in seeking out businesses, including oil and gas companies, who were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services, including those developing alternative fuels such as renewable hydrogen. However, consumers and many business readers were unlikely to be aware of the specific details of such technology – for example, that the development of renewable hydrogen was in its infancy and was not yet commercially available.
Both consumers and business readers were likely to understand the ad to mean that renewable hydrogen was an alternative to fossil fuels. The ad gave the impression that renewable energy products, including renewable hydrogen, comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Repsol developed and sold, or were likely to develop or sell in the near future.
Repsol’s operations in transforming several of their industrial complexes to aid in the production of renewable hydrogen would not commence until 2024, and their development and production of renewable hydrogen was not yet in operation.
Repsol’s carbon emissions stood at 171 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2021 (50% of the emissions of the UK in 2021, 346.7 Mt CO2e), and they produced approximately 600,000 barrels of oil per day. They also had a substantial oil and gas exploration strategy, owning an interest in 40,660 acres (gross) of oil and gas development and exploration across Europe, Latin America, North America, Africa, and Asia and Oceania. Large-scale global oil and gas investment and exploration therefore formed the vast majority of Repsol’s business interests.
Further information about the proportion of Repsol’s overall business model that comprised lower carbon energy was material information that should have been included in the ad. It therefore omitted material information and was likely to mislead.
The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again in the form complained of. It told Repsol to ensure that their future ads featuring environmental claims did not mislead by omitting significant information about the proportion of their business activities that were comprised of renewable energy, or the role renewable energy and renewable hydrogen played in their business activities.""" ;

Not upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “Scientists believe that carbon capture is a critical technology to help meet the world’s ambitious goals for reducing CO2 emissions” to mean that there was a scientific consensus supporting the premise that carbon capture will be crucial in reducing global CO2 emissions. The CAP Code stated that in order to avoid misleading their audience, marketing communications must not suggest that claims were universally accepted if a significant division of informed or scientific opinion existed. We considered that the claim would need to reflect a strong informed or scientific consensus in order not to mislead. We noted the contents of the extensive reviews of carbon capture produced by the Royal Society of Chemistry and the Royal Academy of Engineering, both of which concluded that any approach to global decarbonisation would need to include carbon capture as an integral component. A 2019 report from the Committee on Climate Change to Parliament featured broadly similar conclusions and stated carbon capture deployment in the UK was needed. We considered that these three publications, all of which were extensive in scope and had been published by independent bodies, pointed towards a prevailing consensus among scientists that carbon capture would be necessary for reducing global CO2 emissions. We considered that while other forms of CO2 emission reductions, such as improvements in efficiency and the discontinuation of fossil fuels entirely, might be more effective at reducing CO2 emissions, there appeared to be a broad consensus that carbon capture was an additional technology that would be critical in combatting global carbon emissions. We considered the evidence provided indicated that carbon capture, alongside other important methods such as replacing fossil fuels with renewable alternatives and improving fuel efficiency, would be critical in combating global carbon emissions. We therefore concluded there was not a significant division of informed or scientific opinion on the issue and that the claim was not misleading. On that point we investigated the ad under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation), and3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Exaggeration), but did not find it in breach. 2. Not upheld The ASA considered that consumers would interpret the claim that Esso was “a leader in both research and deployment of carbon capture technology” to mean that Esso was one of a number of companies leading the way in both research and active use of carbon capture technology. We acknowledged the reports provided by Esso and noted they had been produced by the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute, an internationally recognised think tank in the area of CCS, of which Esso was a member. We noted the contents of the 2019 update from the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute on Historical Carbon Capture & Injection Volumes which showed ExxonMobil, Esso’s parent company, had cumulatively captured more CO2 than other companies operating in the field, as of 2019. The contents of the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute’s Global Status Report for 2019 showed ExxonMobil as holding around 21% of operational CO2 capture capacity, on a net equity interest basis. In addition, the information showing the number of patents ExxonMobil had been granted for carbon capture technology between 2010 and 2019 was the highest of their competitors in that country. We considered, based on the information provided, ExxonMobil was clearly one of a number of leaders in the field of carbon capture. We considered the evidence provided indicated that Esso was one of a number of companies leading research, development and deployment of carbon capture technology. We therefore concluded Esso’s claim to be a leader in the field was not misleading. On that point we investigated the ad under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising) and3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(substantiation), but did not find it in breach. 3. Not upheld The ASA considered consumers would understand the claim “This includes new approaches, like using fuel cells that could capture … CO2”, in the context of the ad, to mean that Esso were exploring the possibility of using new approaches that would have the effect of reducing CO2 emissions by capturing and storing CO2. We understood the complainant was concerned that the claims about carbon capture were misleading because the advertised fuel cells were not functionally capable of carbon capture. We understood that the term “fuel cells” in the ad had been used to refer to MCFCs. We noted Esso’s explanation of how MCFCs operated, which included capture and storage of CO2. We understood that MCFCs were currently in development and so any statements about their efficacy were likely to be theoretical, or at least based on preliminary trials. We considered that few consumers would be aware of the difference between fuel cells, which we understood were generally functionally incapable of capturing CO2, and MCFCs, which were a type of fuel cell that, in theory, were capable of CO2 capture and storage. However, we considered that Esso had likely used the term “fuel cells”, when referring to MCFCs, as a way of simplifying the term and the message for lay consumers. We therefore concluded the claim was not misleading. On that point we investigated the ad under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising), and 11.2 (Environmental claims), but did not find it in breach." ;

Esso Petroleum Company Ltd (Esso) said the weight of scientific opinion supported the assertion that carbon capture would be important in reducing global CO2 emissions. They said global energy demand was increasing and that even with the growth of non-fossil fuels, mitigating the effects of fossil fuel usage through carbon capture was vital. They cited reports from the Royal Society of Chemistry, The Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Committee on Climate Change to Parliament, and the UK Committee on Climate Change in substantiation of the claim. 2. Esso said their parent group ExxonMobil, had researched, developed and applied technologies that could play a role in the widespread deployment of carbon capture over the last 30 years. They said they had a working interest in one fifth of the world’s carbon capture capacity and had captured over 7,000,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2017. They also provided 2018 data from the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute that they said showed ExxonMobil had captured more CO2 than any other company since 1970. Esso said in 2019 they had been involved in the start-up of the Gorgon LNG project in Australia, in which they held a 25% share. That project, they said, was one of the largest in the world. Additionally, they were involved in a joint venture with a Qatari petroleum producer that would capture 2,000,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. They had also signed agreements with ports in the Netherlands and Belgium to capture, transport and store CO2. They were a founding member of a multi-industry coalition that promoted policies to support carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) deployment in the US, a partner in a US Department of Energy-sponsored research facility, and a leading member of a US government advisory committee that was developing ways to integrate CCUS into the energy and industrial marketplace. They provided a copy of the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute’s 2019 Global Status Report on that point. They said ExxonMobil had also been granted more patents in the US between 2010 and 2019 for carbon capture than any of their competitors in that country. 3. Esso said Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) were functionally capable of carbon capture. They explained an MCFC, in common with traditional fuel cells, had an anode and a cathode – the anode was fuelled with hydrogen from natural gas, and the cathode was fuelled with oxygen and CO2 from industrial emissions which then formed carbonate. When carbonate reacted with hydrogen an electrical circuit was created. MCFC were therefore powered partly by natural gas and partly by CO2 captured from industrial activity. CO2 could then be compressed and piped underground for storage." ;

A blob-like cartoon figure rose up out of the beer and announced, “Welcome to Camden Town Brewery, yeah!”. The figure propelled the woman along, whooping and stating “Tanks! Kegs!” The woman asked in an excited tone “And what else?” and the figure, brandishing a pint of beer, replied, “What more do you want? It’s refreshing Camden Beer!” The background depicted, in succession, workers playing and swinging near large tanks of beer, a polar landscape with an animated polar bear and penguin in high-vis jackets among large beer cans, and neon signs which included “OFF YOU POP”, “THE TOUR IS OVER”, “IN A WHILE CROCODILE” and “XOXO”.

However, the BCAP Code required that, in addition to appropriate targeting, alcohol ads must not be likely to appeal strongly to people under 18 years of age, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture or showing adolescent or juvenile behaviour. It also required that they must not include a person or character whose example was likely to be followed by those aged under 18 years or who had a strong appeal to those aged under 18. The ad was set in a pub and a brewery and featured an adult character ordering a pint of beer. We considered that, broadly speaking, it was animated in a style similar to cartoon programmes aimed at a mature audience. While we acknowledged that those elements were adult-oriented and would not necessarily be familiar or attractive to under-18s, we considered that other aspects of the ad were more playful and child-like. The colours were bold and striking, notably the bright red of the bar, the yellow and orange of the beer river and the bright wall of neon signs. We considered that younger viewers were likely to find that imagery engaging. The character was dragged through a beer pipe and taken on a journey through a fantastical-looking world with surreal background characters and a beer river. We considered that those features would be seen as fun and engaging, and likely to appeal to a younger audience. The beer guide character was also brightly coloured, rounded and could change shape. We considered that it looked amiable and friendly, had soft facial features including rounded cheeks, and could be said to resemble a make-believe character in a children’s book or TV programme. We therefore considered that its appearance was likely to appeal to under 18s. Furthermore, we considered its behaviour was playful and unpredictable: it uttered exclamations, changed mood suddenly and seemed excited to push the visitor down the river at speed. The character reappeared at the end of the ad and engaged with viewers by winking and giving a thumbs-up sign. We considered that the actions of the beer guide character were juvenile and engaging, and therefore added to its appeal to younger viewers. For those reasons, we considered that the ad was likely to appeal strongly to people under 18. We therefore concluded it was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 19.15.1 and 19.15.2 (Alcohol)." ;

They believed it had a very clear adult tone throughout, and pointed out that it made no reference to youth culture. They asserted that the inclusion of animated characters alone would not make an ad of strong appeal to under-18s; they cited cartoon shows such as Family Guy, South Park and Futurama that were aimed at an adult audience. While they acknowledged that animation could appeal to children, after reviewing previous ASA rulings and the CAP Advice on “Alcohol: the use of cartoons, animals and characters” they concluded that stylisation, nature of drawings, tone and context were key in determining appeal. The colour palette, tone and style of the animation were dark, earthy and dull, with a focus on on-brand colours where appropriate, and used a painterly, sophisticated illustrative style. They said the colours were not bold or striking, and contrasted that with the flat style and bright, predominantly primary colours commonly seen in children’s cartoon shows. The characters were styled and accessorised to portray them as adults; the shape of the eyes was wide and squashed, rather than the oversized, bright and standout look that might appeal to children. They did not find the 'beer guide' slapstick or humorous; he was friendly rather than playful or juvenile. The voice artists were chosen because they did not have “cute” or childish voices. The soundtrack was bespoke drum and bass, of a tone and pitch that would appeal to adults rather than children, as that musical style had originated in the 1990s. The ad was set in a licensed public house and a brewery. The pub scene featured beer taps, a pub quiz sign, adult animated characters drinking beer and the phrase “pint of the usual” and the neon signs depicted those often found in bars. They believed those elements would not be familiar to or appeal to under-18s. Similarly, the brewery was clearly signposted “Camden Town Brewery Experience” and since brewery experiences were always restricted to over 18s, they believed that ensured the ad remained rooted in an environment that under 18s would not have experience of. The beer tanks and kegs were cleaned by adult characters, and the penguins and polar bears were not portrayed as “cute” or behaving in a juvenile manner, with the polar bear featuring piercings, tattoos and exposed claws, and the penguin having unnerving eyes. The brief scene with neon signs gave the atmospheric feel of a bar, consistent with the ad’s pervasive adult environment, and the final scene was very product focused with a glass of beer and beer cans, and featured the phrase “that’s fresh as hells”, which under-18s were unlikely to be familiar with. The blob-like beer guide character was an extension of the beer river and was chosen to bring the brewery tour to life. It was the amber colour of beer, rather than a bright yellow colour which would appeal to children. Its colour was consistent throughout, to illustrate that it was an extension of the beer, to maintain the adult tone and remove any appeal to children. Camden Town Brewery explained that they had rejected any versions of the character that looked “cute” or relatable to children. It had a deep rather than a high-pitched voice, did not behave in a juvenile or adolescent manner, and in the penultimate scene it changed to have fiery, scary eyes and a ghostly creepy voice, which they believed would have the opposite effect of appealing to children. The character was not based on any existing characters and therefore would have no latent appeal to under-18s. They said the animation and style of the ad was synonymous with the Camden Town Brewery’s brand, which was well-established. Clearcast said the ad had received a DC alcohol scheduling restriction, which ensured that it was not transmitted in or adjacent to children’s programmes or programmes commissioned for, principally directed at or likely to appeal particularly to audiences below the age of 18. They carefully considered the animation style and characters used prior to clearance and were satisfied they were not likely to have strong appeal to under-18s. They referred to a previous ASA ruling on a broadcast ad for Camden Town Brewery which had been judged not to be of strong appeal to under-18s. That ad had used a similar style of animation and had featured a talking cat and a pair of wacky-looking colourful characters. They considered the animation style to be more in line with a cartoon aimed at an adult audience than something that would be seen in children’s programming. They believed the characters had mature, clearly adult voices, did not behave in a juvenile or adolescent manner and did not depict youth culture. They had worked closely with Camden Town Brewery to help them ensure that the beer guide character was not likely to have any strong youth appeal. They believed the character did not have “cutesy” features, like big pink lips and oversized eyes, in the style of a children’s cartoon or anime character. The previous ad for Camden Town Brewery, which had been judged not to be of strong appeal to under-18s, had featured a talking pint glass character with a smiling mouth and a beery hand that gave a thumbs-up sign. Clearcast believed the beer guide was similar in style to that character." ;

It’s broad energy for a brighter future”. The relevant advertising code stated that unqualified environmental claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. The ad appeared in The Economist magazine, which was read by consumer and business readers, as well as politicians and public policy professionals. The Advertising Standards Authority, therefore, considered members of those groups as the ad’s likely audience. While the ad was not for a directly purchasable product or service, the ASA considered it was likely to raise Equinor’s profile and influence readers’ opinions of Equinor as a brand by increasing awareness of their activities and plans in the UK. However, ads were likely to mislead if they exaggerated the contribution that lower-carbon initiatives played, or would play in the near future, as part of the overall balance of a company's activities when making claims about green initiatives. The claim “Wind, oil, gas, carbon capture” gave equal prominence to each activity. It was likely to be interpreted to mean that carbon capture and energy sourced from windfarms formed a significant proportion of Equinor’s current and near future activities, alongside oil and gas." ;

From 1 October 2022, the CAP Code stated that marketing communications for gambling products must not be likely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture. They must not include a person or character whose example was likely to be followed by those aged under 18 years or who had strong appeal to those aged under 18. We noted that managers of Premier League football teams were considered high risk within the CAP guidance “Gambling and lotteries: Protecting under-18s” in terms of how likely they were to be of strong appeal to under-18s. Football was an activity in which a very significant proportion of under-18s participated directly on a frequent basis, and had a general interest in through following professional teams and players across a variety of media. There was also a highly developed infrastructure around organised participation and the sport had an exceptionally high media profile including popular, dedicated media for under-18s. Managers of top clubs were likely to appeal strongly to children. We noted the ads included Eddie Howe, David Moyes, Frank Lampard, Brendan Rodgers and Gary O’Neil, who at the time of publication, were all current Premier League managers and would be well known to those who followed football, and in particular fans of the clubs they managed, including children. We considered based on those factors, that all five managers were likely to be of strong appeal to under-18s. Although we considered that the social media accounts provided to us by Ladbrokes were unlikely to be run by Eddie Howe or his team, and that, based on their content, were more likely fan accounts, we accepted that he had little or no presence on social media. However, that did not override our assessment that, for the reasons given above, he was likely to be of strong appeal to under-18s. We considered that it would have been acceptable for the ads to appear in a medium where under-18s, for all intents and purposes, could be entirely excluded from the audience. That would apply in circumstances where those who saw the ads had been robustly age-verified as being 18 or older, such as through marketing lists that had been validated by payment data or credit checking. We did not consider that marketing data, inferred from user behaviour, met that threshold. We acknowledged that the ads were targeted at over-25s, but because Twitter was a media environment where users self-verified on customer sign-up, and did not use robust age-verification, we considered that Ladbrokes had not excluded under-18s from the audience with the highest level of accuracy required for ads the content of which was likely to appeal strongly to under-18s. For those reasons, we concluded the ads were irresponsible and breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) 16.1, 16.3 and 16.3.12 (Gambling)." ;

They said the post contained no calls to action, no promotional offers and no links directing consumers to the Ladbrokes website where they could place bets. The Ladbrokes’ Twitter feed and respective tweets could not be accessed by users unless Twitter had accepted their age as being over-18. They understood that Twitter users self-verified their age, and because that was not always accurate, they had added an additional level of assurance by targeting the ad on social media to only reach over-25s. The data showed a total of 22,182 impressions, and that 0% of their targeted audience was under 25 years of age. Ladbrokes said the image used in the first tweet was designed in-house, and that Eddie Howe’s online presence and career record had been considered during that process. They provided links to what they believed were his Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts, with all three accounts having less than 1,000 followers. They said most of his managerial career had been spent in the lower leagues of English football. They believed that because Eddie Howe had a modest online presence and much of his managerial career had been spent outside of the Premier League, it was unlikely that he would appeal strongly to under-18s. Ladbrokes acknowledged that the second tweet was commercial in nature as it contained market prices for the next Premier League manager to lose his job. They said it inadvertently included imagery of the managers, which was contrary to their guidance and standard procedure for commercially oriented content. They said they had taken steps to ensure that content of that nature would be reviewed more thoroughly to ensure future ads would comply with the advertising rules." ;

Although the gas would be extracted off the coast of WA and much of it burned overseas, it would affect the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland by fuelling climate change, which is causing repeated coral bleaching events on the reef. Scarborough has never been approved under Australia’s federal environment protection law - the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (EPBC Act) -  because offshore gas and oil projects are assessed in a streamlined process by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA) and exempt from the EPBC Act’s operation. However, that exemption does not apply if an offshore project is likely to have a significant impact on the World or National Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef. The applicant, the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) believes the greenhouse gas emissions that will result from the Scarborough project are likely to have a significant impact on the Great Barrier Reef. Accordingly, the ACF will argue this means the project should not be allowed to proceed unless the project – and its impacts on the reef – are approved under the EPBC Act." ;

The MPF alleges that the defendants' occupation of the land was illegal because it was part of an Agro-Extractivist Settlement Project (PAE), owned and managed by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and occupied by traditional extractivist communities. This ACP was filed following a set of 22 lawsuits filed by the MPF as a result of the investigation carried out in Civil Inquiry No. 1.13.000.001719/2015-49 into illegal deforestation carried out inside the Antimary Agro-Extractivist Settlement Project (PAE), and is the result of the same CI. The lawsuit was filed following the termination without resolution of the merits of case 1022785-39.2021.4.01.3200, based on the identification of the individuals who had in fact deforested the same area that was the subject of the lawsuits. The lawsuit is based, among other things, on Brazilian environmental law, concerning the constitutional protection of the environment, the accusation of deforestation, propter rem civil liability for environmental damage, including climate damage, and collective moral damages. It also mentions the unauthorized emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) caused by the illegal deforestation of the area, calculated at 1,088,203.70 tons of carbon dioxide and which are directly related to the Brazilian State's departure from its climate goals, out of step with national and international commitments assumed by Brazil in the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009) and in the Paris Agreement (promulgated by Federal Decree 9,073/2017). Urgent relief is requested under the terms specified in the initial petition. On the merits, it requests, among other things: (i) compensation for the damage caused by illegal deforestation; (ii) payment of compensation corresponding to intermediate and residual material environmental damage; (iv) payment of compensation corresponding to climate damage; and (v) payment of compensation corresponding to collective moral damage." ;

They must not include a person or character whose example was likely to be followed by those aged under 18 years or who had strong appeal to those aged under 18. The ASA noted that prominent sportspeople including tennis players at the highest level and who had a significant national profile were considered high risk within the CAP guidance “Gambling and lotteries: Protecting under 18s” in terms of how likely they were to be of strong appeal to under 18s. The ads featured Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Nick Kyrgios and Stefanos Tsitsipas who were tennis players who had all appeared in a Grand Slam final in the previous year. Djokovic and Nadal had each recently been ranked as the world’s number one player and had the joint record for the most Grand Slam titles won. They were both considered two of the best and most successful players in the world for well over a decade. Kyrgios had reached the final of Wimbledon in 2022 and Tsitsipas reached the final of the Australian Open in 2023. Both of those recent tournaments had a large amount of media coverage in the UK and were high-profile events which we considered would have been of interest to those under 18. For those reasons, we considered that all four were ‘star’ players who had a high profile in tennis and would be considered high risk according to the CAP guidance, and therefore were likely to be of strong appeal to those under 18. We acknowledged that the data provided by Ladbrokes showed that the vast majority of the followers each player had on social media were over 18 and that their commercial partnerships were with adult focused brands. However, that did not override our assessment that the players featured in the ads were likely to be of strong appeal to under 18s based on the factors above. We considered that it would have been acceptable for the ads to appear in a medium where those under 18, for all intents and purposes, could be entirely excluded from the audience. That would apply in circumstances where those who saw the ads had been robustly age-verified as being 18 or older, such as through marketing lists that had been validated by payment data or credit checking. We did not consider that marketing data inferred from user behaviour met that threshold. We acknowledged that the ads were targeted at the over 25s, but because Twitter was a media environment where users self-verified on customer sign-up, and did not use robust age-verification, we considered that Ladbrokes had not excluded the under 18s from the audience with the highest level of accuracy required for ads, the content of which was likely to appeal strongly to this age group. For those reasons, we concluded the ads were irresponsible and breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) 16.1, 16.3 and 16.3.12 (Gambling)." ;

Two of the tweets celebrated Novak Djokovic’s impressive run of form while the other two tweets were polls which asked users to vote on tennis-related questions during the Australian Open. Ladbrokes acknowledged that the tweets referenced and included imagery of prominent players, but stated that they reviewed each player’s media profile, follower demographic, and sponsorship partnerships to assess whether the players would be likely to strongly appeal to under 18s. They provided data on the number of followers each player had on Facebook and Instagram broken down by age groups, which showed that hardly any of their followers, especially on Twitter, were below the age of 21. They believed that the data indicated that all four players appealed to an older audience rather than under 18s. They also stated that each player had partnerships with brands which they believed appealed to adults. For example, they said Djokovic had partnerships with brands including Peugeot, Hublot and ANZ Banking. They said they understood that Twitter users self-verified their age, and because that was not always accurate, they had added an additional level of assurance by targeting the ads on social media to only reach over-25s. The data showed that the impressions for all four ads varied between 24,653 and 35,050, with only one impression in the 18-24 age bracket.

They must not include a person or character whose example was likely to be followed by those aged under 18 years or who had strong appeal to those aged under-18. The ASA considered that Christmas and the traditions surrounding it were likely to have strong appeal to children. Furthermore, the CAP guidance on “Gambling and lotteries: Protecting under-18s” stated Santa Clause was considered high risk in terms of how likely the character was to be of strong appeal to under-18s. We considered that, in a similar vein, children were likely also to find the Christmas elf character appealing. The characters were depicted as colourful cartoons, which, we considered, added to the likelihood of the imagery appealing to children. For those reasons, we considered the ad was likely to be of strong appeal to children. We considered that it would have been acceptable for the ad to appear in a medium where under-18s, for all intents and purposes, could be entirely excluded from the audience. That would apply in circumstances where those who saw the ad had been robustly age-verified as being 18 or older, such as through marketing lists that had been validated by payment data or credit checking. However, because Facebook was a media environment where users self-verified on customer sign-up and did not use robust age-verification, we considered MrQ.com had not excluded under-18s from the audience with the highest level of accuracy required for gambling ads where their content was likely to appeal strongly to under-18s. We acknowledged the steps MrQ.com had taken in response to the complaint but, for the reasons stated above, we nevertheless concluded that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 16.1 and 16.3.12 (Gambling)." ;

MrQ.com believed that having applied the Facebook targeting so that the ad had been kept away from children and young people, they had acted in a socially responsible way. MrQ.com referred to the CAP guidance on “Gambling and lotteries: Protecting under-18s”, specifically that ads targeted in such a way as to effectively remove under-18s from the audience could feature content that would otherwise be prohibited. They had also considered guidance from the IGRG (Industry Group for Responsible Gambling) Industry Code for Socially Responsible Advertising.

The communication is also addressed to, and directly concerns, Saudi Aramco’s business activities in the fossil fuel sector. Saudi Aramco is a State-owned enterprise, owned for 98.5 per cent by the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It holds the exclusive right to explore, drill, prospect, appraise, develop, extract, recover and produce hydrocarbons, as well as to market and distribute hydrocarbons, petroleum products and liquid petroleum gas in the Kingdom. According to the communication, Saudi Amraco’s activities and business strategies are not aligned with the Paris Agreement goals, obligations and commitments, including the ambitions of the Saudi government, and Saudi Amraco’s own responsibilities for human rights protection as a business enterprise under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).
Specifically, despite Saudi Arabia’s net zero targets for 2060, and Saudi Aramco’s own ambition to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050 across its wholly owned operating assets, the company is maintaining production of crude oil; further exploring for oil and gas reserves; expanding into fossil fuel gas; and its misrepresenting information about GHG emissions. Rather than cutting fossil fuel production and emissions ‘at the rapid rate necessary to meet the 1.5°C climate mitigation goal’, it is expanding its fossil fuel activities based on the argument that it has ‘low-cost production’ compared to other countries.
According to the UN Special Procedures, this approach undermines ‘the ability of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to discharge its duties under international law and commitments in the context of the Paris Agreement’, and further ‘disregards Saudi Aramco’s own responsibility to reduce production to address its climate change-related human rights impacts’, as much as other companies. In fact, based on ‘the size, sector, operational context, ownership and structure of Saudi Aramco’ – including the fact that it is a State-owned company – and ‘in the context of the alleged contributions of its business operations to the severity of the human rights impacts of climate change’ over time, there is a ‘heightened expectation’ that this company takes its responsibility under international human rights law. Saudi Amraco bears ‘increased responsibility […] existing over and beyond compliance with applicable laws [...] to act fully in line with international standards and best practices to prevent and mitigate against the human rights impacts of climate change’.
International responsibilities to protect human rights by mitigating GHGs through its own business activities and products follow from the UNGPs (2011), HRC Resolution 48/13 (2021) and UNGA Resolution 76/300 (2022) on the Right to a Clean, Healthy and Sustainable Environment, and the UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment (2018). Special attention is drawn to the report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment on States’ obligations in relation to climate change (A/74/161), stating that ‘further exploration for additional fossil fuels’ must be prohibited because ‘not all existing reserves can be burned while still meeting the commitments of the Paris Agreement’. In addition, States must prohibit the most polluting and environmentally destructive fossil fuel activities, including ‘oil and gas produced from hydraulic fracturing’. All of this follows from the right to a healthy environment, and related human rights,  ‘including the rights to life, health, food, water, housing and culture’.
In relation to ‘access to information’, Saudi Arabia acts in violation of ‘international human rights standards that require that businesses should ensure adequate and accurate disclosure and reporting of their climate impacts in an accessible manner’. Saudi Amraco omits important information about Scope 3 emissions from its reporting and advertising, which is ‘inconsistent with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures standards’. Inaccurate information on GHG emissions can lead to underestimating the climate change crisis, and in turn, exacerbate negative human rights impact due to climate change. Therefore, all companies ‘should refrain from supporting and/or engaging in public information campaigns based on inaccurate, misleading, and unfounded assertions that harm the ability of States and the public to make informed decisions pertaining to climate change’.
Finally, the communications note that Saudi Amraco increasingly sought and received private financial support from a range of financial institutions, e.g. through borrowing funds, selling bonds or equities, or getting support for financial transactions, or for investments in its oil and gas infrastructures. Each of these financial activities help finance the harmful activities of Saudi Amraco that ‘are contributing to climate change-related human rights impacts’, in a manner that is contrary to the human rights responsibilities of these financial institutions.

The YouTube video, posted from Wild’s account and titled “Wild Natural deodorant – Sustainable & 100% Effective”, featured shots of a model applying and then throwing aside a series of spray-on deodorants while appearing itchy and uncomfortable. The Wild product’s packaging then appeared on-screen, and the model was seen applying the product before smelling her armpits and smiling. The accompanying voice-over stated, “You’re giving yourself bad B.O. when you don’t even realise. I’ve tried just about every traditional deodorant you can buy. Turns out most deodorants block your body from being able to sweat properly. Your pores get clogged with all the sweat and toxins that your body is supposed to release, so you can end up with itchy armpits, and rashes and body odour … Wild uses natural ingredients that absorb odour so your body can sweat like it’s supposed to and smell fresh all day long. It’s not sticky and it lasts all day, and it really does stop body odour even after a sweaty workout … It doesn’t matter where I’m going, I know I’m gonna smell great. If you’re looking for a deodorant that is better for your body … then this is your sign to go Wild.” On-screen text and emojis that mirrored what the voice-over stated were superimposed over the ads’ visuals. The video’s caption included “No Aluminiums or other harsh chemicals”. b. A page on the Wild website, www.wearewild.com, was headed “What is an ‘aluminium-free deodorant’ and should I be using one?” Under the subheading “Aluminium vs Aluminium Salts”, text stated “Many mainstream antiperspirants contain a synthetic group of aluminium salts. This is what is being referred to when deodorants, such as Wild, are labelled ‘aluminium-free’. The function of these synthetic salts is to reduce or even stop sweating by temporarily blocking sweat glands in your underarms. By preventing perspiration, there is less opportunity for the growth of odour-causing bacteria which thrive when sweat lingers on the skin. It's effective, but perhaps not the safest option ... There are various studies linking aluminium salts to some undesirable side effects on health, based on the impacts of these salts being absorbed into the body and upsetting some fine-tuned hormonal balances, for example within the endocrine system. Further research is needed to generate more concrete evidence and accessible explanations, however we do not wish to use them in our deodorant, as the initial findings and research currently available suggest it may not be worth the risk! What we are 100% sure of is that sweating is a natural and healthy process that regulates our body temperature, and we're keen to develop products which work WITH your body's natural functions, rather than AGAINST them.”" ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1. Upheld Ad (a) featured the claim “You’re giving yourself bad B.O.” alongside a shot of a model applying spray-on deodorant. It then referred to “just about every traditional deodorant” before featuring the further claims “most deodorants block your body from being able to sweat properly”, “your pores get clogged with all the sweat and toxins that your body is supposed to release” and “you can end up with itchy armpits, and rashes and body odour”, which were variously accompanied by shots of the model appearing uncomfortable while scratching her armpits or reacting to their odour. The ASA considered that consumers would understand those elements to mean that many competing deodorant or antiperspirant products clogged users’ pores by preventing the release of sweat, and for that reason, caused rashes or itchiness and worsened body odour. We further considered that consumers would interpret the reference to the retention of “toxins the body is supposed to release” as implying that such products interfered with a bodily function that was important to human health, and therefore that there was a possibility that such products’ negative impact could extend beyond the health conditions specifically referenced in the ad. The ad did not explicitly indicate which “traditional” competing products, or competing product types, were the subject of the claims. However, we considered that, because of the emphasis placed on the product’s naturalness and its lack of interference with perspiration, together with the caption’s claim “No Aluminium or other harsh chemicals”, consumers were likely to understand the ad as making a comparative claim that attributed the negative effects on health and body odour it mentioned to any antiperspirant or deodorant product that inhibited sweating, or contained ingredients that were, in general, more synthetic than those of the advertised product. We therefore considered that the advertiser needed to hold robust scientific evidence to not only substantiate that the use of all such competing deodorants or antiperspirants had a negative impact on health and body odour in the ways claimed, but also that, in light of those risks, the advertised product was a safer alternative to those products. The comparative report that the advertiser provided assigned the advertised product and a single competitor product with a “Human Health Impact Score”, which was intended as a relative measure that accounted for the health benefits and risks associated with each product. While the advertised product’s score was higher than that of the competing product, the report did not give details regarding the calculation of each score. Instead of stating exactly which health risks had contributed to each product’s score, it gave general examples of what might be classified as a major or minor health risk and outlined the overall framework through which scores would be calculated. The report did state that some organic compounds used in the competitor’s product could cause mild skin irritation, including the aluminium salt aluminium chlorohydrate, as well as alpha-isomethyl ionone, hydroxycitronellal, and linalool. However, it did not support those assertions by citing the findings of clinical trials conducted on people, nor did it account for the concentration of the competitor product’s ingredients. We understood that factor would necessarily figure into any accurate assessment of the product’s effect on skin. In addition, the website page that linked petrochemical compounds to skin irritation did not state which of such compounds, if any, were commonly found in deodorants or antiperspirants, and did not support its assertions with the findings of clinical trials conducted on people. Further, neither the website nor the report referred to the potential of competitor deodorants or antiperspirants to worsen body odour, or to negative health effects specifically linked to such products’ sweat-inhibiting action. In relation to their impact on health, we understood the scientific consensus was that sweating primarily served to regulate body temperature and that, while trace amounts of some metals and other chemicals could make their way into sweat, the body was in no way dependent on perspiration for the expulsion of toxicants. That was because other mechanisms, such as those of the excretory system, fulfilled that function. For those reasons, we considered that the claims in the ad that all deodorants or antiperspirants with synthetic ingredients, or whose action inhibited perspiration, worsened body odour and were likely to have a negative impact on users’ health, including by irritating skin, had not been substantiated. We concluded that ad (a) was misleading. On this point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.7 (Misleading advertising), and 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors). 2. Upheld Ad (b) featured the claim that antiperspirants containing aluminium salts that inhibited perspiration were “perhaps not the safest option”, as well as that “there are various studies linking aluminium salts to some undesirable side effects on health, based on the impacts of these salts being absorbed into the body and upsetting some fine-tuned hormonal balances, for example within the endocrine system”. Further text stated that “further research is needed to generate more concrete evidence” before the ad went on to feature the further claim that “the initial findings and research currently available suggest that it may not be worth the risk”. We considered consumers would understand those claims to mean that, although the issue was not yet clear-cut, health concerns about the impact of antiperspirants containing aluminium salts on bodily functions reliant on the distribution of hormones were supported by a significant body of preliminary evidence. For that reason, we considered that the ad also encouraged consumers to regard those health concerns as a reason to choose the advertised product, which did not contain aluminium salts, over competitor products that did. We considered that the advertiser therefore needed to hold robust scientific evidence to substantiate the claim that antiperspirants containing aluminium salts harmed users by interfering with bodily functions reliant on the distribution of hormones. However, the advertiser had not provided any evidence consisting of clinical trials conducted on people that supported the claim. We concluded that the claim had not been substantiated and therefore that ad (b) was misleading. On this point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.7, and 3.33 (Misleading advertising)." ;

In relation to whether conventional deodorants were linked to health problems or prevented the body from expelling toxins, Wild Cosmetics Ltd t/a Wild understood that the scientific evidence available in 2023 was inconclusive regarding the status of such claims. For that reason, they stated that they had not intended to directly give the impression that conventional deodorants were certainly harmful. Instead, they had intended for ads (a) and (b) to reflect growing concerns over the possibility that deodorants with synthetic ingredients, or pore-blocking antiperspirants containing aluminium salts, could be detrimental to health. They felt that such concerns were justified by on-going research and reporting into the contents of deodorants and antiperspirants from large manufacturers. They believed that many deodorants or antiperspirants in the UK market contained chemical compounds that could be toxic to people and the environment. They considered aluminium salts, the function of which was to prevent perspiration by temporarily blocking pores, to be an example of such compounds. In addition, they cited a study from a US-based independent laboratory which led to product recalls after it detected high levels of benzene in antiperspirants from several leading brands. They added that the use of parabens, a type of synthetic preservative, was widespread across the UK cosmetics market. They understood that parabens could enter the body and mimic the activity of oestrogen, a hormone that played an important role in the male and female reproductive systems, and that, in doing so, parabens risked causing breast cancer. While they acknowledged that the available scientific evidence was inconclusive in relation to whether that was the case, they considered it likely that stronger evidence would emerge as soon as the issue received sufficient attention. They also understood that many deodorants and antiperspirants contained petrochemicals, which they believed were linked to inflammation, various diseases, and skin irritation. To support that petrochemicals were linked to inflammation, they referred to the website of a US-based distributor of oleochemicals, which were compounds derived from animal or vegetable fats. The page stated that petrochemicals were “skin irritants” in a section that discussed “the benefits of oleochemicals over traditional petrochemicals”.They provided a copy of a report supplied by a third-party consultancy agency, which compared the impact of Wild deodorant on the environment and human health to that of a competing product from a larger manufacturer. The report stated that, excluding fragrance, Wild deodorant’s ingredients, were all vegan, naturally derived, and were not carcinogenic or mutagenic. In contrast, the competing product was found to contain organic compounds derived from petrol and highly processed synthetic ingredients, including butane, which it stated was carcinogenic. Wild added that every ingredient used in their product had been listed as \"green\" by Skin Deep, a cosmetics safety database managed by the Environmental Working Group, a US-based non-profit organisation. They explained that those ratings denoted a high level of safety, which had been confirmed through a review of the scientific and regulatory literature." ;

We sought advice from the Health & Safety Executive.We understood that DiOX D4 was a trade name and that the product contained an active substance Dimethyloctadecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride with the intention of destroying a harmful organism by means other than mere physical or mechanical action and was listed on the European Chemical Agency’s register of active substances. We therefore understood it was likely to be classified as a biocidal product. We referred to the Efficacy Guidance provided by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for Biocidal products, which outlined various forms of data that might be expected to determine the efficacy of a biocidal product. The guidance required comparisons with untreated control samples and an environment representative of real-life conditions of use. In order to substantiate the efficacy claims, we therefore expected to see methodologically-sound evidence that reflected how the product was likely to be used in real life.We considered the evidence provided by Evaq Ltd. We understood that at the time, Covid-19 virus samples could not be used for lab testing, and that manufacturers were using other coronaviruses as a substitute to test the efficacy of their products. The test report described testing of DiOX D4 against the Murine Coronavirus strain MHV-A59, which was a hepatitis virus strain found in mice. Pieces of treated fabric (2 cm2 in size), which included unwashed fabric, as well as fabric which had been subjected to 10 and 20 washing cycles, were placed into sterile petri dishes and inoculated with droplets of the virus. We understood that untreated polyester was used as the control fabric. The results for the testing on the unwashed fabric showed a 95% reduction of the virus after 60 minutes and the results for the testing on the washed fabric showed a 67-68% reduction of the virus after 60 minutes. We understood that the results were equivalent to a log-1.25 reduction and less than log-1 reduction respectively, whereas the ECHA Efficacy Guidance recommended at least a log-4 reduction to show efficacy against viruses. Furthermore, in order to determine the reduction of transmission risk in an enclosed or indoor environment, we considered that it would be relevant to measure the level of viral particles much sooner than 60 minutes after exposure. We considered that the testing did not take into account how the abilities of the coating would be affected by factors involved in the real-life use of the mask, such as moisture or temperature changes from the wearer’s breathing.Although the active substance used in the product had been approved, we considered that we had not seen adequate evidence that COVID-19 and other viruses were killed on contact with the Evaq mask, thus helping to protect wearers from infection. We therefore concluded that the ad was misleading and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading Advertising) and3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

As proteins were subject to change with mutation and variation, using ionic disruption to target the virus was not guaranteed to work, unlike a mechanical kill. They said that the antiviral agent within the coating of the mask killed the virus by breaching its protective outer membrane, and unlike other parts of the virus, the membrane remained the same regardless of any type of mutation which is why it would work against any new variant of coronavirus. Evaq provided a copy of a test report for the product which they said proved the efficacy of DiOX D4 on the mask. They also provided a Material Safety Data Sheet for DiOX D4." ;

The first ad, a post on River Rock's Facebook page, was headed \"Whisky & the Wilderness\". Text stated \"What better way to celebrate the launch of batch #2 than with a whisky tasting at 3500ft? Read our blog about last December’s memorable tasting …”. It was accompanied with images of people mountaineering. A bottle of whisky was shown with the mountaineers in one of the images. b. The second ad, a page on the website www.riverrockwhisky.org/whiskyandthewildnerness, stated \"What better way to mark the launch of River Rock batch #2 than by summiting 3500 feet for a wild whisky tasting with good friends? We, at River Rock … welcomed the opportunity to mark the launch of our second batch with a mountaineering adventure … The destination was the little known mountain wilderness of Black Mount where we were to summit Stob Ghabhar … characterised by its narrow rocky ridges and steep sides ... As with all good adventures, the conditions and landscape were ever changing and as the weather started to close in, it was waterproofs on and ice axes out for the snowy ascent. Snaking up single file with the snow and mist closing in. Thick snow at the summit, with 100ft vertical drops and narrow ridges made for a rewarding and memorable whisky tasting ...\". The ad featured various images of the mountaineers climbing the mountain. One image showed a bottle of River Rock being poured into small tumblers. Another showed someone pouring whisky into a fellow mountaineer's cup. The final paragraph stated “The evening culminated in a welcome dram around the fire and a toast to good friends”, and was accompanied by an image of the group standing around a fire with mugs in their hands and one person pouring whisky into another person’s cup." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "Upheld The CAP Code stated ads must not link alcohol with activities or locations in which drinking would be unsafe. It permitted alcohol ads to feature sporting or physical activities, but stated that ads must not imply those activities were undertaken after the consumption of alcohol. The ASA noted that neither ad showed someone drinking alcohol. However, ad (a) featured the line “What better way to celebrate the launch of batch #2 than with a whisky tasting at 3500ft? Read our blog about last December’s memorable tasting” and we considered consumers were likely to interpret that to mean whisky had been consumed at that altitude. That was compounded by the images of mountaineers shown walking along a narrow, steep, snow-covered ridge high up on a mountain, together with an image of the whisky product with the mountaineers. We considered drinking alcohol in such conditions would be unsafe and therefore ad (a) breached the Code. Ad (b) featured the statements \"What better way to mark the launch of River Rock batch #2 than by summiting 3500 feet for a wild whisky tasting with good friends?” and “Thick snow at the summit, with 100ft vertical drops and narrow ridges made for a rewarding and memorable whisky tasting”. As with ad (a), the images showed people mountaineering in challenging conditions, and the accompanying text highlighted that where it stated the mountain was “characterised by its narrow rocky ridges and steep sides”, “the conditions and landscape were ever changing”, “as the weather started to close in, it was waterproofs on and ice axes out for the snowy ascent”, “snaking up single file with the snow and mist closing in” and “Thick snow at the summit with 100ft vertical drops and narrow ridges”. In addition to the references to a whisky tasting at the summit, there were several images of the whisky product with the mountaineers whilst on the mountain; one of them showed the product being poured into tumblers and one showed a mountaineer pouring the whisky into the mug of a fellow mountaineer. We therefore considered that ad (b) also gave the impression that whisky had been consumed at an altitude of 3,500 feet in the same conditions. Whilst we acknowledged the final paragraph referred to a “welcome dram” and “toast” around the fire in the evening and an image showing the mountaineers in the car park after they had descended the mountain, that did not negate the strong impression that whisky had been consumed on the mountain, after which the participants would need to descend during treacherous weather conditions and on difficult terrain. We therefore considered ad (b) also linked alcohol with activities and locations in which drinking would be unsafe. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule18.1218.12Marketing communications must not link alcohol with activities or locations in which drinking would be unsafe or unwise.Marketing communications must not link alcohol with the use of potentially dangerous machinery or driving. Marketing communications may feature sporting and other physical activities (subject to other rules in this section; for example, appeal to under-18s or link with daring or aggression) but must not imply that those activities have been undertaken after the consumption of alcohol.(Alcohol)." ;

They pointed out that images of bottles and pouring shots were commonly used in whisky marketing and conveyed a sense of the place the whisky was made.

The Complainant alleges that FIFA’s claims that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was carbon-neutral are wrong and likely to mislead consumers in the UK, therefore breaching multiple provisions of the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing (“the Code”), and specifically the provisions on misleading advertising and on environmental claims.
FIFA presented the 2022 Qatar World Cup as “fully carbon-neutral” in its online presence. It operated a “climate pledge” mechanism targeting ticket holders, requesting of them to make efforts towards reducing their carbon footprint in their daily life, and informing those taking the pledge that their emissions were offset by FIFA.
In particular, the Complainant alleges that FIFA:
-	firstly, ignored emissions reductions as an essential part of carbon-neutrality; it did not demonstrate that it has done everything it can to reduce its own emissions prior to compensating for the remaining emissions (e.g. when it decided to attribute the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, a country with little football infrastructure in place).
-	secondly, used unsound methodology for its GHG accounting, breaching the Code by only partially accounting for the life cycle of the stadiums, by sending wrong signals regarding the stadiums’ impact on the environment, and by not taking into account day shuttle flights advertised for by Gulf regional airlines when calculating flight emissions of ticket holders.
-	thirdly, and more broadly, generally claimed that a mega-event like the World Cup can be compensated with offsetting. The carbon credits bought by FIFA fail to meet some of the carbon market standards, as they lack additionality and do not permanently remove carbon. Further, the Code was allegedly breached by FIFA by failing to reach the level of substantiation required for an absolute statement like that of carbon-neutrality.
By claiming carbon-neutrality in this way, FIFA allegedly gave ticket holders the impression that attending the World Cup does not have an impact on the environment.
The claim was joined with four other complaints into one joint proceeding before the Swiss Commission on Fairness. The commission upheld all five claims in June 2023.""" ;

The TV ad featured an animation in which characters sang a song with the lyrics: “We’re messing up the planet. We’re messing up real good. And filling up our bodies with more beige food than we should ...” The animation showed images of buildings and vehicles expelling pollutants, litter, dirty rivers and brown unappetising food. The song continued, “We’re messing around with nature, we’re messing up the sea …”, accompanied by images of litter being thrown into water, whilst a number of people and an otter sailed along the water in a boat. Just as the boat reached a waterfall, which it was about to sail over, the otter stopped it from moving and said, “Woah, what are we doing?” One of the people in the boat, who was holding a guitar, said, “Singing a song about our impending doom.” The otter responded, “Yeah, and you’re egging them on with the …” and the man with the guitar interrupted him and said with realisation “With the guitar and everything, I know.” The otter said, “Ok, let’s try this instead”, then produced a guitar and sang, “Let’s get fixing up the planet. Fix it up real good …” The animation changed to a greener and more colourful colour scheme, and included images of trees being planted. The song continued, “Be kinder to our bodies with nature’s tasty food …”, accompanied by images of fruit being squeezed into an Innocent drinks bottle. The song concluded, “Reduce. Re-use. Recycle. Because there is no planet B. If we’re looking after nature she’ll be looking after me”, accompanied by images of people taking leisure in a lush green environment, with many of them alongside bottles of Innocent drinks. At the end of the ad, a voice-over stated, “Innocent. Little drinks with big dreams for a healthier planet.” b. The paid-for Youtube ad included the same content as ad (a) except that the scene that featured the otter responding to “Singing a song about our impending doom” differed. In that version, the otter responded, “OK that’s mad” to which the man with the guitar responded, “It is a bit isn’t it?” The otter responded, “Let’s try this instead.” The rest of the ad was the same as ad (a) c.

They also required that absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation, but that claims such as “greener” could be justified if the advertised product or service provided a total environmental benefit over that of the advertiser’s previous product or service or competitor products or services and the basis of the comparison was clear. The Codes also said that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise. The ASA considered that ads (a), (b) and (c) all drew a strong association between Innocent Drinks and a positive impact on the environment. We acknowledged that the ad contained aspirational messaging, including imagery of people recycling, choosing natural foods and choosing to “reduce, reuse recycle”, the final line “Little drinks with big dreams for a healthier planet” and a link to the Innocent website for more information, and we considered that some consumers would interpret the ad simply to mean that Innocent had made an aspirational commitment to doing their part to do better for the environment, or that the ad was a call to action for everyone more generally to do better for the planet. However, we considered that many consumers would interpret the overall presentation of the ad to mean that purchasing Innocent products was a choice which would have a positive environmental impact. The ad firstly presented a depiction of a damaged planet and brown food. It then switched to imagery of the planet being ‘fixed up’ whilst Innocent drinks are being consumed alongside images of Innocent products, depicting people and animals relaxing in a green environment. We considered that this implied there was a direct association between choosing Innocent drinks and taking positive action to help the environment. This was reinforced by the lyrics “Let’s get fixing up the planet. Fix it up real good …” and “Reduce. Re-use. Recycle. Because there is no planet B. If we’re looking after nature she’ll be looking after me”, which we considered would be interpreted as a claim that purchasing Innocent products was making an active choice to reduce, re-use and recycle, and was more broadly, a claim that Innocent was environmentally friendly and that purchasing their products had environmental benefits which would help ‘fix up the planet’. Because we considered that the ads would be understood to mean that Innocent was environmentally friendly and that purchasing their products had environmental benefits, we needed to see evidence that was the case. Although we acknowledged that Innocent were undertaking various actions which were aimed at reducing the environmental impact of their products, that did not demonstrate that their products had a net positive environmental impact over their full lifecycles. We also noted that their drinks bottles included non-recycled plastic and that the extraction of raw materials and subsequent processing of those materials in order to produce the bottle would have a negative impact on the environment. Because the ads implied that purchasing Innocent products was a choice which would have a positive environmental impact when that was not the case we concluded that the ads were misleading.

They said that it had environmental credentials, which gave it the standing to make that invitation. However, there was no suggestion in the ad through statements or imagery, that purchasing Innocent products themselves would lead to a positive environmental impact. They said that were the complaint to be upheld, the effect may be to stifle other brands and manufacturers from taking steps towards and communicating information about positive environmental actions they were taking. With regard to the content of the ad itself, the only claim that they were making was “be kinder to our bodies with nature’s tasty food”. They said that the ad was a call to action, asking for their drinkers to join them in making changes happen and which was demonstrated by the change of leadership from the man to the otter. They highlighted that the Innocent branding was used sparingly throughout the ad, and the Innocent logo itself did not appear in the context of purchasable Innocent products. The Innocent smoothie bottle did appear, but only in scenes that demonstrated that Innocent was made using ingredients made from nature. Innocent said that the words and imagery of the ad sought to encourage recycling, both generally (by showing bouncing commonly recyclable receptacles from umbrellas into a recycling bin) and specifically in relation to innocent products (by showing a person dressed in a bottle costume, with the innocent logo, standing next to a recycling bin). Although Innocent considered that the ad did not make a specific environmental claim, they provided substantiation to support their environmental ambitions, which they considered granted them the credentials to make claims about their ambitions. Innocent stated that they were a “B Corp”, which was a certification granted to some companies by the organisation B Lab to companies that demonstrated a high social and environmental performance. Innocent said that they had committed to being carbon neutral by 2030, and had opened a carbon-neutral factory that ran on renewable energy and a cleaning system that reduced water usage by 75%. Innocent said that the end of the ad included the text “Find out more – innocentdrinks.co.uk”. They said that consumers who chose to look at the website after viewing the ad would find information about their various sustainability schemes. With regards to their use of single-use plastics, Innocent said that the ad did not make claims that their use was better than other forms of packaging, and instead sought to show that recycling was better than throwing away. They said that the ad contrasted images of plastic in the water with a world in green where plastic was recycled. They said that their focus as a company was on using the minimum amount of plastic whilst also supporting recycling and their ambition was to recycle 70% of their bottles by 2023. They said that was to be achieved through education and awareness, lobbying for better recycling and deposit return schemes. They also said that they were working on developing more sustainable packaging.Innocent considered that, aside from their credentials as a B Corp, guidance from the Competition and Markets Authority allowed for companies to tell people about their dreams and aspirations for environmental change. Innocent chose to do that in a light-hearted and engaging way in the ad. Innocent highlighted sections of the Guidance which allowed that “Wider environmental goals of the business should also be clearly distinguished from product-specific claims\" and that “Claims about a business’s environmental ambitions must also be in proportion to its actual efforts. They are less likely to be misleading when they are based on specific, shorter term and measurable commitments the business is actively working towards.\" They considered that, because the ad did not make a product-specific claim, but rather a statement about their wider environmental goals, and because they were able to support their environmental ambitions with evidence, the ad did not mislead as to the total environmental benefit of their products. Clearcast responded, in relation to ad (a), that the ad did not make any statements that exaggerated the environmental benefits or actions of Innocent’s products or the company. They said that the first section - including the statements “We’re messing up the planet. We’re messing up real good. And filling up our bodies with more beige food than we should ...”; “We’re messing around with nature … We’re messing up the sea …” - were generally accepted claims and referred to the overall state of the planet, processed food and the effect humans were having on nature. They said that the next element of the ad, which included the “Let’s get fixing up the planet. Fix it up real good …”; “Be kinder to our bodies with nature’s tasty food …”, would be understood as a plea to viewers to try and turn around the damage that had been done, aligned with the efforts that Innocent were themselves making, and to eat healthier foods. Clearcast said that they had requested evidence to support the claim “Reduce, re-use, recycle” which they viewed as a call to action. They said that Innocent had outlined their drive to sustainably source 100% of their ingredients, their plans to make every bottle that they made recyclable and to become carbon neutral by 2030. They believed the reference to dreams would be interpreted as aspirational and that the ad overall would be interpreted as an aspirational call to action to support a better planet in the future, rather than as making specific environmental claims about the products or the company." ;

The second page, headed “Rubbish Removal London” featured text which stated “We’re London and the UK’s largest man and van rubbish removal company, operating exclusively through our own teams based right across London and further afield”.

                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1. Not upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “>95% landfill diversion rate” to mean that more than 95% of the waste collected by Clearabee would not go to a landfill site, but would be diverted elsewhere, for instance, to recycling centres. We assessed the information provided by Clearabee. That information showed, for each Waste Transfer Station visit between 1 August 2019 and 31 October 2019, the difference between the vehicle weight recorded by the Waste Transfer Station when it arrived and the vehicle weight recorded by the Waste Transfer Station when the waste had been tipped, producing an average diversion rate of 95.24% over the period. We considered, therefore, that the evidence provided demonstrated that more than 95% of the waste Clearabee had collected over the period did not go to a landfill site but was instead transferred to a recycling facility, and because of that, we concluded that the claim “>95% landfill diversion had been substantiated and was not misleading. On that point, we investigated the claim under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising) and3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation), but did not find it in breach. 2. Not upheld Similar to the claim investigated under issue 1, we noted that the claim “100+ locations meaning driving distance between jobs is very low” appeared on the page headed “Clearabee and the Environment”. We considered that consumers would understand that driving impacted the environment, and in that context, we considered they would interpret the claim to mean that by operating from more than 100 locations across the UK, the distance required to drive between jobs was relatively short. We assessed the information provided by Clearabee, which we considered demonstrated that they had Clearabee trucks and personnel in more than 100 locations nationally, and that they were able to serve the surrounding regions within which those resources were located. Doing so meant that their average travel between jobs was 11.68 miles, which we considered was relatively low compared with, for example, if they had few inner city locations from which to travel and serve those surrounding regions. In light of the above, we considered that the claim “100+ locations meaning driving distance between jobs is very low” had been substantiated and was not misleading. On that point, we investigated the claim under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising) and3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation), but did not find it in breach. 3. Not upheld We considered that consumers would understand from the claim “Operating exclusively through our own teams” that the services offered by Clearabee would be carried out by Clearabee employees and that they would not be subcontracted to another affiliated business or individual. We assessed the information provided by Clearabee. The first spreadsheet demonstrated that the jobs carried out between 1 August and 31 October 2019 were completed by teams located at Clearabee’s own resource centres across the UK and using a Clearabee-registered vehicle. In addition, we considered that the number of people directly employed by Clearabee, as listed on the additional spreadsheet, indicated that their workforce was sufficient in numbers to carry out jobs from those various locations. We therefore considered that it had been demonstrated that Clearabee offered a service carried out by their own employees, their own trucks and from their own resource centres. In light of the above, we concluded that the claim “Operating exclusively through our own teams” had been substantiated and was not misleading. On that point, we investigated the claim under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising) and3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

Clearbee Ltd said that while there were a finite number of Waste Transfer Stations in the UK and all waste collectors used a selection of the same set of stations, they were able to achieve a good rate of landfill diversion because they controlled all of their own trucks, knew exactly what waste was on board and were able to specify where they transferred their waste. Clearabee said that Waste Transfer Stations separated waste that could be recycled from waste that could not be saved from landfill, and Clearabee were therefore able to know the recycling rate and therefore the landfill avoidance rate for any given station. They provided a spreadsheet which showed every Waste Transfer Station visit for every truck from 1 August 2019 to 31 October 2019, which they believed demonstrated that at least 95.24% of the waste they collected was diverted from landfill during that period. They said Waste Transfer Stations submitted the figures to the Environment Agency and published them on a regular basis, meaning they knew the recycling rate for any given Transfer Station, the exact tonnage they transferred to that station and therefore the landfill avoidance rate. 2. Clearabee provided two snapshots of a map of the UK which they said showed the wide distribution of their trucks. The snapshots were taken at two different times of the week, which they said showed both the home location of their trucks and the areas they served while in operation. They said that with over 100 different geographical locations nationally, collection was likely to be carried out by a vehicle which was strategically positioned to keep average collection journeys low, stating that the average miles travelled per job was 11.68 between 1 August 2019 and 31 October 2019. They said they did not simply have depots with large numbers of trucks in major cities, which would result in much longer journeys for collections to be completed. 3. Clearabee said they made the claim to reassure customers that if they booked their services, they would get a Clearabee truck and team, not a local van to whom the collection was subcontracted. They provided a spreadsheet which they said showed a complete record of the collections carried out through 1 August 2019 to 31 October 2019, with a Clearabee resource location and truck listed against each collection. They also provided a separate spreadsheet which they said showed a full list of Clearabee employees." ;

Not upheld The BCAP Code required that alcohol ads must not be likely to appeal strongly to people aged under 18, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture or showing adolescent or juvenile behaviour. Therefore, alcohol ads in broadcast media must not have content that would be of strong appeal to children, regardless of when they were broadcast. The ASA acknowledged that the imagery of beavers rhythmically chopping and chomping on logs, together with the lively music featured in the ad, had an unusual and whimsical element, and therefore could appeal to some under-18s. However, we considered the overall tone and aesthetic of the ad was predominantly realistic and did not have a humorous or slapstick element to its depiction of the characters. The beavers were shown in their natural environment, against a dark, gloomy colour scheme. Their teeth and claws were clearly visible, which we considered gave an unappealing element to the beavers that would not be attractive to under-18s. While it was apparent that the characters were not real animals, they were not cartoon-like. While the music featured in the ad had a cheerful tone, it did not have any attention-grabbing lyrics, and was more reminiscent of country music. We considered it was unlikely to have significant appeal to children. In addition, the voice-over featured a mature male voice of a comedian popular in the 1990s, which we did not consider to have resonance with under-18s. For those reasons, we concluded that while the ad could have some appeal to people aged under 18, it was unlikely to appeal strongly to them, and was therefore not irresponsible. On that point, we investigated ad (a) under BCAP Code rules 19.15 and 19.15.1 (Alcohol), but did not find it in breach. 2. Not upheld The CAP Code required that alcohol ads must not be likely to appeal particularly to people under 18 years of age. They should not feature or portray real or fictitious characters who were likely to appeal particularly to people aged under 18 in a way that might encourage children and young people to drink. Alcohol ads must not, therefore, have content that would appeal more to under-18s than it would to over-18s. We acknowledged that the use of animated animal characters had the potential to appeal to under-18s. However, for the same reasons set out above, we concluded that the beaver characters, and the other elements in the ad, were also unlikely to have more appeal to under-18s than to over-18s. We therefore concluded the ad was not likely to appeal particularly to people under 18 years of age, and was not, therefore, irresponsible. On that point, we investigated ad (b) under CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 18.14 (Alcohol), but did not find it in breach." ;

They highlighted that the characters were purposefully realistic, with hardened features such as grotesque teeth and uneven claws. They considered that because of that, the characters were not humorous or puppet-like. The voice-over was delivered by a deep, adult male voice, which they said was designed to engage their target consumer. The landscape was realistic, with muted light, to avoid bright and colourful imagery. They considered that the narrative of the characters being at work, undertaking outdoor woodworking in the wild, was not humorous or associated with juvenile behaviour or youth culture. They added that they had targeted the ads to an adult audience through their media placement, and whenever possible their specific target audience of adults aged 25 to 54. Clearcast highlighted that the ad depicted the beavers working in an outdoor environment and did not feature adolescent or juvenile behaviour. Its main message was that a whisky should be earned after a long day of hard work, which they did not consider to be associated with youth culture.

The paid-for Google ad stated “The all-new Kia Niro – Niro EV up to 285 mile range”. b. The website www.kia.com, featured a page titled “The all-new Kia Niro” which included information about Kia’s Niro range of electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid electric cars. A section comparing the features of the three models included text about the electric model that stated “…Range of 285 miles*”. The asterisk linked to small text further down the page that stated “Available with EV powertrain only”." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must state significant limitations and qualifications and qualifications must be presented clearly. The ASA considered consumers would interpret the claim “up to 285 mile range” in ad (a) to mean the Niro EV was capable of achieving a 285 mile range as a maximum on a full battery charge in a significant amount of cases. We considered consumers would interpret the claim “Range of 285 miles” in ad (b) to mean that was the representative mileage range for the car on a full battery. We also considered that with both ads, consumers would understand that the advertised range, in this case 285 miles, could be achieved on an amount of charge which was advisable for the car. The evidence provided by Kia showed the combined range figure produced by WLTP testing was 285 miles, and that figure was calculated from multiple everyday driving scenarios which were recorded repeatedly in a lab environment in identical conditions. The mileage was calculated from the battery starting on 100% charge and ending on 0%. WLTP procedure is the testing process for measuring fuel economy for new cars, electric mileage range, and emissions. Additionally, external reports cited by Kia found that cold weather and inefficient driving styles could result in a lower range. Neither ad (a) nor ad (b) provided information to consumers to explain that the mileage range was based on test data. We acknowledged that Kia believed that the asterisk in “Range of 285 miles*” should have directed readers to a section of the website related to WLTP testing. However, the webpage featuring the claim did not include any qualifying text. Furthermore, we understood that various real-world factors, such as speed, style of driving, weather and route conditions, and the age and condition of the battery might affect the range. If any of those conditions were less than optimal, which we considered would occur often, the range achieved in the Niro EV may have been lower than 285 miles. We considered that was significant information, which was material to consumers’ understanding of the battery range achievable in the Niro EV, and therefore should have appeared in the ads. We acknowledged that the term “up to 285 miles” was used in ad (a) to allow for varying driving styles and external environment scenarios. However, consumers were likely to understand that the figure quoted was the achievable range for the vehicle in standard driving conditions; when this was not necessarily the case, the maximum range would, therefore, not always be met. We considered that the claim “up to 285 miles” required clear qualification to explain what it represented. In addition, while the mileage claim was based on the car starting with 100% charge, we understood that it was generally not advisable to charge the car beyond 80%, and therefore any claim based on a 100% charge was not representative. We considered that this was material information which should have appeared in the ads themselves. We understood that ad (b) had been amended to include the text “Battery range figures are official EU test figures for comparative purposes and may not reflect real driving results. Fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are tested using WLTP […]”. However, we considered consumers would have only been aware of that information if they scrolled to the bottom of the ad and read the full page of text. It was therefore insufficiently prominent to counteract the overall misleading impression given by more prominent claims. Because the ads did not make clear that the quoted battery range figures were not necessarily representative of what a user would achieve, and the amended version of ad (b) did not make that information sufficiently prominent, we concluded that the claims “up to 285 mile range” in ad (a), and “Range of 285 miles” in ad (b) were likely to mislead. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.9 and 3.10 (Qualification), and 3.11 (Exaggeration)." ;

The term “up to 285 miles” was used in ad (a) to allow for varying driving styles and external environment scenarios which could positively or negatively affect the total driving range. Kia consulted with the external organisation IDIADA Automotive Technology which completed the driving range testing for the vehicle in line with the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). The testing produced two range figures. The first was the ‘City’ range figure which specified the maximum mileage when the car was used for concentrated inner city driving. The second was the ‘Combined’ range figure which specified the maximum mileage when the car was used in everyday conditions. The combined range figure was calculated from multiple everyday driving scenarios. Those driving scenarios were recorded repeatedly in a lab environment in identical conditions. Kia said the ‘City’ range figure was 375 miles and the ‘Combined’ range figure was 285 miles. They had only used the ‘Combined’ WLTP figure in the ads, because they assumed a variance in customer driving and wished to provide a fair representation of the vehicle’s range capability. They provided the ‘Whole Vehicle Type Approval’ (WVTA) document, produced by IDIADA Automotive Technology, which outlined the WLTP testing for the Niro EV. They said a WVTA was required for all vehicles to certify compliance with safety, environmental, and conformity of production requirements. Following a repeated test procedure on a set of vehicles, a WVTA was granted. Kia said, that like all other manufacturers, they were legally bound to present those figures and only those to the public. The 285 miles (combined) range was not their own, but one that had to be legally presented. Kia said that the asterisk in “Range of 285 miles*” in ad (b) should have taken consumers to a section of the website related to WLTP testing. Kia stated that if a Niro EV displayed that it was 100% charged, the vehicle would present a range figure on the dashboard which stated the range the vehicle’s computer believed the car could achieve on that charge. That information would be based on previous driving style, vehicle feature usage, and external environment factors. If the efficiency of the driving thereafter was different, the range figure would adapt to accommodate that. The range figure stated on the dashboard when the battery was at 100% therefore may not have been the final mileage that was achieved on the battery cycle.Kia told us that while the Niro EV had an independently confirmed WLTP ‘Combined’ range of 285 miles, some external reports had found that colder temperatures and inefficient driving styles could result in a lower range, and that applied to any battery-based electric vehicle. They also stated that in the summer months, when temperatures were warmer, several Kia EV drivers had achieved range figures above the stated WLTP figure of 285 miles (combined)." ;

It also stated that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise, and required that marketing communications did not mislead consumers about a product’s total environmental impact. The Code further required that absolute claims were supported by a high level of substantiation. The ad featured the claim “people & planet-friendly small group adventures since 1989”. We noted Intrepid Travel’s comments that they did not offer flights as part of their travel packages and that consumers would therefore understand that the claim was a narrow reference to their tour offering only. However, we considered that the claim was not qualified with that information. We considered that the presentation of the Giza Pyramids in Egypt within the ad, together with the claim “planet-friendly”, indicated that such tours were international and that it would be necessary to travel, in most cases by flying, to take part in their tours. We considered that this impression was further reinforced by the claim not referring specifically to the tours offered by Intrepid Travel, and considered that, in the absence of qualifying information, “adventures” was likely to be interpreted by consumers as referring to holidays as a whole, which would include flights to and from the destination country. We considered that the claim “people & planet-friendly small group adventures” was an absolute claim, which would be understood to mean that taking part in an Intrepid tour caused no environmental damage throughout its full life cycle. We therefore expected to see evidence which demonstrated that taking part in an Intrepid Travel tour, including the necessary travel to and from the destination location, caused no environmental damage over its full life cycle. We assessed the evidence provided by Intrepid Travel. Whilst we acknowledged that they took part in a number of environmental schemes alongside their carbon offsetting programme, we considered that those schemes did not specifically relate to the life cycle of a holiday with Intrepid Travel, and they had not been referred to in the ad. We looked at the initiatives and targets Intrepid said they were committed to delivering, for example the Seven Point Commitment Plan and their SBTi membership, but noted that many of those initiatives were targeted to deliver results years into the future. We therefore considered that they did not relate to the claim as it would be interpreted by consumers. We understood that Intrepid Travel were certified as carbon neutral regarding their business operations because they offset the carbon emissions generated during their tours, such as emissions related to accommodation, meals and transfers, by purchasing carbon credits. In any case, we understood that Intrepid Travel did not calculate all greenhouses gases produced by their consumers travelling to and from their tour locations, nor did their offsetting programme take account of those emissions. We therefore considered that their carbon offsetting did not take account of all emissions attributable to the way in which consumers would likely interpret the claim “planet-friendly adventures”. Because air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which made a substantial contribution to climate change, and those emissions were not accounted for by Intrepid Travel, we considered that the absolute claim “people & planet-friendly adventures” had not been adequately substantiated. Because the basis of the claim had not been made clear and we had not seen evidence based on the full life cycle of the product to support the absolute claim “people & planet-friendly small group adventures” as it would be understood by consumers, we concluded the ad had misleadingly minimised the impact of Intrepid Travel’s holidays. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), and 11.1, 11.3 and 11.4 (Environmental claims)." ;

They further highlighted that the claim sufficiently conveyed the limits of the life cycle through the use of “small group adventures since 1989”. They asserted that made it clear the claim was a narrow and direct reference to their small group tours and that the inclusion of the Giza pyramids, alongside two travellers, further implied that the ad was a reference to their Egypt tour. Accordingly, they considered the ad had not misrepresented the impact of international flights or their tours on the environment. Intrepid Travel also highlighted that the ad included a link to their website which could be accessed by consumers and contained qualifying information regarding their environmental credentials. They considered that information was accessible and transparent, which allowed consumers to make an informed purchasing decision. They stated that they were certified as carbon neutral by Climate Active for their business operations and services. They explained that to achieve that certification, all greenhouse gas emissions attributable to an Intrepid tour throughout its life cycle were measured and offset through carbon credits that they purchased. They detailed that greenhouse gas emissions which were measured comprised of tour marketing and advertising, booking and payment systems, tour information materials, tour transport (air, water, public and land), tour accommodation, tour activities, tour waste and tour meals. They also supplied a section from their website which detailed carbon offset projects they supported through the scheme. They re-iterated that they offset their annual emissions footprint in its entirety and that they had been carbon neutral since 2010.

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but challenging different carbon credit projects. The RMDLT Portel-Pará REDD Project or Rio Mandaquari REDD+ Project (Project 977), which is the object of the lawsuit, overlaps areas of the State Agro-Extractivist Settlement Projects (PEAEX) Deus é Fiel and Joana Peres II - Dorothy Stang. These PEAEXs are public lands whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 977 generates REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and increased forest carbon stocks), was certified by an international company and was established in 2009 to generate carbon credits for forty years. Companies and individuals are sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of the rural properties where it is located. The DPE-PA alleges irregularities in the property registrations that make up the enterprise, and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. In addition, the mayor of Portel issued a Public Utility Decree authorising its operation, which the DPE-PA argues is unconstitutional. It is emphasised that the project was implemented without a prior technical study. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, that they did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and public forest concessions and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. The plaintiff argues that the defendants' behaviour entails the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) suspension of Project 997 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 977 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel." ;

The first two of these claims referred specifically to the microbiome, rather than the skin more generally, as being “nourished” by the products, and the third referred to “nourishing” in a more general sense. The ASA noted that the products were a body wash and lotion; product types that consumers were likely to associate with having the function of cleansing and/or moisturising or keeping the skin in good condition. In that context we considered that consumers were likely to understand that the claim “Every baby is born with a unique microbiome, a living layer that protects its skin, nourish it with Baby Dove wash and lotion” to mean that the products had the properties of cleansing or moisturising skin, but that they also had specific additional protective benefits specifically stemming from their effect on the skin microbiome. We considered that consumers would understand that a product that was said to “nourish” the “living layer that protects the skin” would itself have a role in protecting the skin, by helping to keep the microbiome in an optimum state to protect the skin. The use of the word “prebiotic” further reinforced the impression that the products offered a unique benefit relating specifically to their impact on the skin microbiome, and beyond that of a standard moisturiser or cleanser. We considered that the ad made breakthrough claims that would require a high level of evidence to substantiate them. In order to support the claims as consumers were likely to understand them, we expected to see well-designed clinical testing, conducted on humans, which demonstrated that the products would have a protective effect on the skin directly as a result of their impact on the skin microbiome. We took expert advice on the evidence submitted by Unilever, the specific details of which they requested we treat as confidential. We first assessed the six in vitro tests. While we acknowledged that in vitro tests could be useful for research, they could not always be extrapolated to suggest any effects seen would be identical or even similar in vivo. Those studies assessed the effects of glycerol (an ingredient in the products) on the growth of two species of bacteria, and the effects of metabolites produced by those bacteria in the presence of glycerol. Unilever described “Species A” as a good and “Species B” as a bad species of bacteria. One of the tests also looked at the effect of a metabolite on a second species of “bad” bacteria. We understood that the microbiome was highly complex and, while the evidence gave a sense of some of the species of bacteria and how they might be influenced by glycerol, we did not consider that the evidence showed that the species of bacteria cited in those studies could always be easily categorised as “good” and “bad”, or that the relationship between them and any positive or negative outcomes was causal. We also had concerns about the extent, if any, to which tests on specific species of bacteria could legitimately be extrapolated to the whole microbiome. We understood, however, that the microbiome was the subject of ongoing research which might provide more clarity on some of those questions in future. We understood that a product containing glycerol could be expected to provide moisturising benefits to the skin. However, we had not seen any evidence that glycerol would have an effect on the skin microbiome that would lead to a protective benefit on babies’ skin. Notwithstanding the details of the individual in vitro studies discussed above, we considered that they were insufficient to support the claims as consumers were likely to understand them: that the advertised product would have a protective benefit for the skin; or indeed, that it would have any effect on the condition of the skin, whether positive or negative. Unilever submitted details of four in vivo studies. The first was conducted on adult human skin and involved the application of different concentrations of glycerol to the forearm for two days and the changes in lactic acid on the skin was measured. The study reported that lactic acid levels increased in a dose-dependent manner. The experiment tested the effect of a single ingredient in the products, rather than the products themselves, and did not examine the effect of glycerol on microorganisms on the skin of human subjects. The sample size was very small. Furthermore, it was not tested on the group for which the product was intended (i.e., babies) and did not measure effects for longer than three days. We considered that the relevance of the findings supporting the claims made in the ad was limited. Another study examined the effect of a lotion containing glycerol on adult subjects with dry skin. It reported a significant increase in the “good” bacteria species and that there was no increase in “bad” bacteria species, compared to the control group. A further study on adult female subjects with dry skin assessed the effect of cleansing products on endpoints including the skin microbiome. We understood that dry adult skin was not an acceptable model for evaluating the product’s effect on the microbiome of normal, non-dry baby skin. A two-week parallel-design study of healthy infants evaluated the effects of washing with Baby Dove cleanser versus water alone. It reported no significant impact of the product on the skin microbiome. The subjects were the most relevant to the intended target audience of the products, compared to those used in the other in vivo tests. However, no endpoints relating to actual benefits for skin condition were presented. We considered that the body of evidence submitted by Unilever was insufficient to substantiate the claims in the ad as consumers were likely to understand them, namely that the products would have a protective effect on babies’ skin directly as a result of their impact on the skin microbiome. We concluded that the ad was misleading and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

Unilever said that the post advertised a baby wash and baby lotion, the primary purpose of which was to clean and moisturise a baby’s skin and keep it in good condition. They said the claims did not state or imply that the products could be used with a view to making a medical diagnosis or could treat or prevent disease, including injury, ailment or adverse condition. Instead, the claims made highlighted that the products could help support and protect skin and its microbiome, an intrinsic part of the skin surface and component of the skin and keep it in good condition, which were both functions of cosmetic products as defined in the European Cosmetics Regulation ((EC) No. 1223/2009). The ad was designed to highlight that skin had a unique microbiome which helped to protect it, and that Baby Dove head to toe wash and lotion could help care for the skin, which included the microbiome. Unilever said the claim “to nourish” was widely used in cosmetics. For example, in skin care and skin cleansing, where a moisturising product contained nourishing ingredients such as lipids, those ingredients helped to support skin function by moisturisation, which help to maintain skin in good condition. In hair care, the word “nourish” was used to describe the appearance and manageability of the hair after use of the product. The average consumer was therefore likely to understand the word “nourish” in the cosmetic sphere to mean to provide with the care and support that was needed to keep in good condition. Therefore their likely take-away from the ad would be that the products supported and cared for and kept the skin and its microbiome in good condition. They stated that the cleanser was intended to respect the microbiome, while the lotion nourished it, and that this was reflected in their test results. Unilever said that the role of the skin microbiome in protecting the skin and keeping it in good condition had been researched for over 16 years. Microbiome referred to the community of microorganisms that shared a human’s body space. A range of internal and external factors could affect the composition of the population of resident microbes, resulting in a microbiome that was unique to each person. Skin microbiome formed a key part of the skin barrier, fulfilling an essential role in maintaining healthy skin through the production of fatty acids and maintenance of pH. Disruptions in the balance of the microbiome had been associated with skin that was not in good condition.

He argued their activities amount to torts of public nuisance, negligence, and a novel climate duty. Smith further argued that these emissions affect him personally. As a Māori leader with an interest in customary land, Smith argued that the defendants’ actions would harm him through impacts related to rising sea levels, loss of sites of cultural and spiritual significance, damage to fisheries, and adverse health impacts. Smith asked the Court to issue declarations against the defendants, and to require them to reduce emissions. Notably, Smith did not seek damages.
Two of Smith’s arguments were struck out by the trial court, though the third claim – the novel climate duty – was allowed to go to trial. New Zealand’s Court of Appeal, however, struck out all three claims, meaning that Smith would not receive his day in court. In this most recent ruling, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed that decision. All three of Smith’s claims will now proceed to what may the be first full climate tort claim in a common law jurisdiction.
In February 2024, the Supreme Court released its strike out decision. Rather than ruling on the merits of Smith’s argument, the Court considered whether the claims should be struck out before the even reached trial. Under New Zealand law, such arguments should be struck out only if they “disclose[] no reasonably arguable cause of action”. This is a high threshold, and that surviving a strikeout challenge is no guarantee of success at trial. The decision is ultimately about whether Smith’s main claim in public nuisance amounts to a “reasonably arguable cause of action”. The Court clarified that a person is liable in public nuisance where they either (a) do an act not warranted by law, or (b) omit to discharge a legal duty; and further, where “the effect of the action or omission is to endanger the life, health, property or comfort of the public or to obstruct the public in the exercise or enjoyment of rights common to all Her Majesty’s subjects”.  In other words, a public nuisance is something which endangers public interests, or public rights.
First, the Court analyzed whether Smith had plausibly identified public rights which were being interfered with. The Court found that he had – the impacts of climate change would indeed engage rights which fit within the categories identified in existing case law. Secondly, the Court affirmed the appellate court’s finding that public nuisance need not involve otherwise illegal activity. In other words, the fact that the defendants’ GHG emissions were not illegal was not a basis for striking out the claim. Third, the court considered the “special damage” rule. This is a standing rule which requires that public nuisance claims only be brought by plaintiffs who are harmed in a way that is different from the general public. The Court queried whether this rule should remain part of the law; and even if it did, Smith’s material and cultural interests as a Māori coastal landowner were at least plausibly “special” enough to meet the rule’s requirements.
Finally, the Court considered of causation. Demonstrating a specific causal chain between a defendant’s emissions and the plaintiff’s harms is extremely challenging. No single emitter is the cause of any person’s harm. Instead, any emitter’s GHG emissions mix with emissions of millions of others, contributing to a global problem. How does one differentiate the defendants’ actions from those of any other, particularly given New Zealand’s globally small (though per capita large) contribution to GHG emissions?
The Court found that Smith had done enough for these questions to proceed to trial. Importantly, the Supreme Court found that the causation problems presented by Smith’s claims were fundamentally similar to other public nuisances involving multiple contributors, such as Industrial Revolution-era air and water pollution cases. “Climate change”, the Court concluded, “engages comparable complexities, albeit at a quantum leap scale of enlargement”. “Cumulative causation” problems presented by climate change should at least receive “evidence and policy analysis”, and should proceed to a full trial: “the common law must develop, if at all, in the fertile fields of trial, not on the barren rocks of a strike out application”.
Having found that Smith had done enough to show a reasonable public nuisance case, the Court permitted the two remaining causes of action – negligence and the proposed novel duty – to also progress to trial. The Court also rejected arguments that the common law claims were displaced by New Zealand’s statutory regime for climate torts.""" ;

ArrDee was then shown in a distillery, standing at a table with a selection of scientific flasks and measuring jugs, working on a formula. ArrDee was shown mixing liquids, making notes, and testing the results until he was happy. The video then cut to a display of 4Realli bottles, before cutting back to the nightclub, where the barman poured ArrDee a 4Realli, mixed with cola. As ArrDee tried the drink, a jump cut shifted the scene from the quiet, empty club, to seeing it filled with people and loud music, as ArrDee danced away from the camera to join friends on the dancefloor.

Upheld The CAP Code stated that people shown drinking alcohol or playing a significant role in a marketing communication for alcohol must neither be, nor seem to be, under 25 years of age. The ASA understood that ArrDee was 20 years old at the time the ads appeared. We considered that because he was the main focus of the images in ads (a) and (b), and was seen creating the product in the video in ad (c), he played a significant role in all three ads. We also noted that he was shown consuming alcohol in ad (c). We therefore concluded the ads were in breach of the Code. On that point, ads (a), (b) and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 18.16 (Alcohol). 2. Upheld Ad (c) featured shots of ArrDee trying a series of different, apparently unsatisfactory alcoholic drinks in a nightclub environment, before creating his own blend of spiced rum in a distillery, then drinking it in the nightclub, and joining a larger crowd in what had become a party atmosphere, before the phrase “#GETLIT” was shown on screen. We understood that the word “lit” had a long history of being used as a slang term for being drunk, and that it had also become popular within the rap music scene to indicate being intoxicated. We noted that in recent years the term “lit” had also been used in rap music to mean that something was exciting, or of an excellent quality. However, because the ad was focused on the creation and consumption of an alcoholic drink, and was set in a nightclub and a distillery, we considered that consumers would likely associate the phrase “#GETLIT”, in the context of ad (c), to relate to the consumption of alcohol, and becoming intoxicated. We therefore considered that the ad was likely to encourage excessive consumption of alcohol. While we welcomed Litty Liquor’s removal of the ad, we concluded that the ad was irresponsible because it encouraged excessive drinking, and breached the Code. On that point, ad (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 18.1 (Alcohol)." ;

The MPF alleges that the defendant's occupation of the land was illegal because it was part of an Agro-Extractivist Settlement Project (PAE), owned and managed by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and occupied by traditional extractivist communities. This ACP is part of a set of 22 lawsuits filed by the MPF as a result of the investigation carried out in Civil Inquiry No. 1.13.000.001719/2015-49 into illegal deforestation carried out inside the Antimary Agro-Extractivist Settlement Project (PAE) but against different defendants. The lawsuit is based, among other things, on Brazilian environmental law concerning the constitutional protection of the environment, the accusation of deforestation, propter rem civil liability for environmental damage, including climate damage, and collective moral damages. It also mentions the unauthorized emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) caused by the illegal deforestation of the area, calculated at 78,938.61 tons of carbon dioxide and which are directly related to the Brazilian State's departure from its climate goals, out of step with national and international commitments made by Brazil in the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009) and in the Paris Agreement (promulgated by Federal Decree 9.073/2017).

Upheld According to Regulation (EC) 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods (the Regulation), which was reflected in the CAP Code, only health claims listed as authorised on the EU Register of nutrition and health claims (the EU Register) could be made in ads promoting foods. From 1 January 2021, only health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register) were permitted. Health claims were defined as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food, or ingredient, and health. The ASA understood that the function of skin was to provide a permeable barrier against the external environment. We considered that claims which stated or implied a beneficial physiological effect on or change to the structure of the skin to aid in its function of providing a barrier were health claims for the purposes of the Regulation. In contrast, claims which related to improvements in appearance or maintenance of normal appearance of the skin did not refer to a beneficial physiological effect on a specific function of skin and therefore were cosmetic claims, rather than health claims. The Regulation therefore did not apply to cosmetic claims. We considered that assessing whether claims were health claims or cosmetic claims required an assessment of the specific claims made and the overall context of the ad. We considered the claim “Her skin has become more […] hydrated” would be understood by consumers to mean that using the product would make their skin more hydrated, and therefore that it would have a beneficial effect on a function of the skin, in particular by protecting the skin against dehydration which aided in its function of providing a barrier. We therefore considered that the claim “Her skin has become more […] hydrated” was a specific health claim for the purposes of the Code. Only specific health claims that were authorised on the GB Register were permitted under the Code, but we had not seen evidence that the claim was authorised on the GB Register. Because the claim “Her skin has become more […] hydrated” was a specific health claim which was not authorised, it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules15.115.1Marketing communications that contain nutrition or health claims must be supported by documentary evidence to show they meet the conditions of use associated with the relevant claim, as specified in the EU Register. Claims must be presented clearly and without exaggeration.15.1.115.1.1Only nutrition claims listed in the updated Annex of the EU Regulation (as reproduced in the EU Register) may be used in marketing communications.http://www.ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/claims/community_register/nutrition_claims_en.htmOnly health claims listed as authorised in the EU Register, or claims that would have the same meaning to the consumer may be used in marketing communications.http://www.ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/claims/community_register/authorised_health_claims_en.htm.(Foods, food supplements and associated health and nutrition claims) and15.715.7Nutrition and health claims for food supplements must be permitted or authorised as provided for at rule15.115.1Marketing communications that contain nutrition or health claims must be supported by documentary evidence to show they meet the conditions of use associated with the relevant claim, as specified in the EU Register. Claims must be presented clearly and without exaggeration.1 above. Marketing communications that contain nutrition or health claims must be supported by documentary evidence to show they meet the conditions of use associated with the relevant claim as specified in the EU Register.(Foods, food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). 2. Upheld The claims “lines and wrinkles have drastically reduced” and “more plump” were presented alongside a ‘before’ and ‘after’ image which showed noticeably brighter and less wrinkled skin. The claims were also preceded with the text “How beautiful does Gaynor look after just 12 weeks using Revive Collagen”. We considered that consumers would understand the claims to mean that using Revive Collagen would improve the cosmetic appearance of the skin, rather than claims that there would be a beneficial physiological effect or change to the structure of the skin to aid in its function of providing a barrier. We considered that the claim “her skin tone has improved”, and the generally brighter and more even skin tone shown in the ‘after’ photo, referred to the general appearance of the model’s skin, and therefore did not refer to a beneficial physiological effect of the product on the skin. We therefore need to see evidence that the product was effective in reducing lines and wrinkles, making the skin plumper, and improving skin tone. We considered that consumers would understand the claims, taken alongside the ‘before’ and ‘after’ image and the claims “Look at how beautiful Gaynor looks” and “change your skin forever” to mean that sustained use of the product over a period of time would results in a continued cosmetic improvement in the appearance of their skin. We acknowledged that the claims were from a testimonial, which Revive Collagen had provided evidence was genuine. However, we considered that a testimonial was not adequate as evidence to substantiate the claims. We needed to see evidence that demonstrated the efficacy of the product including scientifically robust studies. In the absence of such evidence, we concluded that the claims had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation) and12.112.1Objective claims must be backed by evidence, if relevant consisting of trials conducted on people. Substantiation will be assessed on the basis of the available scientific knowledge.Medicinal or medical claims and indications may be made for a medicinal product that is licensed by the MHRA, VMD or under the auspices of the EMA, or for a CE-marked medical device. A medicinal claim is a claim that a product or its constituent(s) can be used with a view to making a medical diagnosis or can treat or prevent disease, including an injury, ailment or adverse condition, whether of body or mind, in human beings.Secondary medicinal claims made for cosmetic products as defined in the appropriate European legislation must be backed by evidence. These are limited to any preventative action of the product and may not include claims to treat disease.(Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products)." ;

The plaintiffs argued that the operation of the Sendai Power Station violated (i) their personal rights to life, health, and bodily integrity (Jinkaku-ken) due to the health damage caused by the emission of environmental pollutants, (ii) their personal rights to life, health, and bodily integrity due to climate change, and (iii) the right to maintain biodiversity due to the emission of hazardous substances. Firstly, the plaintiffs argued that the emissions of pollutants, such as SOx and NOx, caused significant health damage by increasing the risks of various illnesses. Secondly, the plaintiffs argued that their personal rights were violated as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would worsen climate change, which causes extreme events, such as heat waves and heavy rains. To support this argument, they stated that the current use of coal-fired power plants was incompatible with the GHG emissions reduction targets in Japan and was also an obstacle to the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. Thirdly, the plaintiffs claimed that environmental rights, including the right to maintain biodiversity, should be recognized based on Article 13 of the Constitution." ;

                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society.The ad depicted a young woman sitting on a couch, lighting a cigarette, with an open can of lager on the table in front of her. The lighter was ignited, with the flame visible as she lit her cigarette. The ASA considered that consumers viewing the image would immediately be drawn to the fact that the model was in the process of lighting the cigarette and this was reinforced by the flame of her lighter, which caught the eye. While the image had been part of a series of photos in a campaign for the clothing line the “Gear Pullover”, we did not consider that the wider context of the campaign, or the intention to tell a story and invoke nostalgia through the image, would have been immediately apparent to someone viewing the ad. We considered that the image was heavily stylised, and had portrayed the model in a fashionable and attractive light. By linking such an image to the act of smoking, we considered the ad had the inherent effect of presenting smoking in an appealing manner and, as such, irresponsibly glamorised it. While we welcomed Sisters & Seekers’ willingness to remove the image from their website, we concluded that the ad was irresponsible, and therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social Responsibility). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that people shown drinking alcohol or playing a significant role in a marketing communication for alcohol must neither be, nor seem to be, under 25 years of age. While we acknowledged that the ad did not relate to the sale of an alcoholic product, the Code stated that the rule also applied to marketing communications which featured or referred to alcoholic drinks. We considered that the model was youthful in appearance, and that was accentuated by the casual style of loungewear she was wearing, as well as the way in which she had been styled with minimal make-up. We acknowledged Sisters & Seekers’ comments that they believed the can of lager would be assumed by viewers of the image to belong to the male model, who was partially in shot to the right of the image. However, we did not consider that the placement of the lager, on a small, shared table, necessarily suggested it was his drink. Nor did we consider that he was the focal point of the image, or that he would immediately be seen by viewers, because only his legs and hands were visible, and were at the edge of the shot. We therefore considered it was likely that viewers would assume, upon first seeing the image, that the lager belonged to the female model, whether she was depicted drinking from the can or not. We also considered that while the can of lager was not the focal point of the ad, it was a notable aspect, placed prominently in the foreground of the image, and added to the overall tone and visual impact of the ad. Because the ad featured a model who appeared to be under the age of 25 in a situation in which alcohol played a significant role in the setting and styling of the image, we concluded that the ad breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 18.16 (Alcohol)." ;

Sisters & Seekers Ltd said that while the ad contained an image of a model lighting a cigarette, along with a visibly open can of lager, they thought the ad had been prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and society, and had complied with the CAP Code. They also said they did not believe that the ad glamorised smoking or drinking alcohol. The ad had been part of a wider campaign which had been centred around storytelling, intended to convey the feeling of someone spending a weekend in their hometown with nothing to do. Sisters & Seekers said that the campaign’s aim had been to depict a creative portrayal of a working-class persona, and experience, informed by the experiences of members of their own creative team. The cigarette and alcohol had been props in support of that narrative, meant to invoke the nostalgia associated with old family photographs, rather than to be the focus of the image. The model had been depicted smoking because it was more commonplace and socially acceptable to smoke in the past. They believed the imagery and setting of the ad, that of an old static caravan, helped reinforce that sense of nostalgia, and said that the intention had been to portray someone from that generation trying a cigarette for the first time. Sisters & Seekers said that despite their belief that the ad had not glamorised smoking they had removed it from their website, to ensure viewers of the ad were not confused or distressed by it, regardless of the intention behind the image. 2. Sisters & Seekers said that while the can featured in the ad was likely to be identified as lager, they thought it had not played a significant role in the ad and had merely been a prop to signify that the location was a home environment. They highlighted that the model had not been depicted drinking in the ad. They also believed viewers of the ad would consider that the lager belonged to the male model who was partially visible at the edge of the image, because the can was closer to his side of the table, and because they thought that lager was traditionally a male drink." ;

One section of text stated, “Making electric easy. …Three charging options offer flexibility – use rapid public charging to reach 80% charge in around 30 minutes* with a 150 kW fast-charging system, charge through a fast charging wallbox which can be installed at home, or plug into a socket at home”. Further down the page in a section headed “Rapid charging” text stated, “You can easily find rapid charging points in a number of public locations. These highly efficient units are able to recharge 80% of your Toyota bZ4X batter in approximately 30 minutes*”. The *asterisk linked to text further down the page which stated, “*Charging times subject to local circumstance. Rapid charging power ratings can vary by location”. Further down the page was an FAQ section that included the text, “How long does charging take? Vehicle charging time depends on the power supply. At rapid public charge points, you can charge in as little as 30 mins. Wallbox charging takes between 6.5 to 10 hours^”." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would interpret the claim “use rapid public charging to reach 80% charge in around 30 minutes with a 150 kW fast-charging system” in the ad to mean that the Toyota bZ4X would always achieve a battery charge from 0% to 80% in around 30 minutes when using a 150 kW charger. We noted that the claim was linked to text further down the page that stated, “Charging times subject to local circumstance”. However, we considered it was unclear what “local circumstance” meant and how it was likely to impact on battery charging times. We acknowledged that the evidence provided by Toyota showed that, under standardised testing conditions (with a new battery and in a temperature-controlled environment with an ambient temperature of around 25 degrees centigrade) the battery could be charged from 0% to 80% in 30 minutes and 13 seconds using a 150 kW charger. However, we understood that various real-world factors such as battery temperature, ambient temperature and age and condition of the battery, might affect the time it would take for a battery to charge to 80%. If any of those conditions were less than optimal, then charging times would likely take longer than 30 minutes. We understood that the car had technology that was designed to maintain battery temperature at the most efficient level during vehicle usage and charging, which helped to support the battery charge time in varying weather conditions. However, battery temperature was one of several factors that could influence charging time. We would therefore expect Toyota to qualify the charging claim with an explanation of the conditions under which the figures were achieved and that they may not reflect actual consumer experience. We considered that a further limitation that was likely to affect whether consumers were able to achieve the claimed charging time was the availability of 150 kW chargers. We considered that the average consumer may not have an awareness of the speed or availability of a 150 kW charger in comparison to other chargers, although we acknowledged that consumers interested in purchasing an electric vehicle would be likely to have some awareness that they may need to travel to access the network of rapid charging points. We noted that the ad described the 150 kW charger as a “fast-charging system” that would provide “rapid public charging” and stated that alternative options were “a fast-charging wallbox” that could be installed at home or by plugging into a socket at home. Text further down the page stated, “You can easily find rapid charging points in a number of public locations. These highly efficient units are able to charge 80% of your Toyota bz4X battery in approximately 30 minutes*”. The sub-heading to the text containing the claim stated, “Making electric easy”. Taking into account those references to ease and public locations, and in the absence of any specific limitations in the ad stating otherwise, we considered that the average consumer was likely to form the impression that it was relatively straightforward to access 150 kW chargers throughout the UK in public places. We considered that the text “Rapid charging power ratings can vary by location” was insufficient to make clear that the provision of 150 kW chargers varied across the UK and was not available in Northern Ireland. We concluded that because the ad omitted material information about the factors that could significantly affect the advertised charging time and the limitations in relation to the availability of 150 kW chargers in Northern Ireland and across the UK, the claim “use rapid public charging to reach 80% charge in around 30 minutes with a 150 kW fast-charging system” had not been substantiated and was misleading.

They said the electrified vehicle market in the UK was expanding at a rapid rate but, while hybrid and battery electric vehicles were now familiar on British roads, there were still barriers to adoption by consumers. They understood one of these factors to be consumer concerns about charging. Toyota said they wished to help consumers make a more informed choice, and that the claim that was the subject of the complaint was intended to alert consumers to the advances in battery and charging technology. They said the new generation of ‘fast’, ‘rapid’ and ‘ultra-rapid’ chargers had led to much faster charging times. They said that the bZ4X model had a maximum charging power of 150 kW and therefore was able to draw the maximum power that a 150 kW ultra-rapid charger could deliver. They believed that it was essential that manufacturers retained the right to inform consumers where an electric car was able to maximise the benefits of 150 kW charging to enable consumers to make comparisons between vehicles. Consumers could then draw conclusions as to how relevant the continuing roll-out of ultra-rapid charging infrastructure would be to a specific electric vehicle, before ordering one. Toyota said the ad explicitly stated the claim related to using a 150 kW fast charging system, and they said they used conservative, rather than absolute language when stating it would achieve a 80% charge “in around 30 minutes”. They said the claim was caveated, with a prominent footnote informing consumers that the charging times were subject to local circumstance and that rapid charging power ratings could vary by location. They believed that this conveyed to the average consumer that their local circumstances might affect their individual charging time and so the charge time in particular circumstances might differ from that stated on the website. They said the ad also set out the \"fast-charging system\" in the context of other charging options such as a home wall box and plugging into a socket at home. They provided a document showing the results of real-world testing of the battery done in November 2021, which included total charge time and a graph showing the charging curve. They said they accepted there were variables that could impact on charging times, and that charging times may be longer than normal in very hot or very cold temperatures, where that affected the temperature of the battery. They explained that the bZ4X was fitted with battery heating and cooling technology as standard. The technology was designed to maintain battery temperature at the most efficient level during vehicle usage and charging, and that helped to support the battery charge time in varying weather conditions. They had still qualified the claim to make it clear that charging times were “subject to individual circumstance”. They said the ad had appeared six months before the bZ4X was available in the UK and the claim was being made in relation to a vehicle that was available for pre-order only. The average consumer would have understood the ad in that context, namely, that the car was designed to have the advertised charging capability, but that figure was based on test data obtained before the vehicle had appeared on UK roads, and that the claim also related to the vehicle when new. They added that additional technology within the car maintained battery life, helping to minimise the impact of battery age/condition on charge time. Toyota considered that the average consumer (particularly the average consumer contemplating an electric vehicle purchase) would be aware, including from the additional context provided by the ad and the associated footnotes, that references to fast 150 kW charging systems indicated higher speed charging compared to home charging or public charging. They believed consumers would also know that not all charging units were rated 150 kW and that they would need to travel to access the relevant units. They said consumers would understand that 150 kW charging was not optimal in all circumstances, since it would be more convenient and better value to charge at home, when time was not an issue. Drivers would mainly require 150 kW charging when they were in transit on longer journeys, as they would not want to spend significant time at service stations waiting for the battery to charge before resuming their journey. Toyota said that, at the time the ad appeared, Zap Map, a website showing where EV charging points could be found, indicated there were 419 charging points at 134 locations in the UK. Of those, 30 points at seven locations were in Scotland and nine points at two locations were in Wales. They said that it was more relevant to consider the numbers of charging points in October 2022 because that was the time the bZ4X first appeared on UK roads; it had only been available to order in March 2022. In October 2022 there were 946 charging points at 243 locations in the UK, of which 57 points at 14 locations were in Scotland and 31 points at six locations were in Wales, although a map showing the precise location of 150 kW charging points was not available. They considered the ad was therefore unlikely to mislead on the basis of charger availability, given the reference to different charging options in the ad. They noted that there were currently no charging units offering a 150 kW+ power rating in Northern Ireland and said they would make this clear when using claims similar claims in future. Toyota stated that availability of 150 kW+ charging systems was continually increasing and at a rapid rate, so drivers would have even more options during 2022 and 2023 and beyond. They said they understood that 150 kW+ chargers were available in multiple locations across the UK, including in major population centres and major travel points on motorways or major arterial roads, and they believed it was those areas where drivers were most likely to need them. They said they understood that ultra-rapid 150 kW charging was less likely to be the most suitable option for drivers making short journeys in urban or extra-urban locations as those drivers would rarely need to charge up to 80%, fast, to complete their journey. Instead, a lesser 'top-up', delivered as quickly by a less powerful public charger was likely to be sufficient." ;

Below that text included “There are also substantial quantities of silver and copper, metals which will be critical to enable the building of a renewable energy industry”. Next to that, under the subheading “This project in numbers”, the ad included “100% carbon neutral from day one. The mine will not contribute to climate change”." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1. Not upheld The ad stated that “You can view our planning application at planningni.gov.uk” and “It describes how we intend to build an underground mine committed to environmental responsibility”. The ASA therefore considered it was clear that the ad referred to a proposed project. In that context, we considered the claim “100% carbon neutral from day one. The mine will not contribute to climate change”, would be understood as a reference to the mine’s carbon neutral credentials. We considered the references to “from day one” and “the mine will not contribute to climate change” would be understood as references to the lifespan of the mine and full lifecycle of emissions, taking into account direct and indirect emissions, meaning that emissions from the very outset would be taken account of in the measures taken to ensure the mine was carbon neutral. We understood the complainant was concerned that the ad was misleading because Dalradian Gold had an existing operation in the area and because it implied that the mine would produce zero carbon emissions that had not already been offset. However, we considered the ad clearly referred to a future proposed mine, where its full lifecycle would begin at the point its construction commenced. We also considered the audience would understand that in the immediate term, day-to-day operations from the mine would produce carbon, but that over the mine’s lifecycle, a method was in place to offset those emissions. We understood that the established practice for carbon neutrality in those circumstances involved achieving zero net emissions associated with the project through calculating post-emission the direct and indirect emissions, reducing emissions and offsetting residual emissions. Given the project planning application had yet to receive approval at the time of publication, we considered they would need to demonstrate a credible plan for how that would be put into practice in future. We understood that Dalradian Gold’s planning proposal included a statement which explained their willingness to commit to a legally binding obligation to operate the mine in a carbon neutral manner. The statement explained how that commitment extended across all stages of the mine’s lifecycle (including construction, operation and closure) and to take into account both direct and indirect emissions. It also established a commitment to enter into contract with a third party to ensure the delivery of carbon neutral status would be legally enforceable and independently verified. The established process to achieve best-practice carbon neutrality firstly required calculating carbon emissions. We understood Dalradian Gold intended to apply the Greenhouse Gas Protocol developed by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. We considered the calculation methodology behind that scheme was sound and robust, and we understood it could be applied to both the direct and indirect emissions associated with the mine. The next step in achieving best-practice carbon neutrality meant reducing carbon emissions. We considered the IEMA framework provided an established method which could be applied to that process. This encompassed avoiding, reducing, substituting and compensating for emissions. We understood that this framework could also encompass both direct and indirect emissions from the project. We noted that Dalradian Gold had already identified an opportunity to reduce their carbon emissions by substituting from fossil fuel to electrically powered technology, which was included in their planning application. Carbon neutrality further required calculating residual emissions, once emission reductions had been taken into account, and purchasing carbon credits to offset those residual emissions. That process should be done in a robust and verifiable manner. We understood Dalradian Gold planned to adhere to the framework set out by the British Standards Institution’s PAS2060 Specification for the Demonstration of Carbon Neutrality. Not only did that standard cover the previous two steps (carbon emission calculation and mitigation) but also set a standard for using certified carbon offsetting schemes. We understood Dalradian Gold intended to use the Gold Standard and Verified Carbon Standard credits which we considered compatible with a robust and verifiable offsetting system. Because we considered Dalradian Gold had demonstrated a credible plan for how the project would achieve carbon neutrality through its lifecycle, including direct and indirect emissions, in accordance with recognised national and international frameworks that governed calculations of carbon emissions and how to off-set them, we concluded the ad was not likely to mislead. On that point, we investigated the ad under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation),11.311.3Absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. Comparative claims such as \"greener\" or \"friendlier\" can be justified, for example, if the advertised product provides a total environmental benefit over that of the marketer's previous product or competitor products and the basis of the comparison is clear.and11.411.4Marketers must base environmental claims on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the marketing communication states otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle. If a general claim cannot be justified, a more limited claim about specific aspects of a product might be justifiable. Marketers must ensure claims that are based on only part of the advertised product's life cycle do not mislead consumers about the product's total environmental impact.(Environmental claims), but did not find it in breach. 2. Upheld We considered the claim “There are also substantial quantities of silver and copper, metals which will be critical to enable the building of a renewable energy industry” would be understood as an indication that a benefit of the proposed mine would be its extraction of a significant quantity of silver and copper, which would then be used in the renewable energy industry in Northern Ireland. However, Dalradian Gold did not provide us with evidence to prove that any quantity of silver and copper extracted from the proposed mine would be used in the renewable energy industry. In the absence of such evidence, we concluded the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising) and3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

Dalradian Gold Ltd said in November 2017 they had submitted a planning application to permit the building of an underground mine and associated infrastructure in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. At the time of writing the application for planning permission now rested with the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure (DfI). Dalradian Gold stated, as part of the planning process, its commitment to fulfil its carbon neutral objective. They said they had secured the services of an expert agency for advice on how the carbon footprint for the development proposals would be assessed and how any impact would then be offset. As part of the ongoing process, they said greenhouse gas (GHG) assessments would be undertaken on an annual basis should the project be agreed and these would provide a constant and consistent review of their commitment which would be placed into the public arena at the appropriate time. Dalradian Gold said the assessments would be completed by senior members of a third party. Assessment would be undertaken in accordance with relevant guidance so as to ensure completeness, accuracy and a high level of robustness. It would represent a lifecycle GHG assessment in that it would estimate emissions over the 30-year period scheduled for the development, comprised of three years of construction, 25 years of operation and two years of decommissioning – the whole lifecycle of the project. They said that carbon neutrality would apply to the project’s direct and indirect emissions, which would cover Scopes One, Two and Three of emissions as defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol developed by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Dalradian Gold said that for any GHG assessment they would initially explore all opportunities to mitigate GHG emissions on-site in accordance with the GHG Management Hierarchy. That would be done in accordance with the recommendation from the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment’s (IEMA) Special Report; GHG Management & Reporting (2010). The GHG Management Hierarchy sought the prioritisation of measures to ‘avoid’ then ‘reduce’ emissions at source, before identifying opportunities to ‘substitute’ and ‘compensate’ for residual or unavoidable emissions through, for example, the procurement of off-site renewable energy and high quality carbon offsets. Dalradian Gold believed the ad’s audience would be aware that offsetting carbon emissions was performed post-emission. They did not believe readers would take the phrasing of the claim in a literal way, such that they would expect carbon emissions would be offset immediately at the point of emission. Dalradian Gold said that such an interpretation would be unrealistic and contrary to established practices. Dalradian Gold said they were committed to pursuing opportunities for the on-site reduction of GHG emissions. Their planning application included an electrically-powered surface conveyor to move rock from the mine to the surface which would result in a significant reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions by reducing surface vehicle movements. Dalradian Gold said that to implement the carbon offsetting they would engage a leading provider of carbon neutral services including high quality carbon credits and renewable energy market instruments. In due course, the GHG assessment methodology and results would be shared with a chosen provider to enable a robust and credible carbon offset programme for residual (or unavoidable) GHG emissions across the project lifecycle to be developed and costed out. Dalradian Gold said they endorsed expectations that companies that claim carbon neutrality should offset their carbon emissions in a robust and verifiable manner, and that they intended to be fully compliant in that respect. They said they had indicated to DfI that they would be willing to commit to a binding legal obligation to do so by way of a Planning Agreement, which was clearly stated in the Addendum to their Environmental Statement. Dalradian Gold said the chosen provider of carbon neutral services would support in the identification of a carbon emission reduction programme approach for the lifetime operations of the project, including: 100% renewable electricity from UK renewable energy projects using market instruments such as Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) and high quality carbon credits for residual direct and other indirect emissions such as Gold Standard and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) credits. They would look to utilise a blend of carbon offset packages, including those in both developing countries and those in the UK which accord with recognised standards such as the Woodland Carbon Code and Peatland Code. As part of their quality assurance process, annual GHG assessments undertaken for the project would be subject to third-party validation. That meant the amount of REGOs and carbon credits required would be scrutinised by an independent organisation. They believed that would provide a further level of validation and therefore a greater level of robustness. PAS2060 Specification for the Demonstration of Carbon Neutrality provided a framework for annual public reporting and associated declarations regarding carbon neutral status. That Publicly Available Specification (PAS) had been developed by the British Standards Institution (BSI) to specify requirements to be met by any entity which sought to demonstrate carbon neutrality through the quantification, reduction and offsetting of GHG emissions. Dalradian Gold stressed their commitment to the use of PAS2060 through construction, operation and decommissioning, which therefore provided an additional level of assurance and transparency on carbon neutrality. 2. Dalradian Gold said that the ad did not suggest, either expressly or impliedly, that all polymetallic materials mined would be used exclusively by the renewable energy industry in Northern Ireland or in the renewable energy industry as a whole. They believed the ad merely suggested that such metal would be critical in the building of such industry and they explained the necessity of copper and silver within the renewable energy industry. Dalradian Gold believed it was clear that the ad’s reference to a ‘new industry’ was a reference to the mining industry and the potential approval of that project. Dalradian Gold also believed the ad was clear through the sentence “Post approval, the mine will boost Northern Ireland’s economy and build prosperity for families and communities west of the Bann”, that it was the mine which would benefit the Northern Irish economy, rather than by implying that substantial quantities of silver and copper would be used to enable the building of a renewable energy industry in Northern Ireland. Dalradian Gold also believed the use of the word “also” in the claim “There are also substantial quantities of silver and copper, metals which will be critical to enable the building of a renewable energy industry” suggested that the silver and copper that was critical to the building of a renewable energy industry was in addition to the main intended message, which was the importance of the proposed mine itself." ;

While the ad did not refer to any specific benefits, it mentioned different types of muscle responses, and we considered that the overall impression of the ad was that the personalised information provided by DNAfit would help consumers improve their general health and fitness. We noted DNAfit offered a range of packages focused on, among other things, weight loss, and improving fitness and strength, and the provision of advice in the form of genetically-matched training programmes and personalised meal plans and recipes. Consumers received action points pertaining to the information received, and also the option of a complimentary phone call with an expert who could advise them further. We therefore considered, given the broad nature of the claim in the ad and the number of different packages on offer, that DNAfit should hold scientific evidence in support of the claimed link between DNA sequencing and effective personalised exercise and nutrition advice, and that evidence should measure tangible benefits related to fitness, for example weight loss or strength. We considered that DNAfit’s audience would likely consist of individuals with a range of fitness levels and goals, including those who were motivated to improve their health and fitness, and those who were already reasonably fit. DNAfit provided four relevant studies and a systematic review they said evidenced the effectiveness of implementing genetic information in diet programmes, termed ‘nutrigenetics’. They provided a paper of guidelines that could be used to evaluate scientific validity and evidence for nutrigenetic dietary advice. They also provided a number of studies that related to the functions of different SNPs which they believed demonstrated links between different genotypes and the nutrient and exercise requirements. Those informed the range of genes on which they did their testing. We noted the guidelines on evaluating scientific evidence for nutrigenetic dietary advice, which DNAfit said they used to inform their decisions about which genes to include in their testing. DNAfit said for each gene included in their tests, a minimum of three peer-reviewed studies using human subjects that showed an effect modifiable by an environment or lifestyle change was required. We reviewed the studies related to SNPs and how they related to the claim under investigation and understood DNAfit had provided them as a means of demonstrating the link between different genotypes used by DNAfit in their testing and consumers’ nutrient and exercise requirements. Some studies referred to links between disease risk and certain genotypes – for example, one study reported that men with the SOD2 Ala/Al genotype were more likely to have an increased risk of prostate cancer, and that increased consumption of selenium could mitigate this. We understood that randomised controlled trials were not necessarily the most appropriate methodology to measure incidence of disease, because of the length of time it would take to measure health outcomes in many cases. However, we considered that other indicators of improved health and fitness would be measurable in the shorter term, and DNAfit should therefore be able to demonstrate through relevant, controlled trials that personalised nutrigenetic advice resulted in improved outcomes in relation to such indicators. One study from 2007 related to the use of nutrigenetics in improving long-term weight loss. The study used a test group of 50 participants from a weight loss clinic who were given nutrigenetic diet advice, and a control group of 43 individuals from the same clinic who were advised to follow a standard low-glycaemic Mediterranean diet. Both groups were given exercise recommendations. The study found a significantly greater reduction in Body Mass Index (BMI) in the intervention group compared to the control group at 300 days. We noted that the results at 100 days reported no significant difference. We also noted there was also a significantly greater reduction in fasting blood glucose level in those at pre-diabetic levels, in favour of the intervention group. We considered that while the study suggested positive results, there were a number of key flaws. There was no blinding of the participants involved, and the difference between the groups could be explained by one group being motivated by having a personalised diet rather than the diet itself being objectively better. Additionally, dietary adherence was not described. A more recent study from 2017 examined whether the inclusion of genetic information to personalise a patient's diet could improve long-term weight management outcomes and used two groups, of 53 and 61 participants respectively, who self-selected either a ketogenic or a nutrigenetic diet. The self-selection indicated the study was not blinded, which in turn could have had an influence on the results and conclusions drawn. The study almost exclusively used obese participants ? with one participant in the overweight category. The study found a significant difference between the groups, after two years, in participants’ cholesterol and weight levels, compared to their weight and cholesterol levels at the beginning of the study. However, the authors stated it was uncertain whether that was due to biological mechanism or dietary adherence, so the reason for the significant difference between the two groups was unknown. Where dietary adherence was concerned, we noted that had not been assessed as part of the study, so it was unclear how well participants had adhered to the diet in both the test and follow-up periods. We considered the “control” diet would have placed a greater burden on participants, making them more likely to divert from it. Another, double-blind, study examined the effect of disclosing genetic data on its participants’ nutrient intake. The participants consisted of an intervention group of 92, who were provided with nutrigenetic advice, and a randomised control group of 46, who were given general dietary advice. We noted the nutrients subject to the study were caffeine, vitamin C, sodium, and added sugar. We noted the study found a significant decrease in sodium intake after 12 months in the intervention group, compared to the control group. The study was not designed to measure health outcomes, but looked at whether receiving personalised information made people more likely to comply with dietary advice. The systematic review looked at the existing literature on the use of genetic testing in lifestyle behaviour change. The review concluded that, while it was possible to facilitate behaviour change through the provision of genetic intervention, but because of the multifaceted nature of behaviour and behaviour change, the authors could not make any broad statement about the impact of nutrigenetic information on dietary behaviour change. We also noted the author of the review concluded that the majority of the studies were of low quality. DNAfit provided two studies they said evidenced the effectiveness of implementing genetic information in exercise programmes, termed “lifestyle genomics”. We noted both studies used small sample sizes – one of 28 and 29 athletes across two study groups, and the other 42. The participants were exclusively male, athletic and between 16 and 20 years of age. The first study gave a group of participants fitness advice that matched their genetics, and another group mismatched advice. Participants were blind to whether or not they were receiving genetic-matched advice. Each group was then assessed on its explosive power and aerobic fitness. The study found that the matched group significantly improved on both of those aspects, compared to the mismatched group among the footballers. The study concluded that further research using untrained and unfit participants was needed. We considered that the study showed some positive results, but was small in scale and did not account for potential confounding factors such as additional training the participants may have been doing at the time of the study. We also considered that without further robust results, a study of that size was unlikely to be sufficient to substantiate the claims in isolation. The second study divided a group of 42 football players into three groups – high, medium and low expected improvements in adaptation to aerobic exercise – based on genetic modelling. Participants were not blinded and there was no control group because the researchers felt it would be unethical to ask a control group of football players to refrain from training for the study. The study found a significant difference in post-training performance between the ‘high’ and ‘low’ groups. However, we noted that the study stated that further research with, among other things, female participants was needed. The study cited the small sample size used as being a limitation. We noted the study had been carried out by, among others, employees of DNAfit. We also noted the lack of a control group in the study and considered the researchers could have put the control group on a programme based on standard training, which would have mitigated the “ethical” concerns surrounding asking players to refrain from training completely. We welcomed DNAfit’s assurance that the ad was no longer appearing. However, overall, we considered that the body of evidence provided by DNAfit was not sufficient to substantiate the claim “Unlock the secret to your ideal diet, vitamin need and exercise response” as consumers were likely to understand it in the context of the ad. We concluded that the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

Substantiation will be assessed on the basis of the available scientific knowledge.Medicinal or medical claims and indications may be made for a medicinal product that is licensed by the MHRA, VMD or under the auspices of the EMA, or for a CE-marked medical device.

Firstly, the MoEF argued that the defendant did not have adequate preventive and control system as required in Indonesian forest protection regulation. Secondly, the MoEF found that PT National Sago Prima were running the business without the mandatory Environmental Impact Analysis (Analisis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan). Hence, the MoEF argued that the defendant had been negligent and therefore is liable for compensation for the damages.

The plaintiffs seek the suspension and subsequent annulment of the environmental licensing process of the Portocem Thermoelectric Plant (UTE), powered by natural gas, which is to be installed in the Pecém Industrial and Port Complex (CIPP). They claim there is non-compliance with legal norms and several omissions in the Environmental Impact Study (EIA), including (i) the concealment of indigenous communities in the vicinity of the project, (ii) the disregard of impacts related to water resources, (iii) the disregard of potential socioeconomic impacts, (iv) the underestimation of damage to health, and (v) the disregard of climate impacts. They also believe that there was no adequate analysis of synergistic and cumulative impacts with other enterprises in the region, considering their insertion in an Industrial Complex. In relation to climate impacts, the plaintiffs argue that the EIA failed to list important consequences for climate stability. They mention the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and how the use of fossil fuels is incompatible with the guiding principles of the national energy policy. They argue that Brazil and the state of Ceará have made a legal commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which goes against the implementation of a new gas-fired thermoelectric plant. The plaintiffs also point out that the Northeast is one of the regions in Brazil most vulnerable to climate change and stress the importance of the risk analysis of the project to the water security of the region, considering that the water resources of the Northeast are under pressure from climate change. On top of the problems in the impact assessment, the plaintiffs also state flaws in the licensing process due to the lack of effective public participation. In this sense, they question the lack of prior, free, and informed consultation with the indigenous Anacé people. They believe that there was a violation of national and international norms of indigenous peoples' rights, especially Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO)." ;

In November 2022, a paid-for Google ad for 4AIR was seen which stated, “Eco-Friendly Aviation – Future of Sustainable Aviation” and “Learn How To Turn Flying Into A Force For Good With A 4AIR Rating. Industry-Leading Standard For Sustainability In Private Aviation. Sustainability. Aviation Industry.”
The Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) challenged whether the ad gave a misleading impression of the environmental impact of the service.
By ruling of August 30, 2023, the ASA upheld the challenge.
The CAP Code required that absolute environmental claims be supported by a high level of substantiation.
The claims “Eco-Friendly Aviation”, “Sustainable Aviation” and “Turn Flying Into A Force For Good” would be understood by businesses to mean that 4AIR offered services that could ensure aviation operations did not cause environmental damage. Businesses would also understand from the claims that, by using 4AIR’s services, their business would be capable of having an immediate positive impact on the environment.
The ASA therefore expected to see a high level of evidence that substantiated the claims, taking into account the full life cycle of the products and services associated with 4AIR’s services. Given those services were directly linked with aviation, that that meant the full life cycle of aviation operations, even though 4AIR did not itself operate aircraft.
Aviation, even with the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, produced high levels of CO2 and non-CO2 emissions which contributed to climate change. Further, the results of research into future aircraft technologies would not be delivered until decades into the future. Support of such an initiative via 4AIR was not therefore adequate substantiation to evidence the claim “Turn Flying Into A Force For Good” as it would be understood in context.
Further, there were no initiatives or commercially viable technologies within the aviation industry which would adequately substantiate absolute claims such as “Eco-friendly Aviation” and “Sustainable Aviation” as businesses would interpret them in context.
The claims were therefore likely to mislead businesses in relation to 4AIR’s capability to ensure that aviation operations which purchased its services did not negatively impact the environment. The ad therefore breached the Code.
The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again in the form complained about. The ASA told 4AIR to ensure it did not mislead businesses by understating the environmental impact of their service, including by using absolute claims such as “Eco-Friendly Aviation”, “Sustainable Aviation”, and “Turn Flying Into A Force For Good”.
This Ruling formed part of a wider piece of work on climate change and the environment. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA’s Active Ad Monitoring system, which used AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules""" ;

The Belgian National Bank has participated in the European Central Bank's Corporate Sector Purchase Program (CSPP), in which six national central banks purchase bonds from eligible companies to improve financing conditions by lowering debt costs. ClientEarth alleges that over half of bonds purchased under the CSPP were issued by greenhouse-gas intensive sectors and that the program, therefore, exacerbates the climate crisis. ClientEarth alleges that the Belgian National Bank's participation in the CSPP, by not taking into account climate, environment, and human rights impacts, violated Article 11 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and Article 37 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (both concern the obligation to integrate environmental protection into EU policies). As part of its case, ClientEarth sought a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice to determine whether the decision to establish the CSPP was lawful; it argues that it was not because of the failure to take into account climate considerations in designing the CSPP as required by EU law, because the CSPP is itself inconsistent with EU climate policy, and become it undermines the European Union's emissions reduction targets." ;

Gambling ads could not therefore appeal more strongly to under-18s than they did to over-18s. The ASA understood that the ad was not seen in an age-gated environment and outside of that environment Ladbrokes had taken steps to target the ad only at those aged 18 years of age and over. However, we understood that targeting of the ad was based on an audience which had self-reported their age and where there were otherwise no prohibitions on under-18s. Therefore, the steps taken could not ensure that under-18s, who falsely reported their age, were not exposed to the ad. We therefore considered whether it complied with the Code’s requirement that gambling ads must not be of particular appeal to children. We understood that when it was initially released in 1985, “The Goonies” – which involved a pirate-themed treasure hunt, and featured a cast predominantly comprised of children – had been directed at, and would have particularly appealed to, audiences under the age of 18. We understood that since its release the film had become available on streaming services, but had not seen widespread re-release in cinemas. We also understood that the film had gained cult status, particularly among adults who were children when the film was originally released. We considered that because of that, it was not a recent or current film with which children were likely to be familiar. Nonetheless, we considered the content of the film was likely to have some appeal for them. However, given its popularity among adults, we did not consider that it was likely to appeal more to under-18s than over-18s. We noted that while the ad featured “The Goonies” logo and typeface, it did not feature any characters or other imagery from the film. We considered that the nautical map and golden doubloons featured in the ad were not colourful, cartoonish, or otherwise presented in a way that was likely to resonate with children, and were more likely to have general or adult appeal. We therefore concluded that the ad was not of particular appeal to under-18s and had not breached the Code. We investigated the ad under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules16.116.1Marketing communications for gambling must be socially responsible, with particular regard to the need to protect children, young persons and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or exploited.and16.3.1216.3.12be likely to be of particular appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture(Gambling) but did not find it in breach." ;

The action challenges Law 14.182/2021, which deals with the privatization of the national electricity company Eletrobras and promotes changes in the Brazilian electricity sector regime. The law derived from a provisional measure, which can only be adopted in exceptional circumstances. The plaintiffs argue that the provisional measure, which was then turned into the law in question, lacked the requirement of urgency, circumventing the regular legislative process. They claim that, when considering the conversion of the provisional measure, the National Congress approved amendments that resulted in substantial changes to Brazilian energy planning. The final wording of the provisions reveals an undue attempt to prevent a possible veto by the President of the Republic. The Law, under the terms approved, requires the mandatory contracting of energy from small hydroelectric power plants and natural gas thermoelectric plants. The plaintiffs argue that such a requirement makes the necessary decarbonization of the Brazilian energy matrix more distant and will lead to an increase in annual greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), in breach of the commitments made under the Paris Agreement and by the President of the Republic at COP26. The plaintiffs point out that the enactment of the Law violates the legal and constitutional order since it is contrary to the duty to act in favor of the protection of intact and stable climatic conditions. The Law also authorizes the Federal Union to start the construction of the Linhão de Tucuruí (transmission line), disregarding the administrative processes of environmental permitting and consultation and affecting indigenous groups." ;

Disagreeing with the Higher Regional Court of Schleswig, the Court held that advertising of a company or a product as climate neutral may have a significant influence on a purchase decision. It further stated that the term 'climate neutral' had a clear meaning - in contrast to the Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main which had stated the opposite and held that it could be mixed up with the term 'emission free'. The Court elaborated that average consumers understood climate neutrality in the sense of a 'balanced balance sheet'. Furthermore, it held that climate neutrality could be reached through emission reduction as well as compensation measures. Consumers had to know whether climate neutrality concerned the whole company and/or certain products. But because emission trading and other compensation measures generally were under the suspicion of greenwashing, consumers had a significant interest regarding the information of the measures taken on behalf of the company in order to reach the alleged climate neutrality." ;

The TV ad showed a car driving and emitting exhaust smoke. A pedestrian was shown coughing. The voiceover said, “London has an urgent air quality problem and it is impacting the health of Londoners. So to help clear the city’s air the Ultra Low Emission Zone is expanding across all London boroughs from the 29th August this year … Because every journey matters.” A bird was shown flying and people were running and participating in other activities in the city. b. The first radio ad said, “Drivers we need you to check your vehicles because the Ultra Low Emission Zone is expanding across all London boroughs from the 29th August this year, to help clear London’s air and improve health for you, your family and every Londoner … To the Mayor of London and TfL every journey matters.” c. The second radio ad said, “Poor air quality is affecting the health of Londoners. I’m Sarah Woolnough, I am the chief executive of Asthma and Lung UK. Road traffic is a major source of air pollution in London. We are passionate about improving the air we breathe. To improve London’s air we are really supportive of the expanded ULEZ. The Central London ULEZ has shown you can reduce air pollution, we have seen almost a halving of levels of nitrogen dioxide. To help clear London’s air and improve health the Ultra Low Emission Zone is expanding across all London boroughs from 29th August this year …” d. The third radio ad stated, “Did you know that most air pollution related deaths actually occur in Outer London areas?”, “Oh wow, no, I didn't know that. It's higher than in Central London?”, “It’s obviously a concern, considering our parents are more vulnerable”, “That's why the Ultra Low Emission Zone is expanding across all London boroughs from the 29th of August this year to help make the air clearer.” e. The fourth radio ad stated, “Poor air quality is affecting the health of Londoners.” “Recent reports have shown a link between air pollution and an increased risk of developing dementia. We believe risk factors, such as air pollution, account for 40 per cent of dementia cases, many of which could be avoided. With almost one million people living with dementia in the UK – reducing our risk is extremely important. It’s really encouraging to see the ambition at a local level to reduce air pollution and help reduce the risk of developing dementia.” “To help clear London’s air and improve health the Ultra Low Emission Zone is expanding across all London boroughs from 29th August this year.” f. The press ad seen in the Metro stated, “London has an urgent air quality problem. That is why the ULEZ is expanding across all London boroughs from 29 August 2023 … The ULEZ has already made a significant difference by helping to reduce harmful nitrogen dioxide pollution by nearly half in Central London.”" ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1.Not Upheld Ad (a) stated, “London has an urgent air quality problem and it is impacting the health of Londoners”. The WHO had stated that air pollution was, “one of the greatest environmental risks to health” and attributed it to 6.7 million premature deaths annually worldwide. Defra acknowledged that air pollution could cause both short- and long-term effects on health, including increasing the symptoms and inflammation of those suffering from heart and lung diseases. Further to that the Chief Medical Officer’s 2022 Annual Report stated that the, “mortality burden of air pollution in England is estimated to be between 26,000 and 38,000 a year, but in addition many people suffer avoidable chronic ill health as a result of it. Improvements in air quality have been associated with improved health outcomes – for example, reductions in air pollution in London have led to reduced childhood asthma hospital admissions. Further reductions in air pollution will lead to significant reductions in coronary heart disease, stroke and lung cancer, among others”. We therefore understood that the link between air pollution and ill-health was indisputable among those bodies. Regarding air quality there were different standards of maximum limits of problematic particulates. There were the legal limits set by government and there were non-statutory recommendations made by organisations such as the WHO. We understood that a Defra report, published in September 2022, and entitled, “Air Pollution in the UK 2021”, stated that in 2021, the latest year they had figures for, the Greater London Urban Area did not meet the legal annual mean limit for NO2, one of the primary problematic particulates for air pollution. Based on the legal non-compliance with the NO2 annual mean limit value, which we understood had been in exceedance since 2010, it was reasonable for TfL to state that London did have an air quality problem. In addition, because of the widespread evidence and consensus that air pollution did have significant detrimental effects on people’s health, including 6.7 million premature deaths the WHO attributed pollution to, it was an urgent problem and we concluded that the claim was unlikely to mislead. On that point, we investigated the ad under BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation), but did not find it in breach. 2. Not upheld Ad (a) stated “to help clear the city’s air the Ultra Low Emission Zone is expanding across all London boroughs” and ad (b) stated “the Ultra Low Emission Zone is expanding across all London boroughs … to help clear London’s air”. The TfL consultation document outlined the forecasted changes to road traffic TfL expected in response to the expanded ULEZ and the impact that would have on emissions. They had used a number of datasets to estimate the number of vehicles that would be affected by the ULEZ expansion and of those vehicles the proportion that were compliant with the future ULEZ standards. TfL had then taken those figures to estimate how the remaining proportion of owners of the estimated non-compliant vehicles might change their travel behaviour in response to the ULEZ charge. They predicted the number of non-compliant car owners who would either switch to a compliant vehicle, not drive at all, find an alternative method of transport or reroute their car to avoid the charging area. TfL next used the figures generated from the estimated change in traffic volume and vehicle fleet, and applied them to the LAEI. The LAEI was an inventory of all emissions across London from a comprehensive range of sources, including road transport. The LAEI then modelled air pollutant concentrations, including NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 which were the particulates of the greatest concern. Using the estimated figures from TfL about road traffic changes, the LAEI model was then able to predict the effect on NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 caused by road traffic. The resulting figures showed a reduction of NOx in Greater London by 5.4% and a 5.5% reduction outside of Greater London (but within the region of the air quality study). For PM2.5 the results showed a 1.5% reduction in Greater London and a 1.4% reduction outside of Greater London (but within the region of the air quality study). For PM10 the results showed a 1% reduction in Greater London and a 1.5% reduction outside of Greater London (but within the region of the air quality study). In addition the average exposure of the population of Greater London to NO2 would experience a 1.3% reduction and those outside of Greater London a 1.1% reduction. For PM2.5, the reduction in Greater London and outside of Greater London were both negligible. The Jacobs Report was produced by a business consultancy firm on behalf of TfL. It used the modelled traffic figures and resulting air pollution statistics generated in TfL’s consultation document to identify key impacts of the proposed ULEZ, including changes in emissions of air pollutants. The impacts were expressed on a scale of minus three to plus three, with one being minor, two moderate and three major. The Jacobs report stated that regarding the impact of the predicted reductions in NOx emissions in 2023 after the ULEZ extension, for Greater London and outside of Greater London, they would both be “moderate”. Concerning PM2.5 and PM10 emissions the predicted reductions in Greater London and outside of Greater London would all have had a “minor” impact. Further to that, for NO2 the report showed the predicted reduction of average exposure of the population of Greater London and outside of Greater London respectively, would both have a “minor” impact. For PM2.5 the reduction in Greater London and outside of Greater London were both a “negligible” impact. Therefore, the results from the Jacobs Report showed that the implementation of the expanded ULEZ would reduce air pollution emissions and concentrations in Greater London and beyond to varying degrees; from negligible to moderate, according to the scale applied. The ads claimed that the ULEZ expansion was being implemented to help clear London’s/the city’s air and whilst the data indicated some improvement in relation to all air quality factors, the advert did not claim the ULEZ would be the single factor to improve air quality overall. We concluded that claims for the extension to help improve air quality were unlikely to mislead. On that point, we investigated ads (a) and (b) under BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation) and 9.8 (Environmental Claims), but did not find them in breach. 3. Upheld Ad (c) stated that it had been seen that NO2 had reduced by almost a half since the implementation of the ULEZ in Central London. Ad (f) said that the ULEZ was expanding across all London boroughs, but it had already made a significant difference by helping to reduce NO2 by nearly half in Central London. The TfL document “ULEZ one year report” stated that in October 2022 there had been an estimated 46% reduction in Central London roadside NO2 concentrations compared to a “no ULEZ” scenario.To calculate the reduction, TfL had used data from roadside monitoring sites for the period January 2017 until October 2022 for Central, Inner and Outer London. They had calculated the proportion of NO2 concentrations attributed to traffic alone. Then they had considered how NO2 concentrations had been impacted from sources outside the ULEZ, for instance, the nationwide shift of vehicles to newer, less polluting cars that was happening regardless of the ULEZ. Using that approach they had then calculated the difference between a non-ULEZ and a ULEZ scenario in October 2022. While we acknowledged TfL’s explanation of the basis of the percentage calculation, the claims “The Central London ULEZ has shown you can reduce air pollution, we have seen almost a halving of levels of nitrogen dioxide” and “The ULEZ has already made a significant difference by helping to reduce harmful nitrogen dioxide pollution by nearly half …” were likely to be understood as representative of the reduction in NO2 as recorded by, for example, air quality sampling before the introduction of the charges and since the implementation of the Central London ULEZ, rather than being based on the calculated difference between a non-ULEZ and a ULEZ scenario. Clear qualification was, therefore, required in order to ensure that the claims would be fully understood. Because the basis of the claims was not given, we concluded that the ads were likely to mislead. Ad (c) breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 and 3.2 (Misleading Advertising), 3.10 (Qualification) and 9.2 (Environmental Claims) and ad (f) breached CAP Code rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading Advertising) and 3.9 (Qualification). 4. Upheld The ASA understood no official definition of Outer London existed. We also understood the ULEZ had been introduced to Central London in 2019, and expanded to the Inner London area, inside the North and South Circular roads, in 2021. We considered, in the context of ad (d), which was about the ULEZ expansion, listeners would likely understand the term “Outer London” as referring to areas that had not already been covered by the ULEZ. We therefore considered listeners would understand the claim “most air pollution related deaths actually occur in Outer London areas” in ad (d) to refer to the proportion of air pollution-related deaths in the areas that had previously not been covered by the ULEZ. The 2021 ERG report had been commissioned to assess air pollution levels in London, their impact, and what effects air quality policies could have. The report used mortality figures in London gathered by the ONS and air pollution levels from 2019, which were the most recent figures available, to calculate the “mortality burden” of air pollution – the fraction of deaths that could be attributed to air pollution – in London at that time. We understood the figures relating to air pollution concentration in 2019 used in the mortality burden calculations had arisen from the London Air Quality Toolkit, a model provided with data from the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory. Additionally, we understood that the number of deaths used within the mortality burden calculations had originated from ONS reporting that averaged data from 2016, 2017, and 2018 to estimate the number of deaths in 2019. The report outlined the number of estimated attributable deaths in 2019 in each London borough from anthropogenic pollutants, specifically from PM2.5 and NO2. We understood, according to the framing of Outer London as based around boroughs that were either partially or not at all covered by the 2021 ULEZ, the estimated number of deaths attributable to air pollution in 2019 – the mortality burden – was 2,896 at the lowest estimate, and 3,321 at the highest. In Inner London, the estimated number of deaths attributable to air pollution in 2019 was 701 at the lowest estimate, and 777 at the highest estimate. While the evidence indicated that the mortality burden in Outer London was greater than that of Inner London, the ad did not clarify that the claim “most air pollution related deaths actually occur in Outer London areas” was based on modelled estimates, using the latest available data. We acknowledged that scientific research into air pollution and health often involved the use of models and estimates, and that the approach of the ERG’s report was consistent with the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants’, an independent Governmental advisory panel on the health effects of air pollution. However, we considered that listeners were likely to understand from the claim, which referred to ‘actual’ deaths, that the evidence supporting the claim was not estimated or modelled in anyway. Clear qualifying information to explain the basis of the claim was therefore required. Because the basis of the claim was not explained and evidence to support the claim as it was likely to be interpreted was not supplied, we concluded that the ad was likely to mislead. On that point, ad (d) breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 and 3.2 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation), 3.10 (Qualification) and 9.2 (Environmental claims). 5. Not upheld Ad (e) stated “Recent reports have shown a link between air pollution and an increased risk of developing dementia”. We considered listeners would understand that, in the context of the ad which also stated “We believe risk factors, such as air pollution, account for 40 per cent of dementia cases, many of which could be avoided\" to mean air pollution was a risk factor in developing dementia, and that those risk factors accounted for 40 per cent of dementia cases. We reviewed the 2016 Royal College of Physicians report, which focused on a range of health conditions that could be linked to air pollution. However, the report did not directly focus on the relationship between air pollution and the development of dementia, it stated only that air pollution had been connected to changes linked to dementia. While indicative of a relationship between air-pollution and health, it did not go far enough to support the ad’s specific claim. We reviewed the 2022 COMEAP report, prepared by the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants, who advised the government on the health effects of air pollutants. The report was a literature review of 69 previously published papers that explored the link between air pollution and cognitive performance and decline. Of those 69 papers, 16 focused on the link between air pollution and dementia, and the report found that exposure to air pollution had been significantly associated with dementia in several studies. The report concluded that the epidemiological evidence suggested an association between exposure to ambient air pollutants and both the risk of developing dementia and acceleration of cognitive decline. In 2017 the Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care (The Lancet Commission) identified nine potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia – obesity, depression, physical inactivity, low social contact, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, hearing loss, and lower education. The Lancet Commission’s 2020 report (the 2020 report), a systematic literature review, added three factors to that list – air pollution, traumatic brain injury, and drinking more than 21 units of alcohol a week. The 2020 report completed new reviews and meta-analyses and found that those 12 modifiable risk factors accounted for approximately 40% of worldwide dementias, which could theoretically have been prevented or delayed. The 2020 report concluded that of the 40% of dementia cases that could be attributed to modifiable risk factors, 2.3% of that 40% were linked to air pollution. It also concluded there was sufficient evidence to include air pollution as a risk factor in developing dementia, and recommended national and international policies to reduce population exposure to air pollution as a dementia risk reduction strategy. The COMEAP report and the Lancet Commission’s 2020 report both concluded there was a link between air pollution and an increased risk of developing dementia. The 2020 report also concluded that 40% of dementia cases were due to risk factors, and that air pollution was one of them. We therefore considered it reasonable for TfL to make the claim in ad (e) and that it was unlikely to mislead. On that point, we investigated ad (e) under BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.9 (Substantiation), but did not find it in breach." ;

Transport for London (TfL) said the Mayor of London, the UK Government, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and health experts worldwide recognised the impact on health that air pollution had. They explained that in 2019 in Greater London, between 3,600 and 4,100 deaths were estimated to be attributed to air pollution and if no further action was taken to reduce it around 550,000 Londoners would develop diseases related to poor air quality over the next 30 years. The cost to the NHS and the social care system in London for that was estimated to be £10.4 billion by 2050. They said that the Regional Director for London in the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) had described air pollution as the biggest environmental health risk currently being faced. The OHID had said London had the highest percentage of deaths attributed to air pollution, of all English regions, with an estimated 4,000 deaths per year and while air pollution affected all those in London, the poorest and most vulnerable were most impacted. The OHID further said that action on air pollution could not wait and needed to be tackled with the urgency and ambition it demanded, to safeguard younger people and future generations. TfL stated that the UK Chief Medical Officer’s Annual Report, published in December 2022, included information on deaths from air pollution. The report mentioned that for the first time a death had specifically been linked to air pollution - a child from South London, who the coroner stated had died of asthma, contributed to by exposure to excessive pollution. TfL said the WHO and the European Union (EU) had recognised that stricter air quality targets were needed to protect people’s health and the UK government had set a new limit for particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less (PM2.5) to be in force by 2040. TfL stated that nowhere in London currently met the WHO 2021 Air Quality Guideline for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or PM2.5, and improving air pollution and moving towards those guidelines should be done as soon as possible. It was therefore an urgent problem that required immediate action. Clearcast said, in relation to ad (a), they were provided with evidence, including published research and a paper from Imperial College London and a number of reports and statements from the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP), including a review of air pollution research on dementia and cognitive decline, effects on mortality by NO2, the effects of air pollution on cardiovascular disease and the effect on mortality for long-term exposure to air pollution. They stated that the latest Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) report stated that London did not meet the legal limits for NO2. Separately London did not meet the WHO guidelines and targets published in September 2021. They said based on that information, and especially because London did not meet the legal limits for air quality, they believed London had an urgent air quality problem and the ad itself included verification signposting the viewer to where to find more information about how London was impacted by air quality. 2. TfL said for the 2023 ULEZ expansion, air quality modelling was undertaken by Imperial College London working with TfL. The modelling looked at NO2, particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres or less (PM10) and PM2.5 which were generally accepted indicators of air quality. Modelled air pollutant concentrations were based on those listed in the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI). The LAEI was a comprehensive inventory of all emissions across London, up to and including the M25, including transport, industrial and commercial, domestic and other miscellaneous sources such as agriculture or accidental fire. TfL also estimated changes to road traffic (such as people moving from cars to more sustainable modes of transport like cycling, public transport or walking) and vehicle changes from drivers who switched to ULEZ compliant vehicles. Those estimates were then fed into the LAEI. They said that results, which were published in their consultation document, ‘Our proposals to help improve air quality, tackle the climate emergency and reduce congestion by expanding the ULEZ London-wide and other measures report’, showed NOx (the collective term for nitrous oxide and nitrogen dioxide) emission reductions in Central, Inner and Outer London. The area with the biggest changes, and so the largest improvement in air quality, was Outer London. For PM2.5, while the modelling showed a reduction across all of London for cars and vans, overall concentrations were expected to remain largely the same. In more local areas there would be small improvements but equally in other local areas there would be a small increase (due to changes in traffic flow). The modelling further highlighted that an additional 44,200 people in Inner and Outer London would live in areas where PM2.5 concentrations were below the WHO interim target of 10 µg/m3 for the first time. They said for PM10 emissions, the results showed that there would be a reduction for all vehicles and across the whole of London from the expansion. They said that information was used in the “Integrated Impact Assessment” study produced by Jacobs (the Jacobs Report), a business consultancy firm. They said the Jacobs Report was published in May 2022 and looked at the potential positive and negative environmental, economic, health and equalities impacts of the ULEZ proposal. It also identified measures to enhance or mitigate impacts. The Jacobs Report noted impacts varied due to location. It explained that the London wide ULEZ expansion was expected to result in a moderate reduction in NOx in Outer London and across Greater London, minor reductions in PM2.5 and PM10 in Outer London and across Greater London, minor to negligible changes in NOx in Central and Inner London where the existing ULEZ operated and negligible changes in PM2.5 and PM10 in Central and Inner London where the existing ULEZ operated. The report stated that the ULEZ expansion would benefit five million Londoners who live in Outer London, as well as those visiting and working in the city. Also it was forecast to reduce NOx emissions in Outer London from cars and vans by 10 and 7% respectively in 2023. They said the forecasted reductions in NO2 concentrations in the report would mean tens of thousands of Londoners would benefit from cleaner air and nearly 340,000 would live in areas meeting the WHO interim target. London’s most deprived communities would experience an improvement in air quality, with 99.9% living in areas with improved NO2 concentrations and 97% would live in areas with improved PM2.5 concentrations. The Jacobs Report concluded that all benefits across Greater London were either moderate or minor. In those circumstances it was accurate and appropriate to state that the expanded ULEZ was expected to “help clear the city’s air”.Clearcast said, in relation to ad (a), they had seen details of the LAEI 2019 report which provided a breakdown of pollutant emissions by source. They had also been supplied with a November 2021 study written by Imperial College London, “Has the ultra low emission zone in London improved air quality?\" It concluded that the ULEZ was one element of a multi-faceted set of policies which would lead to improved air quality. They said that from the evidence provided it was clear that preventing older and more polluting vehicles being on the road would help clear London’s air. They noted that the ad only said ‘to help clear the city’s air’ and had not stated that the ULEZ alone would clear London’s air, just that it helped to do so. 3. TfL said the level of NO2 had almost halved due to the existing Central London ULEZ. They had published several reports on the impact of the ULEZ scheme which all had been peer reviewed by the environment Research Group at Imperial College. They explained that in Central London, NO2 concentrations had been estimated to be 44% lower after six months than they would have been without the ULEZ, and 46% lower after one year. They explained that their figures were based on an impact assessment and used estimates based on the difference between a non-ULEZ and a ULEZ scenario. While they had known NO2 data from air-quality monitoring they said that did not provide a suitably robust assessment of the impact of ULEZ in the way an impact assessment did. They stated that to successfully measure the impact of a policy intervention like the Central ULEZ it was necessary to measure pre-compliance and not just consider results from when the policy began or shortly after. Pre-compliance for the Central ULEZ was stimulated by a number of events. That included the initial announcement in 2017 of the proposed implementation of the scheme. There were also early marketing campaigns for drivers and engagement with businesses operating in the relevant areas and the launch of the scrappage scheme to assist pre-compliance and help non-compliant vehicle owners. Finally, there were long-term changes to TfL fleets such as buses, taxis and private hire vehicles which began with the initial consultation and went beyond the implementation of the scheme. They said for those reasons it was not appropriate to consider the impact of the scheme from the day it began and assume the affected population changed their behaviour on that day. That was especially the case for individuals who used the scrappage scheme or purchased new vehicles in response to the scheme, which would have taken time and planning. They were examples of the overall intent of the scheme, which was to incentivise people to not pay the charge by acting in advance. They added that if the policy was considered only from the first few months of its introduction, this would not allow a sufficiently long enough time period to measure the emissions reduction, account for any weather or seasonality changes or consider fleet changes. It also missed out the NO2 concentrations TfL were monitoring prior to the launch. Radiocentre said they had accepted detailed evidence from TfL. The ULEZ six-month and twelve-month reports supported the claim. 4. TfL provided a 2021 report they had commissioned from the Environmental Research Group (ERG) at Imperial College London, who, they explained, were recognised as a world-leading authority on air pollution. TfL said the report titled “London Health Burden of Current Air Pollution and Future Health Benefits of Mayoral Air Quality Policies”, was the latest report on the health burden of long-term exposure to pollution in London. The report detailed the impact air pollution, specifically PM2.5 and NO2, was having on mortality across London and the level of influence future Mayoral policies could have on it. TfL said no single official definition of “Inner London” and “Outer London” areas existed. Ad (d)’s reference to the expansion of the ULEZ across all London boroughs was intended to reflect how the ULEZ would cover all London boroughs after its expansion. They provided a table that outlined three different permutations of Inner and Outer London and said that under each framing the claim “most air pollution related deaths actually occur in Outer London areas” had been substantiated. TfL said a range of factors influenced the impact of air pollution on mortality. One factor was age, and they highlighted that there was a higher number of older people in Outer London than in Inner London. They said that explained why Outer London boroughs had higher numbers of air pollution-related deaths, despite having lower overall levels of pollution. They said 14% of the population of Outer London, approximately 680,000 people, was aged 65 and over, whereas 10% of Inner London residents, approximately 380,000 people, were aged 65 and over. Those statistics were taken from the Office of National Statistics’ (ONS) Census Output Area Population estimates from mid-2019. TfL said it was well established that air pollution had negative effects on health throughout life, from pre-birth to old age. They highlighted how The Chief Medical Officer’s Annual Report in 2022 had stated that the deaths attributable to air pollution in England were estimated to be between 26,000 and 38,000 a year. They said air pollution also increased the risk of developing heart disease, strokes, lung disease, and lung cancer and it reduced life expectancy. Radiocentre said they had cleared ad (d) for broadcast on the basis of the report prepared by the ERG. 5. TfL said ad (e) had not claimed a direct link between air pollution and developing dementia, nor that air pollution was the only contributing factor in its development. Their intention had been to highlight the recent reports that had explored a link between the two. They said the claims in the ad were based on the UK Health Security Agency’s Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants’ (COMEAP) 2022 report “Air Pollution: cognitive decline and dementia”. That report had concluded it was likely that air pollution did contribute to an increased risk of mental decline and the development of dementia in older people. TfL also provided a 2020 report from The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention and care, published in The Lancet journal. The report had concluded that 40% of dementia cases could have been prevented or delayed by targeting 12 modifiable risk factors, one of which was air pollution. They also provided a 2016 Royal College of Physicians report titled “Every Breath We Take: the lifelong impact of air pollution” which concluded air pollution has been linked to cancer, asthma, stroke and heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and changes linked to dementia. They said there was an increasing body of evidence that showed the link between breathing polluted air and a wide range of health effects including dementia, Type 2 diabetes, and adverse effects on foetal growth and birth. Radiocentre said they had cleared ad (e) for broadcast on the basis of the 2020 Lancet Commission report." ;

1. Environmental damages: The plaintiff accused the defendant of engaging in long-term practices that included emitting waste gas, dust, and key pollutants above standard levels, tampering with or forging pollution monitoring data, and failing to maintain automatic monitoring equipment. The plaintiff argued that these actions constituted an environmental tort and requested the court to hold the defendant accountable for civil liabilities. The plaintiff sought court orders for the cessation of the infringement, the elimination of pollution risks, environmental restoration, compensation for the loss of environmental services, and a public apology.
2. Carbon Emissions: The plaintiff alleged that the defendant exceeded the permissible limits for carbon dioxide emissions. As a result, the plaintiff requested the court to evaluate the atmospheric damage caused by these excessive emissions and demanded that the defendant be held accountable for ecological damage and required to provide compensation.
3. Carbon Quotas: The plaintiff argued that the defendant failed to pay for 821,596 tons of carbon emission quotas during the first compliance period of the carbon trading system, despite exceeding the allowable carbon dioxide emissions. The plaintiff requested that the court order the defendant to pay for 818,148 tons of carbon credits and implement energy-saving measures, pointing out that the defendant had only purchased 3,448 tons as of January 2022.""" ;

It then featured a woman working from home, trying to focus on her job despite her noisy home environment. The voiceover continued, “Inhale serenity, exhale whatever’s happening here. Now bring your focus back to your customer, Tom”. The woman was then shown starting to levitate off her chair, in the lotus position, saying the name “Tom” in an extended fashion, with a long ‘Om’ sound.

We acknowledged the complainants’ concerns that some people might have objected to the depiction of meditation and the use of the ‘Om’ sound in the context of the ad. However, we considered that viewers would be likely to interpret the ad as being a humorous representation of meditation practices which were widely associated with non-religious wellness or mindfulness techniques, used to help combat stress and maintain focus, and as a way of dealing with the pressures of working from home. In that context, we considered that viewers were unlikely to find the use of the elongated ‘Om’ sound in the name ‘Tom’ to mimic or mock a specific spiritual practice, and we considered that the ad was unlikely to be seen as being derogatory to any specific religion. We therefore concluded that the ad was unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence, and did not breach the Code. We investigated the ad under CAP Code (Edition 12) rule4.14.1Marketing communications must not contain anything that is likely to cause serious or widespread offence. Particular care must be taken to avoid causing offence on the grounds of: age; disability; gender; gender reassignment; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity; race; religion or belief; sex; and sexual orientation. Compliance will be judged on the context, medium, audience, product and prevailing standards.Marketing communications may be distasteful without necessarily breaching this rule. Marketers are urged to consider public sensitivities before using potentially offensive material.The fact that a product is offensive to some people is not grounds for finding a marketing communication in breach of the Code.(Harm and offence), but did not find it in breach." ;

They said they did not believe the ad would cause serious or widespread offence to viewers in general, or viewers of a particular faith. In relation to the use of the elongated ‘Om’ sound, Salesforce said that their research and understanding of the word indicated that it had been widely adopted as the unofficial symbol of yoga, and was increasingly associated with yoga, meditation and the wellbeing movement. They told us that they believed the use of the ‘Om’ sound to be a common practice in non-religious yoga lessons. Salesforce said that they do not view the use of ‘Om’ in their ad as depicting a sacred symbol or tenet of any faith, but rather as an aid to meditation, which they considered to be part of everyday usage of the word. They told us that the ad did not reference or seek to imitate any specific religious imagery or symbolism, did not have any direct reference to religion, and was not mocking or derogatory. While Salesforce acknowledged the need to show care and attention when using symbols or images that could have associations with religion, they believed the ad’s language separated the visual content from any specific religious faith or practice. They further said that they believed the language used in the ad to be neutral and designed to poke gentle fun at the wellness industry, rather than be dismissive or disrespectful of any religion.Channel 4 said that it was their standard operating procedure for all commercials broadcast on All4 to be sent to Clearcast for BCAP/CAP approval and advice. They said this ad had been Clearcast approved with no additional scheduling restrictions. They also said that they understood that meditation was not solely practiced for religious and spiritual reasons, but also to help people practice mindfulness. They said they felt that the lead character in the ad depicted meditation in a positive manner, as it allowed them to focus on their customer amid a chaotic domestic scene. Clearcast said that while they recognised meditation had a base in spirituality, they understood that it was not solely practiced for spiritual or religious reasons and was also used to develop mindfulness techniques, and skills such as attention and awareness. They said they viewed the ad as portraying meditation in a positive way, by helping the lead character to focus, despite the hectic background environment. Clearcast also stated that they understood the elongated ‘Om’ sound to be part of the name ‘Tom’, and not specifically a use of the word ‘Om’. They did not feel the ad was negative or demeaning to any particular religion and did not believe that it would be likely to cause widespread offence, which they felt was reflected in the low number of complaints received." ;

The complaint was brought against Drax, a UK-based energy company, which operates several biomass and hydroelectric power stations in the UK. Drax has an international supply chain operation, including in Canada, Estonia, and the United States, for sourcing wood pellets for use at one of its power stations.
The complaint was brought jointly by The Lifescape Project, The Partnership for Policy Integrity, The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Biofuelwatch, Save Estonia’s Forests, and Conservation North.
The complainants allege that Drax has not observed the OECD guidelines by publishing a range of misleading or inaccurate statements about its carbon emissions and the environmental impacts of its business and supply chain activities.
In July 2022, after an initial assessment, the NCP decided the complaint merited further consideration in respect of provisions in the guidelines on the environment and on consumer interests.

An answer was needed so we started connecting the dots, to become a progressive energy and solutions partner, enriching lives for a sustainable future.” Solar panels, children in classrooms, a well being built and recycling in a factory were shown.

To reduce emissions, grow renewable energy … impact and promote a circular economy, as well as achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050” to mean that Petronas was already an energy company that was contributing to a sustainable future by making progress towards emissions reductions and growing the use of renewable energy, as well as having a plan in place that would result in it achieving these goals and net zero by 2050. We acknowledged that the ad stated, “… as the world produced more energy it became nature's problem, and we were part of it”, which Petronas believed made clear that the ad did not exaggerate the environmental benefits of the company. However, this claim was about their past contribution to the impact of energy production on the environment. It did not therefore counteract the claims in the ad about Petronas’s current activities and future plans, which suggested they were now primarily focused on positive environmental activities which were already having a positive overall impact today and would lead to net zero by 2050. We further acknowledged that Petronas said they were taking steps towards net zero and promoting sustainable energy, and these were reflected in the ad. The other claims in the ad were intended to be aspirational rather than targets that had already been achieved. However, despite that, in 2021 Petronas’ operations produced 45.2 million tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs). While we considered that viewers would recognise that companies in the oil industry were likely to be higher emitters of greenhouse gases than many other industries, we did not consider they would understand the extent of Petronas’ continuing significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions given the presentation and claims in the ad - that Petronas were already taking steps that had a positive impact on the environment, which went beyond aspirational claims. We therefore considered information about the balance of Petronas’ current activities, its emissions and the pathway to reducing them in line with the claims made in the ad, was material information likely to affect consumers’ understanding of the ad’s overall message and so should have been made clear.

The ASA acknowledged Toyota’s comments that the sheer volume of cars in the ads would lead viewers to interpret the scenes as fantastical and not as a portrayal of real-world driving. Ad (a) initially presented a large volume of cars in a rural setting seen from a distance, all moving as one across an open landscape in a manner that some viewers might infer was analogous to a herd of animals and therefore might be viewed as fantastical. However, the scenes that followed in ad (a) showed a much smaller number of cars at close-up, driving realistically at speed across an untarmacked, off-road landscape including across a river. Toyota had explained that some of the rural scenes in ad (a) were on roads or unpaved tracks. However, that was not clear in the ad. The emphasis of the ads was on the off-road settings displayed and the vehicle’s movement without restriction, which was highlighted by the messaging, “One of nature’s true spectacles” and “Born to roam”. The latter scenes saw the vehicles driving realistically on roads, and in heavily built-up urban settings, with a final scene again depicting one vehicle parked in an off-road landscape. Ad (b) also showed a number of vehicles in the distance and two prominent vehicles close up, which were depicted realistically in an off-road setting. The vehicles in ad (a) travelled across untarmacked plains and through rivers, with dust and scree visibly disturbed. In ad (b) the main vehicle appeared on a rocky slope, and other vehicles in the background travelled across similar terrain as seen in ad (a). While we acknowledged Toyota’s point that they were in part targeting specialised vehicle users, such as farmers or forest workers, who might legitimately need to use vehicles in rural or off-road environments, those scenarios were not represented in the ad, which included driving by unidentifiable categories of vehicle users in both rural and urban environments. We therefore considered that the impression given by the driving scenes and messaging in both ads was one of driving regardless of its purpose, across off-road environments and natural ecosystems which had no regard for the environmental impact of such driving. The ads presented and condoned the use of vehicles in a manner that disregarded their impact on nature and the environment. As a result, they had not been prepared with a sense of responsibility to society.The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Compliance)." ;

In addition, they had granted hundreds of royalty-free licences for the use of their hybrid technology. All of which demonstrated the importance they gave to environmental responsibility. They said the ads had been through a thorough checking process for both technical capability claims and wider generic claims for the vehicle and/or the brand.Regarding ad (a) they said the footage of the vehicles off-road was minimal and when they appeared they were never in an environment which was ecologically sensitive or a habitat with wildlife. Further to that the terrains depicted in the ads were all areas for which the vehicle was designed.. The Hilux was meant for the toughest environments and certain industries had a genuine need for off-road which included specialised workers such as farmers, forestry workers and park rangers. They said they were entitled to advertise to those markets and should be allowed to depict suitable off-road environments to demonstrate the off-road capabilities of the vehicle. However, they stated that they should be allowed to do that in a way that was not restrictive and did not involve depicting a specialised worker character or scenario in the ads. They further stated that if ads were able to show cars on race tracks or circuits, then off-road environments should also be permissible. The video had been shot in Slovenia on private land, with permission, and it was unlikely that viewers would see the environment depicted as being in the UK. They explained that the use of multiple vehicles, which they believed was clearly fantastical, added to the argument that a viewer was unlikely to replicate the ad in the UK countryside. They said that the fantastical presentation of the large number of vehicles would prevent consumers emulating the ad and driving in large numbers in the wild. They explained that despite the Hilux’s off-road capabilities, and the need to make specialised purchasers aware of that, they limited the off-road footage because of their dedicated environmental stance and consideration for social responsibility. They said as a result, based on screen time, the emphasis of the ad was not on the off-road scenes. Specifically there were four off-road scenes taking up 11 to 12 seconds of a 30-second video. The first scene was in a desert with mountains either side. It was shot from the middle distance and so it would not have been possible to identify the terrain but there was nothing to say it was inappropriate for car use. In addition, the number of cars, the trailer and background gravel indicated that the vehicles were on a road or unpaved road. A close up in one scene indicated a dusty, unpaved road. The second scene showed a forest surrounding an open gravel plain. The ground of the open plain had visible tyre tracks, indicating it was a regularly used off-road path. A third scene featured a visibly beaten track or unpaved road suggesting regular use. The track joined a public road and so indicated that it was suitable for and designed for vehicles. The fourth scene showed the car parked and did not indicate any irresponsible off-road use. They explained that the speed of the vehicles in the ad was appropriate and while dust was shown when the cars moved, that was not an example of irresponsible driving. They further said that the line “One of nature’s true spectacles” was a reference to a herd of vehicles and not to damage or destruction of a natural setting. Toyota believed no reasonable viewer would have understood the ad as encouraging UK consumers to drive irresponsibly in the UK countryside and cause environmental harm.Regarding ad (b) they said the image had been created completely by computer generated imagery (CGI) and so caused no damage to the natural environment. They understood the image would be seen as similar to a herd of wildebeests and therefore fantastical. In addition, and similar to ad (a), the landscape, which was akin to African plains, bore no resemblance to the UK or UK countryside, which indicated again that the ad was fantastical and would not lead to UK consumers emulating the large number of vehicles in the wild. They said that the slogan ‘Born to Roam’ was intended to reflect the ability of the car to operate off-road and cope with different terrain. They believed it would not be interpreted as encouraging or excusing driving behaviour that was negative to the environment. They said an off-road vehicle by definition was one used for rough terrain and the slogan ‘Born to Roam’, alongside the images and videos, visually represented that definition." ;

ON THE WAY. ARE YOU?\" The complainant alleged that Shell's statement on CO2 neutrality was misleading, referring to Shell's inaction on reducing CO2 emissions and the nature of Shell's business. The complainant referred to the District Court of the Hague's judgment on May 26, 2021 in Milieudefensie et al. v. Royal Dutch Shell plc. to highlight Shell's intentions. The complainant also argued that the rainforest wrongly suggested that Shell helped with the preservation of the rainforest. Shell, on the other hand, argued that it used carbon offsetting to reach carbon neutrality. Shell also argued that the \"I\" referred to the displayed truck, and not the company as a whole. Lastly, Shell stated that the rainforest was an example of the CO2 compensation programs. The RCC held that the slogan could be interpreted in various ways, and that it was unclear that it only referred to the truck. The RCC considered the slogan to be misleading as the cargo (fossil fuel) and the company itself were not CO2 neutral. Thus, the RCC considered the advertisement to be in breach of article 2 of the Code for Environmental Advertising. In its ruling, the RCC referred to the reasoning of the RCC's Ruling on Shell \"Drive CO2 neutral\" 1." ;

                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1. Upheld The ads featured prominent ELFBAR branding, the claims “RECYCLING FOR A GREENER FUTURE” and “GreenAwareness”, the recycling symbol, and an image of two ELFBAR 600V2 vapes which were identified as being a new product that was “AVAILABLE NOW”. That product was a single-use vape. The ASA considered the ads would be of most relevance and interest to consumers who were interested in purchasing the advertised products, many of whom would already be users of single-use vapes. The Material Focus research referenced by ELFBAR found that 73% of people who used single-use vapes threw them away. 70% threw them away because they did not know they could recycle them. We therefore considered that only a relatively small proportion of consumers who saw the ads would know that single-use vapes could be recycled. An even smaller proportion would be aware of the appropriate routes by which they must be recycled or how and where they could access them. We considered consumers would interpret the ads’ focus and emphasis on the recycling and ‘green’ messaging in that context. As such, in the absence of any information about how to recycle the products, they were likely to expect that if they purchased ELFBAR’s single-use vapes they would be able to recycle them through a wide variety of routes including through easily accessible routes such as general recycling provisions at home. Single-use (and rechargeable) vapes were classified as electrical and electronic equipment, which meant that to be responsibly disposed of they must be recycled, for both environmental and safety reasons. They could be recycled at local authority locations which catered for small electrical and electronic equipment waste, and at retail outlets which provided a drop-off service in-store. Retailers that sold less than £100,000 of electricals per annum could make provision for recycling at out of-store locations rather than providing an in-store route. We understood from Material Focus that at the time the ads were published many retailers that were legally obliged to provide in-store drop-off services were not doing so. We therefore understood that there were only limited recycling options for single-use vapes, some of which may not be easy for consumers to access. We acknowledged ELFBAR’s intention was for the ads to educate and encourage consumers to recycle, and that they would be undertaking initiatives that would increase consumers’ ability to do so. However, because consumers would understand from the ads that they would be able to recycle ELFBAR’s single-use vapes through a wide variety of routes including by easily accessible routes such as home recycling provisions, when that was not the case, we concluded the ads were misleading. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification), and 11.1 (Environmental claims). 2. Upheld As referenced above, we considered the ads focused on and emphasised recycling and environmental messages through the “RECYCLING FOR A GREENER FUTURE” and “GreenAwareness” claims. In addition to the implication that there were a wide variety of recycling routes available, including easily accessible ones, we considered, particularly in the context of the lack of consumer knowledge about the recycling of single-use vapes, that the ad also implied that ELFBAR single-use vapes were completely recyclable. We understood from information published by Material Focus that up to 80% of the materials in vapes (single-use and rechargeable) could be recycled. They clarified that this excluded energy from waste, which if included would result in a percentage in the high 90s. They said, however, that vapes were particularly challenging and expensive to recycle. ELFBAR’s newest single-use vape models included non-soldered batteries, which were easier to remove and therefore aided the recycling process. They had said that 41% of each ELFBAR 600V2 vape could be reused, and 55% could be recycled (which would include energy from waste). We accepted that the total 96% reuse and recyclability rate for individual ELFBAR 600V2 vapes that were processed by ELFBAR’s recycling partner was high, but they were not completely recyclable. We also had not seen information about the recyclability of their other single-use vapes – the ELFBAR V1 (which was still available for purchase in October 2023) and the “Cigalike”. Additionally, we considered the claim “for a greener future” was ambiguous, and without qualifying information was likely to be understood by a significant proportion of consumers as a claim that ELFBAR’s recyclable vapes had less environmental impact than other vape products on the market. ELFBAR believed their single-use vapes had a higher reuse/recyclability rate than those of their competitors, but had not provided evidence of that. Additionally, we understood that single-use vapes had a significant impact on the environment, based on their full life cycle. While the accessibility to recycling provision and the amount of recyclable material within a single-use vape was similar to that of rechargeable vapes, over the course of their full life cycle more materials were used in delivering the same amount of vape inhalations than would be delivered by a rechargeable vape. Furthermore, while single-use vapes could be recycled, Material Focus’ research had found that over five million per week were being thrown away, and as a result were taken to landfill or incinerated. That equated to 65% of the 7.7 million single-use vapes purchased per week. Because we had not seen evidence that ELFBAR’s recyclable vapes had less environmental impact than other vape products on the market, we concluded that the claim “for a greener future” was likely to mislead consumers. We considered that the inaccurate impression that the products were fully recyclable combined with the claim \"for a greener future\" exaggerated the environmental benefit of the products and was therefore likely to mislead consumers. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 11.1, 11.3 and 11.4 (Environmental claims). 3. Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications must not mislead consumers about the environmental benefit that a product offered, for example by highlighting an environmental benefit that resulted from a legal obligation if competing products were subject to that legal obligation. The WEEE Regulations required all producers of electrical and electronic equipment to finance the take-back of such equipment, which included vapes, for recycling. In the context of the ads’ ambiguously general focus on and emphasis of recycling and environmental messages, and the lack of consumer knowledge around the recycling of single-use vapes, we considered consumers would interpret the ads to mean that there was something unique about ELFBAR or its products in relation to the environmental benefits it offered in relation to recycling. That could include, for example, the provisions they made for recycling their products or the funding they put towards such provisions, or the recyclability of the products compared to similar products. We acknowledged ELFBAR’s initiatives to increase consumer awareness around the recycling of single-use vapes and to improve the recyclability of their products, and that these were not part of their obligations under WEEE. However, we had not seen evidence that ELFBAR or its products were unique in relation to its initiatives relating to recycling, and noted that ELFBAR’s competitors had the same obligations in relation to the funding of take-back for recycling as ELFBAR. We considered the ads misled regarding the environmental benefits of the product, including as discussed at points 1 and 2, as well as those that resulted from a legal obligation that competing products were subject to. We therefore concluded the ads were misleading in that regard.

The ads were placed by Imiracle (HK) Ltd t/a ELFBAR, the global owner of the ELFBAR brand. They authorised Green Fun Alliance Ltd (ELFBAR), the importer and one of the distributors of ELFBAR products in the UK, to respond to the ASA. ELFBAR said that research by Material Focus (a not-for-profit organisation aiming to ensure that electricals were reused and recycled), conducted in 2023, had shown that 70% of people threw away their single-use vapes because they did not know they were recyclable. The general intention of the ads was therefore to raise awareness that their vapes could be recycled and to encourage consumers to engage with recycling; the “GreenAwareness” programme was intended to communicate that. While they could continue to improve their products and increase their recycling initiatives they were reliant on consumers to actively recycle to reduce the number of products being thrown away. They considered consumers would interpret “Recycling for a greener future” to mean that they were generally encouraging the recycling of vapes, and that vaping products – including ELFBAR vapes – were capable of being recycled. They did not think consumers would understand it as an absolute claim about the environmental impact of their products, or as a claim that their products were necessarily any more environmentally friendly or offered other environmental benefits compared with their own or competitor products. The ads did not include a specific reference to their products or vaping products generally; they said the image of the products was incidental. ELFBAR did not claim to be ‘greener’ but instead as striving for a “greener future” by increasing the awareness of the recycling of vapes more generally. Improved consumer awareness would encourage consumers to seek out information about the various means of recycling their products. ELFBAR also did not believe the ads would be understood by consumers to mean that vapes were recyclable (fully or otherwise), that they could be recycled through household waste or recycling provisions, or that they were easily recyclable elsewhere or through a variety of routes. The use of the recycling symbol indicated that an object was capable of being recycled, but not that it would necessarily be accepted in all recycling collection systems (including through household waste), or that it had been recycled. However, they recognised the ads could have been more specific about how vapes could be recycled and ELFBAR’s specific recycling initiatives. They said single-use vapes could be recycled through many outlets, including but not limited to supermarkets, selected vape stores, and at locally-authorised recycling sites. They said those outlets were comprehensive and widely accessible by consumers. The options for recycling vapes were as easily accessible as those for other small electrical items in the same waste category. They said there was not a requirement that recycling options be offered in-store, and in any case ELFBAR could not offer in-store recycling options directly as an online distributor only. ELFBAR was not responsible for what recycling options were offered by third-party retailers. They did not consider there was evidence that any one recycling method was more likely to improve the recycling of vapes (when compared with all options available) and that, as well as its obligations, it was also incumbent on consumers to take action to choose from the options available to them. Notwithstanding that, they were improving accessibility to recycling through their own initiatives. At the time the ads were published, 70 UK vape shops had dedicated ELFBAR recycling bins. This was a pilot programme which formed part of their work on developing and promoting a long-term recycling solution in the UK, under the GreenAwareness and “Recycling for a greener future” banners. They expected the number of independent shops in the programme to at least double by the end of 2023. The collection process was run in partnership with a lithium-ion battery and vape recycling company that delivered the products to an appropriately certified recycling organisation in the UK. The products were disassembled and the raw materials were recycled and reused. ELFBAR was also working directly with UK retailers to deliver free in-store vape collection bins. They were committed to providing several thousand bins across the UK, with the first bins arriving in-store in October 2023. Each bin would be issued with guidance to ensure retailers were aware of their statutory obligations, along with guidance on government-recommended waste collection companies. The location of those bins would be recorded and, where appropriate, included in relevant online search facilities. ELFBAR aimed to establish a closed-loop recycling system by 2025 that was mature, dismantlable and reusable. A new dedicated research and development facility was primarily focused on improved product development, to reduce environmental impact. One of their latest products (ELFBAR 600V2) had a modular and non-soldering design meaning that batteries could be more easily separated and recycled. They said their recycling partner had confirmed the design improvements enabled the reuse of 41% of each unit. They and their partners had been able to achieve a recycling and reuse rate of more than 96% and were working towards a rate greater than 99%. They said around 90% to 95% of an ELFBAR 600V2 could be recycled, excluding the cartridge that was treated separately because of chemicals. They were not aware of any competitor products that achieved the same rate. Less than 2% of the ELFBAR products they handled ended up in landfill. Their recycling partner had also confirmed that the battery in ELFBAR 600V2 vapes was 20% smaller than in the previous generation of the vapes. They highlighted that reduction was better for the environment than reuse or recycling. Additionally, the cartridge component of the ELFBAR 600V2 was incinerated at high temperatures, with energy recovery generating electricity. They therefore considered that even if the ads were understood as a statement about the environmental impact of their products they did not mislead about the environmental benefits, because ELFBAR 600V2 had a high recycling and reuse rate. Information about how to recycle their vapes was provided on their website. A dedicated page included links to a website operated by Material Focus. That website explained why it was important to recycle vapes and included a facility to search for locations where vapes – including specifically ELFBAR vapes – could be dropped off for recycling. ELFBAR was also developing a website to provide information to consumers about their GreenAwareness programme and to allow them to search for their nearest recycling location. 3. ELFBAR acknowledged that they, and their competitors, were subject to The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations 2013, which obliged vape producers to finance the take-back of vapes for recycling. They highlighted that, as required, both of their UK distributors were registered on the WEEE public register. They believed many of their competitors were non-compliant in that regard. ELFBAR said the ads highlighted their recycling responsibilities. Raising consumer awareness about recycling was not a legal obligation; they had chosen to invest resource into it. Additionally, the ads were not concerned specifically with the environmental benefits their products may or may not offer, nor did they claim directly or indirectly that their vapes were any more recyclable than any other vapes. The improved recyclability of ELFBAR’s products resulted from their product research and development, based on their own environmental commitments and initiatives. There was no legal obligation to consider the future recyclability of a product during product design and manufacture." ;

The complaint states that between September and October 2010, the defendant allegedly deforested, with the use of fire, 111,0675 hectares of native forest of the Amazon biome in an area of Union domain without authorization from the competent environmental agency.
The defendant claimed to be a farmer and to have carried out the deforestation to establish pasture for raising dairy cattle. Afterwards, the defendant was judged to be in default.
The decision of the judge set the final penalty at 04 (four) years and 02 (two) months of imprisonment and 30 (thirty) days fine. It was considered that the crimes committed under the articles 50-A and 41 of the Environmental Crimes Law were practiced in substantive joinder of offenses. In this occasion, the judge did not increase the base penalty of the crime provided for in art. 41 of the Environmental Crimes Law, as it was understood that the reasons that would give rise to an increase had already been considered when assessing the penalty related to article 50-A of the same law. The ruling refers to the emission of greenhouse gases when it mentions the use of fire by the defendant for the consummation of the crime of causing fire in a forest.
The MPF filed an appeal requesting the revision of the dosimetry of the penalty applied, pleading for the recognition of judicial circumstances that increase the penalty of the crime of forest fire. It argued that the impact of the use of fire in the Amazon on climate change should be considered, since the defendant's action was especially serious given the extent of the burned area. It mentioned the impact of the fire on human health and the livelihoods of indigenous peoples. It was questioned the feasibility of increasing the sentence in the first phase of dosimetry of the ruling due to the aggravated impact of the crime on climate change. It requested the reform of the decision to negatively value the circumstance of the consequences of the crime of article 41 of the Environmental Crimes Law.
The appeal is pending judgment by the competent Court.""" ;

Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the use of the term Medical School to refer to an educational institution that provided training for a career in medicine, specifically to become a doctor through completion of a Primary Medical Qualification (PMQ). In addition, that they would understand that any establishment deemed to be a medical school, and therefore the training it provided, was regulated by the GMC. We considered the use of the name London Medical School implied that the establishment held the same status as a Medical School that was registered and regulated by the GMC, and that it trained Doctors in the UK PMQ. We accepted that the training provided by the Centre for Medical Science and Research was registered with the UKRLP. However, we noted that this body did not quality assure or accredit the learning provision of registered providers in any way. Whilst the Centre for Medical Science and Research was registered with the CPD group, we considered those registrations were not equivalent to being registered with the GMC. Because the Centre for Medical Sciences and Research was not registered with the GMC and did not provide UK PMQ training, we concluded that the claim “Medical School” in the training provider’s name was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising) and3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation). 2. Upheld We considered that, in the absence of further qualification on the website and within the context of the educational environment, the use of the claim “London’s leading clinical skills and aesthetic medicine training provider” was ambiguous. We considered it would be understood by consumers to mean that they led every other London-based provider in terms of number of students or as measured objectively and independently in terms of the quality of the education provided. We therefore expected to see evidence to substantiate the claim on that basis, including evidence showing a comparison with all other relevant providers. We considered that evidence showing two examples of students attending their training did not substantiate their claim that they were leading in terms of their students’ numbers when compared against other London training establishments providing the same courses. Similarly, we did not receive any evidence to support the claim that the Centre for Medical Sciences and Research were a leading provider in terms of the quality of their courses. We did not consider the fact that certain universities or Trusts had used their service was evidence that they were “London’s leading provider” in terms of quality, and nor did we consider that the number of courses delivered was evidence of being the leading provider in terms of numbers, since no comparison had been made with other providers. Given the above, we concluded that the claim had not been substantiated and was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading Advertising) and3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

The Centre for Medical Sciences and Research Ltd t/a London Medical School and Aesthetics Clinic said that since being established in February 2016 they were now widely recognised among NHS Trusts, Universities and Clinics for the provision of clinical skills training and that they were registered with the British Government’s UK Register of Learning Providers (UKRLP). Their courses were accredited and certified by the CPD Group which was a nationally recognised accreditation and certification body. They said trading under London Medical School and Aesthetics Clinic was to reflect the nature of their training that was on offer. They said they were engaged in training PhD research students from Universities in London and Oxford, including Imperial College London and Kings College London. They stated that all UK universities had a website with a domain ac.uk. As their website domain was not ac.uk, they felt their website was transparent with regard to the courses they provided. The Centre for Medical Sciences and Research gave several dictionary definitions of the word ‘school’, and did not believe consumers would be misled by its use in the ad. 2. The Centre for Medical Sciences and Research said that they provided clinical skills to major NHS Trusts and universities. Therefore, by volume of training (student numbers) and quality, they considered it was fair and accurate to state that they were a ‘leading provider’. They provided several examples of suppliers’ forms for NHS trusts including Imperial College, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and Kings College as well as the invoices for two PHD university students who undertook training at the Centre for Medical Sciences and Research. They said they had delivered 1,337 individual courses to approximately 203 NHS staff members and 110 university students. They were not aware of any other London-based school that was providing training on such a scale or volume, and believed this clearly justified the wording “leading provider”. They said reputable universities and NHS Trusts were choosing their school instead of other schools for training of staff, and they did not feel misled. It followed that they were a leading training provider on the market. As a further assurance of quality, their courses were assessed and accredited by CPD Group. They said both directors of the company were Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) registered nurses. They delivered, among other things, courses provided by General Medical Council (GMC) to registered medical doctors. The quality of their training was exceptional. Both directors were altruistic individuals who, prior to establishing the School, spent their careers working for charities helping people into education, employment and housing. Since 2006, until Centre for Medical Sciences & Research Ltd was set up, both directors worked for several charities." ;

The MoEF claimed that the defendant had deliberately burned the peatlands with the intention of using it for plantation purposes. Moreover, neither the fire early warning system nor the detection system in the defendant’s concessions area met the requirements, a fact which the plaintiff used as proof of omissions. The MoEF mentioned that fires inside the defendant’s concessions had caused ecological and economic damages. For these damages, the MoEF requested compensation as high as IDR 243,291.006,270 for the damages and restoration costs. For climate-related damages, the MoEF claimed that the fires had contributed to the release of 4366.98 tC and a loss of function of carbon sinks which equal to 1528 tC. Since cost of released carbon is IDR 90.000 (equals to US$ 10), the MoEF ask for compensation of the released carbon and restoration amounting to IDR 530,588,070." ;

The ASA understood that at the time of the ad, 22 cases of cryptosporidiosis had been confirmed, with up to 100 more reporting symptoms to their GP. Affected residents were being advised not to drink tap water without boiling it first. We considered that consumers would understand the subject line “UPDATE: It’s gotten worse” and the opening claim “100 people have fallen ill in Devon now” both referred to the water contamination in Brixham. Along with the claim, “We can’t standby [sic] and watch this happen” and a promotional offer which their “shareholders didn’t love”, we considered the ad implied that the situation had reached a level of severity, such that the advertiser felt compelled to act. The ad contained subsequent claims about UK tap water more generally, including “Every home in the UK needs a water filter” and “UK tap water is broken”. We considered that the description of UK tap water as “broken” would be understood by consumers to mean that the system was no longer fit for purpose or working as it should, and that the situation in Brixham was an example of the consequences of the UK’s “broken” tap water. We considered that impression was reinforced by other claims such as “protect yourself with a filter” and “stay safe and please drink filtered water”. We understood that the marketing email was sent to consumers around the UK; the ad therefore suggested the drinking water across the UK was open to risk of similar contamination and that consumers across the UK were at risk of disease by drinking unfiltered tap water. The ad addressed the reader directly, urging them to “protect” themselves and “stay safe” by consuming only filtered water, and included a promotional code “URGENT”, which allowed the recipient to purchase a discounted water filter. We considered that the urgent tone and alarmist language used in the ad conveyed it was necessary for consumers to take urgent action and further contributed to the impression that drinking unfiltered tap water was a health risk. With that in mind, we considered the ad was likely to cause fear. Furthermore, we understood that the contamination in Brixham tap water was a temporary situation and was contained to the affected area. The boil water notice was not in place for the rest of the UK. We therefore considered that the ad exaggerated the health risks of UK drinking water and exploited people’s fears that tap water across the UK was unsafe to drink. We therefore concluded that, on the basis of a temporary situation limited to a certain geographical area, the ad was misleading, irresponsible and would likely cause fear and distress that was not justified. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 3.1 (Misleading advertising), and 4.2 (Harm & Offence)." ;

They considered that the issue in Brixham was not an isolated case and they provided two news articles and a peer-reviewed study which they believed demonstrated that the poor quality of UK drinking water had been widely reported by scientists and news outlets. They also provided another news article that quoted data from the government’s Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) and showed a total of 34 E. coli and Enterococci breaches in England and Wales in 2022. While they understood that UK drinking water had a quality rating of 99.96% and was regularly monitored for contamination, they believed the quality was not good enough, and the safety standards by which the water was tested were incomplete and outdated. For example, the water was only tested for two types of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), despite being a large group of manmade chemicals with reported health effects if consumed. Water2 believed the ad was factually correct in stating that 100 people had fallen ill in the area and that the situation had “gotten worse” since an earlier email they had sent about the issue. They said they had received messages from people affected by the contamination and had decided to reduce the price of their water filter so that it would be more accessible to those consumers in need. The statement, “This event is it, the day where everyone understands that we were right all along” referred to the significance of the contamination in Brixham for bringing into the public awareness the issues with the UK’s tap water. The advertiser provided a further news article about the Brixham community’s diminished trust in their water supplier. They believed the ad demonstrated Water2’s commitment to spreading awareness of the poor quality of drinking water in the UK through the promotional offer and statements such as “We can’t standby [sic] and watch this happen”, “Our shareholders didn’t love this idea, but they understand”, “Stay safe” and “We’ll speak soon”. Water2 believed that, while the ad was likely to cause reasonable concern, it did not amount to fear or distress. They emphasised that the claim “Every home in the UK needs a water filter” referred to the severity of the contamination in Brixham, the prevalence of similar contaminations around the UK, as shown by DWI data, and the general context of the poor quality of drinking water in the UK and implications that had on the health of the UK public. They clarified that, the use of “need” within the claim communicated that it was very important, rather than just desirable, that every home in the UK had a water filter. They said claims that UK tap water was “broken” and “protect yourself with a filter” similarly conveyed the poor state of the UK’s drinking water and its contamination with substances such as cryptosporidium, lead and PFASs. They pointed out that 80% of the Environment Agency’s fines in 2022 were given to the water sector, which they believed would not be the case if this sector was working as it should. Water2 confirmed that their product was able to filter cryptosporidium." ;

The ASA understood that some consumers did not wish to consume drinks with even trace amounts of alcohol, because there was a risk of physical or emotional harm. As descriptors such as ‘alcohol free’ were used for alcohol alternatives up to and including 0.5% ABV, the ABV of all alcohol alternative products should therefore be stated with reasonable prominence in the ad. The only reference in the ad to ABV was the label on the bottle of Heineken 0.0 beer held by Max Verstappen. However, the bottle of Heineken 0.0 beer was relatively small, especially comparing the text on the label to the image of Max Verstappen, who was the focus of the ad. We therefore did not consider that was a sufficiently prominent statement of the product’s ABV. Because the ad did not include a prominent ABV statement, we concluded that it was in breach of the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code rule (Edition 12) rule 18.19 (Alcohol alternatives). 2. Not upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications for alcohol alternatives may depict the product in circumstances where consumption of alcoholic drinks would be inappropriate or unsafe – such as prior to driving or daring physical activities – if it was clear the product was an alcohol alternative. Marketing communications must not encourage or condone consumption of alcohol in the same circumstances or imply the product was alcoholic. Resemblance to an alcoholic drink was acceptable as long as the ad made explicitly clear the product featured was an alcohol alternative. The ad featured a Heineken logo, rather than a Heineken 0.0 one, and a reference to the Drink Aware website, branding that was usually associated with alcoholic drinks, rather than alcohol alternatives. In addition, as set out in point one above, the only reference to ABV in the ad was the label on the bottle of Heineken 0.0 beer and we considered it was not sufficiently prominent. However, the ad stated in prominent text “The best driver is the one who is not drinking”, with the smaller text “Unless it’s …” shown next to the product. The logo in the top right-hand corner of the ad stated, “When you Drive, Never Drink”. We considered the message of the ad, which also showed a product with blue labelling, distinct from Heineken’s usual green labelling, was likely to be understood as promoting a product that, as opposed to an alcoholic beer, could be drunk before driving, a situation where the consumption of alcohol would be unsafe. While the statement of the product’s ABV was not sufficiently prominent, we concluded that it was clear from the ad’s overall context that the product was an alcohol alternative and, as such, its depiction in circumstances where consuming alcohol would be unsafe did not breach the Code. On that point, we investigated the ad under the CAP Code rule 18.20 (Alcohol alternatives), but did not find it in breach." ;

Heineken UK Ltd t/a Heineken said the ad was part of their longstanding ‘When You Drive, Never Drink’ campaign, in partnership with Formula One. They said a bottle of Heineken 0.0 was clearly visible at the front and centre of the ad with a prominent blue label, a colour they said was associated with alcohol free variants. The wording on the bottle was used to finish the sentence so that the line read: “The best driver is the one who is not drinking. Unless it’s Heineken 0.0.” Given the position of the Heineken 0.0 bottle, the use of colour associated with alcohol free products, and its overall sentiment, they believed it was clear the ad was for Heineken 0.0. However, they acknowledged that the logo in the bottom right corner was not a Heineken 0.0 logo and said they would use the Heineken 0.0 logo if the ad was to be used again in the future. They further stated that research by Speero showed that 97% of people read the title of online content. Therefore, they believed that the vast majority of consumers who saw the ad would have read the title of the ad, which included the ABV content in the product name. 2. Heineken disagreed that the ad irresponsibly encouraged drink driving. They said the ad actively discouraged people from drinking alcohol and driving, and instead offered an alternative to consumers. The ad conveyed the message that people should not drink and drive, and that an alcohol-free alternative should be the only option for drivers. That was reinforced by the text, “The best driver is the one who is not drinking. Unless it’s Heineken 0.0.”They added that the “When You Drive, Never Drink” logo, which included a red line through a bottle of five per cent Heineken, was clear on the ad. They further stated that there was no indication in the ad that Max Verstappen was about to drive. For instance, there was no image of a car or car keys. While Max Verstappen was closely associated with driving, he was not driving and was not in an environment that suggested he was about to drive." ;

In the image on the left, they were not smiling and were wearing plain, dark clothes, with no make-up. In the image on the right, they had a happy expression, were holding a champagne glass in the air, were wearing a red sequinned outfit, with matching jewellery, and had a full face of make-up. Text above both images stated “Before playing Mecca Bingo vs after playing Mecca Bingo”. A caption on the post stated “A good game can transform you! Don’t you just love that post-bingo glow.

The ASA noted the image on the left featured an individual with a blank facial expression, neutral stance, and dark clothing and who we considered was presented in a way in which displayed little emotion. This contrasted the image on the right, which showed the same individual with a happier facial expression while also wearing a full face of makeup. We also considered the addition of a raised champagne glass and brighter, more exuberant clothes, in the form of a sequinned outfit with matching jewellery, presented that person as having a higher level of confidence and an enhanced self-image in comparison to the same person in the image on the left. We considered the text above the image on the left, which stated “Before playing Mecca Bingo” and the text above the image on the right, which stated “vs after playing Mecca Bingo”, implied that an individual would achieve that higher self-image by playing bingo. We also considered that the caption on the post, “A good game can transform you! Don’t you just love that post-bingo glow” and the hashtags, “winning, “winningfeeling” and “feelingood” created an impression that an individual could improve their self-esteem, as well as their self-image, by not just playing bingo related games, but also by winning them. We acknowledged that the ad featured well-known drag queen Baga Chipz and that the two images, combined with a reference to being transformed, would have been interpreted by some viewers to be a reference about drag queens. We still considered the overall impression of the ad, particularly through the contrasting images, suggested gambling could improve an individual’s self-image or self-esteem. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad suggested gambling could enhance a person’s self-image or self-esteem, which was irresponsible and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 16.1 and 16.3.6 (Gambling)." ;

As well as offering bingo games, they said their goal was to provide customers with an exciting and entertaining experience. They said the purpose of the ad was therefore to convey that their services were fun and entertaining, with the post featuring the well-known drag queen Baga Chipz, who Mecca Bingo regularly worked closely with. They said the use of the “before and after” metaphor and the reference to having a “post bingo glow” reflected how a person may feel after a night at Mecca Bingo, and the modification of appearance was not an indication of enhanced personal qualities, self-image or self-esteem. They said the post included the word “transform”’ to convey this sense of enjoyment and because references to transformations were common in the drag entertainment industry. They said Baga Chipz rose to fame on the TV show Ru Paul’s Drag Race UK, which regularly used this language, and that viewers of the ad would be aware of that context and therefore would not take any reference to transformation literally. They believed viewers would consider the difference between the two images of Baga Chipz reflected a highly exaggerated portrayal of the emotions a person would have after enjoying the entertaining environment of a Mecca Bingo venue. Mecca Bingo said they deliberately omitted any reference to winning at bingo to ensure they avoided suggesting that the “feel good” factor of bingo only came from winning. They said the reference to having a “good game” was intended to refer to the positive experience and atmosphere of Mecca Bingo venues and the benefits brought by the social interaction people had when attending. They said there was nothing in the ad which suggested winning at bingo would give someone a sense of positive recognition, admiration or superiority. They acknowledged that the ad could have been misinterpreted if viewed without understanding it in its full context. They said they recognised the importance and requirements of the CAP Code and would ensure that future marketing including social media posts conveyed their messaging more clearly. They confirmed they had permanently removed the post." ;

On June 12, 2022, a post was seen on the Pack’s Facebook page which featured a video that started with several images of bowls filled with vegetables. The bowls were then shown filled with dog food. The video then showed dogs eating various The Pack products. On-screen text at the end of the video stated, “THE PACK. JOIN THE PACK FOR A HEALTHIER DOG & PLANET”. A caption accompanying the video stated “Better for The Planet”. A complaint was made to the Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) challenging whether these claims were misleading and could be substantiated.
By a ruling of November 2, 2022, the ASA upheld that complaint. The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear. The Code also stated that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise. The claims in the Pack’s ad were broad and non-specific. One possible interpretation was that the products shown were less detrimental to the environment compared to their conventional meat-based equivalents across their life cycles. Because the basis of the claims had not been made clear, and were not based on a full life cycle analysis of the products, the ASA concluded the ad did not comply with the rules of the Code on environmental claims.""" ;

CAP Guidance stated that advertisers should avoid using unqualified carbon neutral claims, and because information explaining the basis for those claims helped consumers’ understanding, such information should therefore not be omitted. It further stated that accurate information about whether (and the degree to which) the claim was based on an active reduction carbon emissions or based on offsetting should be included in ads to ensure consumers understood the basis on which carbon neutrality was achieved. The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the ad that Charles Tyrwhitt Shirts was a carbon neutral company, meaning that, as a business, they balanced the amount of carbon emitted into the atmosphere by an equivalent amount removed. Within that context, we considered consumers would understand that purchasing a Charles Tyrwhitt Shirts product would have a net neutral impact on carbon emissions and, therefore, climate change. However, we considered there was no information in the ad which explained the basis for Charles Tyrwhitt Shirts’ claim that they were a “carbon neutral business”. Although we acknowledged that Charles Tyrwhitt Shirts had based their claim on a report by a sustainability consultancy which they said demonstrated their carbon neutrality, we considered that they had not provided any qualifying information within the ad for the basis of the “carbon neutral” claim. Because there was no qualifying information in the ad which outlined the basis for the “carbon neutral” claim, which we considered was significant information that consumers needed to know in order to fully understand the claim’s meaning, we concluded that the ad was misleading.

Upheld The ad featured the claim “Safe Surgery”. The ASA considered that consumers would understand this claim to mean that undergoing abdominoplasty at MAYCLINIK could not result in any detriment to the patient. We acknowledged that the credentials and certifications the advertiser had referenced related to the quality of care and conditions at the hospitals and laboratories with which they worked. However, we understood that all cosmetic surgery procedures, including abdominoplasty, carried some level of risk to the patient, including when carried out at appropriately certified institutions. We therefore concluded that the claim “Safe Surgery” was misleading and that it was also irresponsible. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 3.1 (Misleading Advertising). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required marketing communications to be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. The ad included references to \"All Inclusive Packages\",\"5 Stars Accommodation\" and “Airport Transfer”, items of the cosmetic surgery package which people would closely associate with holidays. We considered that the ad was not likely to be interpreted as promoting a holiday; rather, its purpose was clear that it was for cosmetic surgery abroad. However, because the overall tone of the ad focused on the travel, together with the use of the colloquial term “Tummy Tuck” to describe abdominoplasty, it was likely to detract from the seriousness of the surgery offered. It was also relevant that the surgery would take place abroad which raised the potential for additional risks, such as: whether the doctors and treatment providers would have the same standards of care and safety as in the UK; and how any arrangements for follow-up care and dealing with any complications which arose would be managed. We considered that the ad could be interpreted as suggesting that surgery was a decision that could be undertaken lightly as part of a holiday, without serious consideration of the nature of the intervention. We therefore concluded that the overall presentation of the ad was likely to be seen as trivialising cosmetic surgery. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility)." ;

The ad showed a mother playing with her two infant children. A voice-over stated, “The doctor brought me in and he said ‘You have got blood clots in your lungs, if you’d have left it a day or two longer, you wouldn’t be here anymore’. You’ve always got in the back of your mind when you’ve been through something like that, or you were so close to being taken away from your babies, what if this happens again? What can I put in place to protect my kids? And that is everything that being a parent is about is protecting your children, and that shouldn’t stop when you die. So mothers if you are watching this and you don’t have life insurance, go to polly.co.uk, get a free quote, and get it sorted now”. The ad was cleared by Clearcast without a scheduling restriction." ;

What can I put in place to protect my kids? And that is everything that being a parent is about is protecting your children, and that shouldn’t stop when you die.” The ASA considered that the ad had a solemn tone and a realistic setting, with references to an incident of a parent experiencing a life-threatening health crisis and to the possibility of a parent dying. The ad used language which we considered simple enough that the ad’s message would be understood by young children. One of the complainants explained that their child had been distressed about the death of her parent after viewing the ad. We considered the ad could be distressing to young children, but that it would be suitable for older children to see. The ad therefore needed to be sensitively scheduled. The ad was cleared without a scheduling restriction that would have restricted it from being broadcast in or around programmes made for, or specifically targeted at, children. However, we understood that Clearcast had since flagged the ad as one which broadcasters should consider scheduling away from programmes for under 10-year-olds, which we considered was sufficient. The BCAP Code placed a general responsibility on broadcasters to ensure that they exercised responsible judgement on the scheduling of ads and that they operated internal systems capable of identifying and avoiding unsuitable juxtapositions between advertising material and programmes, especially those that could distress or offend viewers. The Code also stated that ads which were suitable for older children but could distress younger children must be sensitively scheduled. The complainants raised concern about the ad’s scheduling at 8.00 am during ‘The Amazing World of Gumball’ and 7.00 pm during ‘ThunderCats Roar!’. The BARB data showed that the audience was small enough that it was not possible to register the audience size and how many young children were watching the programmes. However, both were children’s programmes and we considered both would appeal to young children. We also considered the ad’s broadcast at 8.00 am in particular was at a time when young children might be watching TV by themselves. We considered those watching would expect ads to be scheduled with the children’s audience in mind and were unlikely to expect to see ads which could distress young children. For those reasons we considered the ad had been inappropriately scheduled. The scheduling of the ad breached BCAP Code rules5.15.1Advertisements that are suitable for older children but could distress younger children must be sensitively scheduled (see Section 32: Scheduling).(Children) and32.132.1Broadcasters must exercise responsible judgement on the scheduling of advertisements and operate internal systems capable of identifying and avoiding unsuitable juxtapositions between advertising material and programmes, especially those that could distress or offend viewers or listeners.(Scheduling of television and radio advertisements)." ;

They believed the ad conveyed a positive message about life insurance. The ad showed the children happy in their loving, home environment and there were no distressing scenes that could cause harm or offence. They said the mother was shown to be healthy, responsible and caring about herself and her children. Although the mother mentioned her illness, Cartoon Network said it was not exaggerated and did not exploit the fears of other mothers. They believed it was a matter of fact statement about an illness that influenced her decision to consider life insurance. The decision to take up the offer was presented as a rational and sensible option to provide for the family. Clearcast did not believe that the ad required an ex-kids restriction, which would have meant it should not have be shown in or around programmes made for, specifically targeted, or likely to be of particular appeal to children. They said the woman featured was not talking to the camera or in front of the children featured in the ad. Rather, it was a separate voice-over which outlined her previous concerns about her health condition and the fact that she believed that being a parent was about protecting your children and that that should not stop when you die. Clearcast said they had since applied a flag to the ad to ask broadcasters to consider scheduling it away from programmes for under 10-year-olds and to alert them that the ad contained references to death or someone dying. Candid Insurance Services Ltd t/a Polly said that the ad did not discuss a parent dying. They said the person in the ad provided a real-life example of being unwell. They said that everybody was unwell at times, and children were aware of that. Polly added the ad did not use or stoke fear. Polly said that younger children were highly unlikely to understand the medical statement and that the person did not die nor use the term “die” or “death” when describing the event. They said older children were aware of what doctors are and that people get sick. Polly said life insurance protected families financially and that the ad overwhelmingly discussed protecting children." ;

(\"ENI\") for its contribution to global warming. The lawsuit also includes ENI's two majority shareholders, namely the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (\"MEF\") and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti S.p.A. (\"CDP\"), which have the power to strongly influence the company's policies. The case is built on the landmark decision Milieudefensie et al. v. Royal Dutch Shell plc, which ordered Shell to reduce its emissions by 45% by 2030, relative to 2019, across all activities including both its own emissions and end-use emissions. According to the claimants, ENI’s own decarbonization strategy is not in line with the goals enshrined in the Paris Agreement and the best available climate science recommendations to limit climate impacts. It is alleged that ENI's conduct not only contributes to climate change, with all that it entails in terms of environmental risks and health consequences, it also violates human rights that are safeguarded and protected both by the Italian Constitution and by international norms and agreements. Besides, MEF and CDP are also deemed responsible for ENI's climate inaction, as, thanks to the ENI's shares held directly and indirectly, they have sufficient votes to exercise a dominant influence in the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting of ENI, which is equivalent to a situation of \"control\" of the State over the same company participated." ;

This public civil action is part of a set of 9 lawsuits brought by IBAMA on the same grounds, but against different defendants, to question illegal wood deposits and climate damage.
The plaintiff alleges that the storage of wood without proven origin is associated with illegal deforestation and predatory exploitation in the Amazon biome. Thus, it seeks reparation for environmental damages provoked by it, including (i) the damage caused to flora and fauna, (ii) soil erosion, (iii) contribution to global warming.
As for climate damage, it claims that unlawful conduct not only removed carbon sinks from the forest, but also caused the release of carbon into the atmosphere.
The plaintiff seeks redress through the determination of (i) an obligation to restore the vegetation in an area equivalent to that estimated by IBAMA, based on the volume of logs seized, amounting to 22.14 hectares, ideally in an area of the same biome in Indigenous Land, Conservation Unit or Agrarian Reform Settlement Project and (ii) an obligation to pay the climate damage based on the Carbon Social Cost (CSC) in the amount of R$ 2,149,975.55. It claims, based on the polluter pays principle, that the climate damage represents an external social cost that is not internalized by the illegal deforestation, leaving it to society. It also argues that climate damage can be quantified on an individual scale by multiplying the estimated GHG emissions of the activity by the CSC. In this case, IBAMA uses the Amazon Fund methodology to estimate emissions based on the area of the Amazon biome considered deforested, summing up to 8,125.38 tons of carbon.""" ;

If a general claim could not be justified, a more limited claim about specific aspects of a product might be justifiable. The ASA considered consumers would understand the unqualified claim “eco-friendly”, in the context of a website that allowed consumers to select a coffin for someone “concerned with protecting and preserving the natural environment”, to mean that the coffins listed under the “eco” section of the website would have either no impact or an overall beneficial impact on the environment over their full life cycle, including burial or cremation. The website, including the coffin listings, did not contain any other information to clarify the basis or limits of the claim. The life cycle analysis provided by the advertiser assessed the cremation impact and particulate emissions of a range of coffins when burned. It also assessed the total impact of the manufacture and distribution of different types of coffin. The life cycle analysis did contain information about which types of coffin might have a lower impact than others. However, it did not conclude that any kind of burial or cremation would have a neutral or positive environmental benefit. Because the evidence that had been provided to us did not substantiate explicit or implied claims that the wooden and MDF coffins had no negative impact on the environment over their full life cycle, we concluded that the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

The ASA acknowledged Lufthansa’s view that the claim, “CONNECTING THE WORLD. PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” in isolation was ambiguous and not clearly linked to the environment. However, we considered that the claim “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” was likely to be interpreted by consumers as an environmental reference to how Lufthansa's approach to aviation was protecting the future of the world, given that this text appeared immediately after the text “CONNECTING THE WORLD” and was superimposed on a picture of the globe. We noted Lufthansa’s comments that the campaign was based on specific steps taken to be more environmentally friendly, including aspirations to become carbon neutral by 2050 and to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030. However, the claim “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” was not qualified with this information. We considered the claim was likely to be understood by consumers to mean that Lufthansa had already taken significant mitigating steps to ensure that the net environmental impact of their business was not harmful. We understood that air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. We noted the initiatives and targets Lufthansa said they were committed to delivering in pursuit of their stated goal, but many of these initiatives were targeted to deliver results only years or decades into the future. We also understood that there were currently no environmental initiatives or commercially viable technologies in the aviation industry which would substantiate the absolute green claim “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE”, as we considered consumers would interpret it. We concluded that, because the basis of the claim had not been made clear and it had not been adequately substantiated, the ad breached the Code.

The purpose of the ad and wider campaign was to address the need to reduce the impact of flying on the environment and making consumers aware, chiefly via the website, of how Lufthansa were achieving that. They said that the tagline, “CONNECTING THE WORLD. PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” was open to interpretation, but in conjunction with the imagery it would not be understood as an absolute promise about their service, especially one linked to the environment, that their services caused no harm to the environment. They said it was also important to emphasise that “CONNECTING THE WORLD” was not an absolute claim and that it would therefore be inconsistent to conclude the second half of the tagline, “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” was absolute, when the former part was not. They explained that the imagery of half a plane and half a globe even presented the tagline as a potential dichotomy. In addition, the tagline in the ad contained no absolute statement stating that flying, or Lufthansa, had no impact on the environment and it would be incorrect to conclude the average consumer would understand the slogan in that way. They said that “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” would not be understood by consumers as a narrow and distinct reference to protecting the environment and the slogan would be seen by consumers as a mission statement intended to draw people to the website to raise awareness of the environmental issues related to flying and the steps Lufthansa had taken to address them. It was only by going to the website was the ad clearly linked to environmental claims and the website had sufficient explanation and was clearly qualified. The website stated that air transport connected people, countries and cultures and that its economic importance was wide ranging, creating employment and transporting goods. The website also made clear that Lufthansa were aware that the aviation industry emitted CO2, which had a negative impact on the environment. It was for that reason the website stated that they took their responsibility to climate change seriously and outlined the steps they were taking to protect the environment such as highlighting the purchase of new aircraft with lower fuel consumption and how Lufthansa were one of the largest purchasers of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. They said any consumer who saw the ad would be able to see, via the website, the environmental impact of air travel and Lufthansa’s actions to mitigate it. The website therefore provided context and substantiation for the ad.

Upheld The ASA considered consumers would understand the claims “A healthier plant based alternative” in ad (a) and “FOR A HEALTHIER DOG” in ad (b) to mean that a plant-based diet was healthier for dogs than a conventional meat-based diet. Additionally, we considered that they would understand from ad (a) that by switching from a meat-based diet to a plant-based diet, their dog could live for up to two and a half years longer. We assessed the evidence provided by THE PACK. The first study involved three groups of dogs fed: a conventional meat-based diet; a raw meat diet; or a vegan diet. The study stated that its reliability had been limited by, among other things, its reliance on owners’ perceptions of their pet’s health rather than veterinary assessments or laboratory based results. The reliability of the study had also been undermined by the fact 82% of respondents had no veterinary training or skills when assessing their pet’s health. The study concluded that a larger-scale, longer term study was needed. The second study surveyed 100 dog owners and aimed to quantify perceived health changes in a range of indicators following feeding of a single brand of UK-produced vegan dog food for 3 to 12 months. The study, which had not been peer-reviewed, and stated that the observations it contained could have been random coincidence relationships and that prospective, randomised, controlled clinical studies were needed to confirm the clinical significance of the observations. The third study collected diet information via an online form for 1,189 dogs – 56% being fed a meat-based diet, 30% a plant-based diet, 5% a mix of both diets and 9% an indeterminable diet. Owners were asked for their perception of their pet’s health. As with study one, we considered the reliability of the results was hampered by the respondents’ lack of veterinary training or skills when assessing their pets’ health. The study concluded that there were no adverse health outcomes from feeding dogs a plant-based diet, and that plant-based diets were generally perceived to be protective against health disorders by respondents. However, it also concluded that no causation could be inferred from the results, and there was a high risk of recall bias on behalf of the respondents. The literature review looked at vegetarian versus meat-based diets for companion animals. It concluded that while vegetarian diets could offer health benefits to both dogs and cats, they must be nutritionally complete and balanced in order to do so. They noted that studies in the area were rarely conducted in accordance with the highest standards of evidence-based medicine. THE PACK highlighted a 1994 survey by non-profit organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) that had formed part of the review. The PETA survey involved 300 dogs fed vegetarian diets, and found that 82% of those maintained on such a diet for five years or more were considered to be in “good” to “excellent” health. However, the review noted that the precise diets used in the surveyed dogs were not recorded”. The survey itself also stated that tests for statistical significance of the survey results had not been performed. The press release, which had been prepared by the World Health Organisation’s International Agency for Research on Cancer related to the classification of processed meat as carcinogenic in humans, and therefore only stated the health implications of processed meat consumption in humans. The report from the PFMA related to obesity in animals, but did not compare meat-based and plant-based diets in dogs. In view of the points raised above, we concluded that the body of evidence provided was not adequate substantiation for the ads’ claims that a plant-based diet was healthier for dogs than a meat-based diet, and the claims were therefore likely to mislead. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising) and3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear. The Code also stated that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise. The claims “JOIN THE PACK FOR A HEALTHIER … PLANET” and “Better for the Planet” in ad (b) were broad and non-specific. The video in the ad started by showing bowls of vegetables being turned into dog food, but provided little other context with which to interpret the claims. We understood dog food was conventionally meat-based, and that vegetable-based dog food was a relatively novel product. We therefore considered one possible interpretation was that the products shown were less detrimental to the environment compared to their conventional meat-based equivalents across their life cycles. THE PACK provided a life cycle analysis that detailed the CO2e emissions of the three products shown in the ad, No-Cluck Casserole, No-Moo Ragu and No-Fishy Dishy, and their meat-based alternatives, chicken, beef and fish. The analysis set out the emissions in the farming, transport, processing, packaging, storage and distribution stages of the products’ life cycles. THE PACK’s products were found to produce around 7 to 18 times less CO2e than their meat-based alternatives. However, we noted the report omitted the disposal of the products’ packaging in its analysis and therefore did not cover their entire life cycle. We welcomed THE PACK’s assurance that they would include more information when using the claim in the future. However, because the basis of the claims “JOIN THE PACK FOR A HEALTHIER … PLANET” and “Better for the Planet” had not been made clear, and were not based on a full life cycle analysis of the products, we concluded the ad did not comply with the rules of the Code on environmental claims. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules11.111.1The basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.and11.411.4Marketers must base environmental claims on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the marketing communication states otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle. If a general claim cannot be justified, a more limited claim about specific aspects of a product might be justifiable. Marketers must ensure claims that are based on only part of the advertised product's life cycle do not mislead consumers about the product's total environmental impact.(Environmental claims)." ;

This is Severn Trent water. Our water. That’s why we’re working towards protecting it, nature and our future by planting a bucket load of trees. One point three million in fact. And we’ve planted the town green with 72 tiny forests to keep our grand-kids grand-kids connected with nature. Let’s do right by our environment, our community, our water.

The ad stated “This isn’t just any old water. This is Severn Trent water. Our water. That’s why we’re working towards protecting it, nature and our future by planting a bucket load of trees. One point three million in fact. And we’ve planted the town green with 72 tiny forests to keep our grand-kids grand-kids connected with nature.Let’s do right by our environment, our community, our water. Get involved at wonderfulontap.co.uk”. We considered that the overall impression of the ad was that Severn Trent Water were making, and intended to make, a positive overall environmental contribution as a company. As part of that contribution, they were undertaking an environmentally beneficial activity by planting one point three million trees, which would have positive benefits for nature and the environment. We considered that the voice-over which stated, “Let’s do right by our environment, our community, our water” and the visuals used in the ads, which included various clips of nature imagery, contributed to that impression. The complainants were concerned because, around the time the ad was broadcast, there had been news reports that water companies had released raw sewage into UK seas and rivers. All water companies had licences and permits that they were required to comply with to reduce their impact and protect the water environment. The Environment Agency stated that storm overflows were a necessary part of the current sewerage system. They discharged storm sewage (wastewater diluted with rainwater) to rivers or seas during periods of heavy or prolonged rainfall to prevent storm sewage backing up into homes and streets. If they operated within those circumstances and were compliant with their permit, they were not reported and recorded as pollution incidents. Furthermore, water companies were monitored for their compliance with their permits to discharge treated water from sewage treatment works and water treatment works. We understood that in December 2021, Severn Trent were fined for sewage discharges from a number of their sewage treatment works that occurred during 2018. Their Environmental Performance Assessment (EPA) report from 2021 stated that they performed better than target (green status) for the number of sewerage pollution incidents and for their compliance with their discharge permit, although their performance was below target (amber status) for the number of serious pollution incidents. From 2019 to 2021, which we understood was the most recent year for which data was available, Severn Trent had overall EPA ratings of four stars (out of a possible four), which meant that they were classed as an ‘industry leading company’. Therefore, although there were areas of performance below target, their recent overall environmental performance was good. Because their overall environmental performance did not contradict the overall impression of the ad, we did not consider that their history of releasing sewage into the environment was material information that needed to be included in the ad to prevent viewers from being misled. We therefore concluded that the ad was unlikely to mislead. We investigated the ad under BCAP Code rules 3.1, 3.2 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation) and 9.2 (Environmental claims), but did not find it in breach." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/response> "Severn Trent Water Ltd (Severn Trent) said that the ad made a limited claim regarding a specific aspect of their activities – planting trees ‒ and encouraged viewers to get involved. The claims in the ad were not retrospective and they did not believe that claims that related to current and future activities had to include historical information. The language used in the ad was clearly forward looking and stated that they were “working towards” a goal, which was followed by the specific activity (planting trees) which was helping them to achieve that. They believed that the reference to “Let’s do right by our environment” could not be taken out of the context of the planting of trees. The ads focus was on the trees they had already, and would in future, plant, and the call to action to viewers for them to get on board so that collectively they could do more. They did not believe that viewers would infer any form of broader environmental claim about Severn Trent’s overall impact on the environment or interpret the ad as relating to historic events. Not withstanding that the ad did not make any claims regarding river protection or waste management, they said they had joined with another water company to improve river health. They said that, in 2021, which was the most recent year for which data was available, they had received the highest four-star rating from the Environment Agency, and were one of the top performers of all water companies for preventing pollutions as measured by the Water Services Regulation Authority (OFWAT). When more storm and ground water entered the sewer system than the pipes were designed for, combined storm overflows (CSOs) acted as safety valves to stop homes and businesses from flooding after heavy rain. CSOs were widely constructed up until the 1970s and were common throughout Europe. The discharges they made were permitted and regulated by the Environment Agency so as not to have a detrimental impact on rivers. Discharges from CSOs were not raw sewage, the vast majority was rainwater. In rare instances where it was not rainwater, Severn Trent launched clean-up operations. Clearcast said that while the ad was focused on the work Severn Trent were doing for the environment, they nonetheless felt it was necessary to ask them what part they had or had not played in the river sewage pollution incidents that had been reported in the news around the time of the ad. Severn Trent provided them with details of the work they were doing to prevent pollution to the water system, including maintenance of storm overflows. They had been actively working to mitigate sewage dumping in rivers by upgrading the systems they maintained and increasing initiatives to prevent blockages from incorrect disposal of household waste into the sewer system, as well as looking into alternative ways to prevent flooding. They endorsed Severn Trent’s comments that they had been rated by OFWAT as one of the top performing water companies, and that the use of storm overflows was permitted by the Environment Agency. They understood that Severn Trent were working within the guidelines set by the Environment Agency with regards to any disposal of waste into the water system and were going beyond their obligation to do so with regards to their own target to improve water health and quality.

Upheld The CAP Code required that only nutrition claims authorised on the Great Britain Nutrition and Health Claims register were permitted in marketing communications. It defined a nutrition claim as any claim which stated, suggested or implied that a food (or drink) had particular beneficial nutritional properties due to the amount of calories, nutrients or other substances it contained, did not contain, or contained in reduced or increased proportions. The CAP Code further required that the only permitted nutrition claims that could be made in relation to alcohol were “low-alcohol”, “reduced alcohol” and “reduced energy”. However, the Code allowed that ads for alcoholic drinks could give factual information about product contents. The ASA acknowledged that it was permissible for advertisers to make factual numerical statements about the calorific content of an alcoholic drink, such as “57 calories”. However, we considered that by preceding that statement with the words “Our drinks only have”, ad (c) suggested that the product had the particular beneficial nutritional property of being low in calories (i.e. energy). The claim “Our drinks only have 57 calories” in ad (c) was therefore a nutrition claim equivalent to a ‘low calorie/energy nutrition claim’, which was not permitted in relation to alcohol. Similarly, we considered that by preceding the statement “57 cals” in ad (a) with a tick symbol, the ad suggested that the product had the particular beneficial nutritional property of being low in calories (i.e. energy). The claim “[tick symbol] 57 cals” in ad (a) was therefore a nutrition claim equivalent to a ‘low calorie/energy nutrition claim’, which was not permitted in relation to alcohol. We also considered that the claim “0g Sugar” in ad (c), when read in the context of the sentence as a whole, alongside the claim, “the perfect tipple without all the guilt” suggested that the product had a particular beneficial nutritional property because it did not contain sugar. The nutrition claim ‘sugars-free’ could be made in relation to foods or drinks which met the associated conditions of use for the claim, but it was not a nutrition claim that was permitted to be made in relation to alcohol. Because the ads included nutrition claims that the product was low in calories and contained no sugar, which were not permitted nutrition claims for alcohol products, we concluded that they breached the Code. On that point, ads (a) and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule15.1.115.1.1Only nutrition claims listed in the applicable register may be used in marketing communications.Only health claims listed as authorised in the applicable register, or claims that would have the same meaning to the consumer, may be used in marketing communications.(Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and18.1718.17Marketing communications may give factual information about product contents, including comparisons, but must not make any health, fitness or weight-control claims.The only permitted nutrition claims are \"low-alcohol\", \"reduced alcohol\" and \"reduced energy\" and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer.(Alcohol). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that ads for alcoholic drinks must not make any health, fitness or weight-control claims. Health claims were defined as those which stated, suggested or implied that a relationship existed between a food or drink or one of its constituents and health. That included references to general benefits of a food or drink for overall good health or health-related well-being. We considered that the claim, “If you’re like me, you love a drink but also enjoy an active lifestyle. My delicious alcoholic sparkling water is the best of both worlds” in ad (a) was a general health claim because it implied the product was beneficial for overall good health or health-related well-being. We considered that the claim, “You guys know I love a drink, but I also really care about my well-being” in ad (b) was a general health claim, because it suggested the product was beneficial for health-related well-being. Because such health claims were not permitted for alcoholic drinks, we concluded that the ads breached the Code. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules15.1.115.1.1Only nutrition claims listed in the applicable register may be used in marketing communications.Only health claims listed as authorised in the applicable register, or claims that would have the same meaning to the consumer, may be used in marketing communications.(Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and18.1718.17Marketing communications may give factual information about product contents, including comparisons, but must not make any health, fitness or weight-control claims.The only permitted nutrition claims are \"low-alcohol\", \"reduced alcohol\" and \"reduced energy\" and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer.(Alcohol). 3. Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications must not imply that alcohol might be indispensable or take priority in life or that drinking alcohol could overcome boredom, loneliness or other problems. We considered that the phrase, “Is dry January becoming a little dry?”, would be likely to be interpreted by consumers to mean “Is dry January becoming a little boring or tedious?”. We noted that further text in the ad stated, “Forget Dry January” and “There’s no reason you can’t enjoy a drink without setting you back!” and considered that text was encouraging consumers who were doing Dry January to consume alcohol before the end of the month. We considered that the overall impression of the ad was that consumers were invited to drink alcohol to overcome the boredom or tedium of Dry January. We therefore concluded that the ad implied that drinking alcohol could overcome boredom and therefore breached the Code. On that point, ad (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule18.618.6Marketing communications must not imply that alcohol might be indispensable or take priority in life or that drinking alcohol can overcome boredom, loneliness or other problems.(Alcohol). 4. Not upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications must be socially responsible and must contain nothing that was likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinking that were unwise. We considered that although ad (d) referenced “day drinking”, the female in the image was shown with one drink in her hand and no other drinks were visible, which we considered suggested she was drinking responsibly and not to excess. She was shown relaxing in an outdoor environment and had her eyes closed, as though she was daydreaming (as referenced in the ad), which suggested she was enjoying time to herself. There was no suggestion that she was using alcohol as a means of escaping her responsibilities, such as work. We therefore did not consider the reference to day drinking in that context would be likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinking that were unwise. We considered that the statement in ad (e), ““Mid-week drinking season has arrived [heart emoji] [Christmas tree emoji]” would be understood by consumers to refer to the increase in mid-week social events during the festive season. We noted that the man in ad (e) was holding one single drink and no other drinks were visible in the image. We considered that he was not depicted as drinking irresponsibly or to excess. We therefore did not consider the reference to mid-week drinking in that context would be likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinking that were unwise. For those reasons, we considered the ads were not irresponsible or likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinking that were unwise. We investigated ads (d) and (e) under CAP Code (Edition 12) rule18.118.1Marketing communications must be socially responsible and must contain nothing that is likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinking that are unwise. For example, they should not encourage excessive drinking. Care should be taken not to exploit the young, the immature or those who are mentally or socially vulnerable.but did not find them in breach." ;

Served Drinks understood that the CAP Code allowed advertisers to provide factual information about the nutritional content of their products, including the calorific content, provided that there was no suggestion that the drink had the particular beneficial property of being low in calories. They said that ad (a) had a list of three factual statements about the product, separated from the rest of the body copy, with a tick symbol next to the words “57 cals”. They believed that was a statement of fact about the nutritional content of the product, which was not prefaced by words such as “only” or “just”. They said they were aware of guidance issued by the ASA and CAP that phrases such as “zero sugar” should not be used. They accepted that the phrase “zero sugar” was a claim, rather than a statement of fact, not least because there was no reference to a unit of measurement. However, they believed ‘0g sugar’ was not a nutritional claim, but an accurate statement of fact that did not make a health, fitness or weight-control claim. They said that they had withdrawn ad (c) and acknowledged that the word “only” should not be used in conjunction with a statement about the number of calories in a product. They said they would avoid using phrases such as “only 57 calories” in future. They believed the reference to “0g sugar” was not a claim, but simply a statement of fact. They said within the phrase “our drinks only have 57 calories, 0g Sugar”, the word “only” was an adjective used to describe the number of calories, not the amount of sugar. 2. Served Drinks understood that a general health claim was defined in the CAP Code as a reference to a general benefit of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health-related well-being. They said the words in ads (a) and (b) were not used to describe a benefit of their product, but to describe the influencer’s preferences and lifestyle, and what was important to her - that she both enjoyed consuming alcohol and having an active lifestyle and taking care of her well-being, as well as being environmentally responsible. They believed the words that she used could not reasonably be interpreted as being about the product itself and were therefore not general health claims. 3. Served Drinks believed the timing of ad (c), on 18 January, almost three weeks into Dry January, did not support the proposition that it suggested drinking alcohol was indispensable. They pointed out that the artwork showed a can of Served, with half a grapefruit and two glasses of the drink, garnished with ice, a slice of grapefruit and sprig of rosemary, which suggested that the drink would be consumed by two people together in a sociable environment. They said there was nothing in the words or images used to suggest that alcohol could overcome boredom or that the ad was targeted at an individual who was bored and alone. They understood that the CAP Advice Online entry on “Alcohol: Boredom and loneliness” expressly stated that a reference to Dry January was not always or inherently problematic, but that in many cases it would be, since the intended effect from alcohol marketers would often be that Dry January or sobriety was difficult or boring. They believed the phrase “Is dry January becoming a little dry?” was simply a play on words and was a modest reference that could not reasonably be said to claim that alcohol was indispensable and could overcome boredom. They believed that the combination of the timing of the ad, the imagery and the wording meant that it was on the right side of the line. They believed if the complaint was Upheld, it would be hard to conceive of circumstances in which a reference to Dry January would be permissible. 4. They pointed out that in ad (d) a woman was shown holding a single can of Served, and no other cans of Served were visible in the ad. Whilst there was a reference to “day drinking”, there was nothing in the image to suggest that the woman was intoxicated. Although the woman was drinking during the day, she was drinking responsibly. They were not aware of anything in the CAP Code that suggested it was irresponsible to refer to people drinking alcohol during the day, and they believed there were lots of examples of alcohol ads across all media which showed people drinking during the day. They said ad (e) showed a man holding one can of Served, and there were no other cans of Served in the shot. The man was looking confidently into the camera and appeared entirely sober. They said there was a reference to the mid-week drinking season, but noted the post appeared on 8 December, and included both a heart and a Christmas tree emoji to indicate that it was a reference to the festive season, when people socialised during the week, as well as at the weekend. They said there was nothing in the ad which implied or condoned drinking to excess. They were not aware of anything in the CAP Code that suggested alcohol should only be shown being drunk at the weekend." ;

Upheld The ASA acknowledged that the poster showed an obscured version of the word “Fuck”; that it had been placed in accordance with guidelines on proximity to schools and religious buildings; that the ad had run during school summer holidays and that one local authority (Newcastle City Council) had been asked and considered the ad acceptable for use. Nevertheless, we considered it would be clear to most of those who saw it that the ad referred to the word “Fuck” in the context of the expression “Fuck you” and was making a pun, in reference to the impact of climate change. We considered the word “Fuck” was so likely to offend a general audience that such a reference should not appear in media where it was viewable by such an audience. We therefore concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious and widespread offence and was not appropriate for display in untargeted media. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules1.31.3Marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society.(Responsible advertising) and4.14.1Marketing communications must not contain anything that is likely to cause serious or widespread offence. Particular care must be taken to avoid causing offence on the grounds of: age; disability; gender; gender reassignment; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity; race; religion or belief; sex; and sexual orientation. Compliance will be judged on the context, medium, audience, product and prevailing standards.Marketing communications may be distasteful without necessarily breaching this rule. Marketers are urged to consider public sensitivities before using potentially offensive material.The fact that a product is offensive to some people is not grounds for finding a marketing communication in breach of the Code.(Harm and offence). 2. Upheld (in respect of Metro only) We acknowledged that most readers of Metro were adult. We considered that many would accept that the ad was using a play on words to make a statement about environmental issues as part of its marketing message. Nevertheless, as a widely available, free newspaper, the ad was untargeted. Although the ad intended to use a pun to get its message across, we considered it would be clear to most readers that it referred to the word “Fuck”, a word that was likely to be considered unacceptable by many readers in untargeted media. We also considered the expression the ad referred to “Fuck you” ? was likely to be associated with an aggressive tone. We concluded therefore that the ad was likely to cause serious and widespread offence in Metro and was not appropriate for use in that publication. We considered, however, that an obscured version of the word “Fuck” reflected similar use of language elsewhere in The Week and The Economist and, in light of the ad’s intended message, was not out of place. We also acknowledged these publications were not free and had to be actively purchased in a shop or by subscription. While some readers might have found it distasteful, we considered it was unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence in those publications. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules1.31.3Marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society.(Responsible advertising) and4.14.1Marketing communications must not contain anything that is likely to cause serious or widespread offence.

BrewDog plc said they had wanted to shock people into thinking about the planet and reducing and removing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. They said the billboard hosts and media print titles were aligned with their objectives and message and that The Economist, The Week and Metro recognised that the message would be understood by their readers and were happy to run the ad. They said every media placement and poster site had been approved by the media owner or landlord and that every poster site had been planned in accordance with guidelines on proximity to schools and religious buildings as advised by Outsmart. BrewDog said they had consulted a broader range of outdoor contractors and had consulted with them on the campaign and its environmental message versus the potential for offence. They said the campaign had run at a time when schools were closed for the summer holidays and so any exposure to the ad by children going to or from school would have been limited. BrewDog said the ads implied a swear word but that it was not explicitly stated, which they believed followed precedent of what was acceptable. They did not believe the message would have caused harm or offence. Metro said they had believed the ad was suitable for their readers because 98% of them were over 18 years of age. They said one in two Metro readers said humorous content made for good advertising and that 75% of Metro readers were concerned about the environment. No complaints had been made directly to them. The Week said they considered the ad with the obscured text to be in line with their editorial policy and was unlikely to be inappropriate for their readers, whom they considered to be intelligent and curious. They said the average age of their readers was 52 years and that 96% of them received the magazine via subscription. The Economist said they had considered the ad with their editorial team before publishing it. They said there was no ban on swearwords in The Economist, but they did not use them often. They acknowledged that some readers might find the ad distasteful, but did not consider it would be offensive or harmful to either adults or children. They said The Economist was not targeted at children and did not knowingly sell subscriptions to customers under 18 years of age. They said that while it was possible that some children might have access to the magazine, those who would read it were likely to be teenagers and therefore unlikely to find the ad offensive. They had received one complaint made directly to them on grounds of taste. City Outdoor noted that the word was obscured. They said they had asked Newcastle City Council for their view on running the ad on the Northumberland Street screen. Newcastle City Council considered the content to be acceptable. City Outdoor took from that, that other local councils would have a similar view. They said there were relatively few people passing by because of the Coronavirus situation." ;

A website for ArtificialGrass.com, www.artificialgrass.com, stated “Introducing AIR Our new eco-friendly artificial grass … 1m2 of AIR treated grass is comparable to the air purifying effects of one mature tree … Our innovative AIR range uses technology capable of reducing up to 70% of harmful NOX by oxidising organic components and malodours at molecular level, helping to cultivate a sustainable, cleaner environment”. b. A YouTube video, posted on ArtificialGrass.com’s channel, included on-screen text which stated “Introducing AIR, from award winning ArtificialGrass.com an eco-friendly, air purifying … artificial grass solution” and “… the AIR artificial grass range is able to reduce nitrogen oxides by 70 percent. One metre squared of AIR treated grass is comparable to the air purifying effects of one mature tree. Considering an average garden lawn covers a 50 square metre area, it’s the equivalent of planting 50 fully grown trees in your own back yard”. c.

                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1. Upheld The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear and that unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information. It required that absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. It also said that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise. The ASA considered the claim “eco-friendly” was absolute, and in the absence of further context or qualification, would be understood to mean AIR artificial grass was not harmful to the environment in any way, throughout the full life cycle of the product. We therefore expected to see evidence that demonstrated the grass was not harmful to the environment at any point during its full life cycle. We acknowledged Evergreens’ comments that they had received an initial draft of the full environmental impact of AIR artificial grass from ESTC and would update their advertising accordingly once the full draft had been received. We also acknowledged their comments regarding their transition to using more efficient transportation, as well as pursuing UK-based recycling facilities. However, we understood the artificial grass was made from plastic. We considered that, even if it was transported efficiently and recycled at the end of its life cycle, the extraction of raw materials and subsequent processing of those materials in order to produce the artificial grass had a negative impact on the environment. We welcomed Evergreen’s assurance that they would amend their advertising to make more limited claims about specific aspects of the product. However, because at the time the ads appeared they had featured the claim “eco-friendly”, and because we had not seen evidence regarding the full life cycle of the product, we considered the claim “eco-friendly” overstated the environmental benefit of the product and was therefore misleading. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation),11.111.1The basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.11.311.3Absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. Comparative claims such as \"greener\" or \"friendlier\" can be justified, for example, if the advertised product provides a total environmental benefit over that of the marketer's previous product or competitor products and the basis of the comparison is clear.and11.411.4Marketers must base environmental claims on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the marketing communication states otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle. If a general claim cannot be justified, a more limited claim about specific aspects of a product might be justifiable. Marketers must ensure claims that are based on only part of the advertised product's life cycle do not mislead consumers about the product's total environmental impact.(Environmental claims). 2. Upheld We considered the claim “capable of reducing up to 70% of harmful NOX” in ad (a) would be likely to be understood by consumers to mean that in certain circumstances AIR artificial grass could remove 70% of NOx from the air in the area where it was installed. We considered the claim in ads (b) and (c) that the product was “able to reduce nitrogen oxides by 70 percent” would be likely to be interpreted to mean that it was able to reduce NOx by 70% in all environments. We assessed the evidence provided by Evergreens. We noted that only one piece of evidence provided examined the use of PURETi on artificial grass; the majority of the evidence focused on the use of PURETi on buildings and pavements in urban settings. We considered because that evidence was not focused on the use of PURETi on artificial grass specifically, it was therefore not relevant to the claims under investigation. The remaining piece of evidence, a brochure for artificial grass sports pitches enriched with PURETi, featured excerpts from a lab report. The excerpt showed that an NOx conversion of 49% had been observed in a small sample of artificial grass treated with PURETi. The brochure claimed that on a larger scale, that figure could increase to 85%. We had not seen a full copy of the report from which the figures were drawn. Based on the available information, we noted that the testing had been conducted on a small sample of artificial grass under laboratory conditions, and considered that the observed reduction in NOx was significantly below the 70% reduction claimed in the ads. We therefore considered the brochure was not adequate substation for the claims. For those reasons we concluded that the claims “capable of reducing up to 70% of harmful NOX” in ad (a) and “able to reduce nitrogen oxides by 70 percent” in ads (b) and (c) had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising) and3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation). 3. Upheld We considered the claims “1m2of AIR treated grass is comparable to the air purifying effects of one mature tree” in ad (a), and “One metre squared of AIR treated grass is comparable to the air purifying effects of one mature tree” in ads (b) and (c) would be understood to mean that, once installed, one square metre of AIR artificial grass had the same ability as one mature tree to remove and breakdown greenhouse gasses, and other pollutants, from the air in the area where it was installed. We assessed the evidence provided by Evergreens: two studies and a best practice document focused on the impact of trees on air pollution, and a further study on the use of PURETi in mitigating livestock odours. The first study examined the removal of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ozone, and PM10 by urban trees and shrubs in 55 cities across the USA. The second study examined the NO2assimilation of NO2by 70 different species of tree, under laboratory conditions. The best practice document laid out guidance for Green Infrastructure implementation and made recommendations for using trees, shrubs, and hedges to improve urban air quality. The final study focused on the use of PURETi in mitigating livestock odours. We considered that the first two studies and best practice document focused on the impact of trees on improving air quality, but did not show that AIR artificial grass had the same air purifying abilities as a mature tree. The other study focused solely on livestock odours and made no comment on greenhouse gasses. For those reasons, we considered the documents provided were not relevant to the claims under investigation and were therefore inadequate substantiation. We concluded that the claims “1m2of AIR treated grass is comparable to the air purifying effects of one mature tree” in ad (a) and “One metre squared of AIR treated grass is comparable to the air purifying effects of one mature tree” in ads (b) and (c) had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

They said that their AIR range of products could breakdown odours, moss, algae and contribute to improving air quality. 1. Evergreens said that they understood the need to demonstrate that their products had a net positive environmental impact over their full life cycles in order to use claims such as “eco-friendly”. They had received an initial draft of the full environmental impact of the product from the European Synthetic Turf Council (ESTC) and would update their advertising accordingly once the full draft had been received. In the meantime, they would amend their advertising to make more limited claims about specific aspects of the product. They said that they were in the process of transitioning towards “greener” production methods using more efficient transportation, as well as actively pursuing potential UK-based recycling facilities. 2. Evergreens said their AIR artificial grass had been treated with PURETi, a titanium dioxide (TiO2) containing, water-based photocatalytic surface treatment. They explained that UV light, oxygen and humidity reacted with PURETi to create cleaning agents, such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions. Those substances converted pollutants such as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) into harmless mineral nitrates, water, and a small amount of residual carbon dioxide (CO2). They said PURETi actively and continuously reduced the indirect greenhouse gasses, NOx and SOx (sulphur oxide), and fine particulate matters (PM) 2.5 and 10. They provided four published studies, two unpublished studies, two conference papers, two project reports, a lab test report, a website, and three documents from the manufacturer of PURETi in support of the claim that AIR could reduce NOx in the air by up to 70%, and on the efficacy of PURETi in reducing NOx levels. 3. Evergreens explained that one square metre of AIR could neutralise 188 kg of NOx per year. They provided two studies and a best practice document on the pollution reduction achieved by trees and said that although trees were proven to reduce CO2, they were less effective at reducing NOx and ultra-fine pollutants from traffic exhausts, such as PM 2.5, PM5 and PM10. They said the expected lifespan of AIR was approximately eight years, and that during that time it was 10 to 25 times more photo-catalytically effective than conventional catalysts. They provided one study as evidence. Evergreens said the area quoted in the ads, “one square metre”, was conservative and that actual NOx reduction by one square metre of AIR could in some instances equate to the planting of three trees, dependent on tree species, temperature, relative humidity and meteorological conditions. They had used the claim “one metre square” to offset emissions from the production, removal and end-of-life recycling processes. They said PURETi and AIR performance outweighed NOx reductions by trees." ;

The MPF alleges that the defendant's occupation of the land was unlawful, as it is part of an Agroextractivist Settlement Project (Projeto de Assentamento Agroextrativista - PAE), owned by and of interest to the Federal Union, managed by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA), and occupied by traditional extractivist communities. This ACP is part of a set of 22 actions filed by the MPF following an investigation conducted under Civil Inquiry No. 1.13.000.001719/2015-49, concerning illegal deforestation within the Antimary Agroextractivist Settlement Project (PAE), but involving different defendants. The claims in the action are based, among other points, on Brazilian Environmental Law, particularly the constitutional protection of the environment, allegations of deforestation, strict liability (responsabilidade civil propter rem) for environmental damages—including climate-related damages—and collective moral damages. The claim also identifies unauthorized greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the illegal deforestation as environmental liabilities. These emissions, calculated at 84,681.52 tons of carbon dioxide, are directly linked to Brazil's deviation from its climate goals, conflicting with the country’s national and international commitments under the National Policy on Climate Change (Federal Law No. 12,187/2009) and the Paris Agreement." ;

The poster, seen in Bristol on 20 June 2022, featured large text that stated, “BRISTOL is READY for Cleaner Energy” superimposed over a cityscape shot of Bristol. The Shell logo (a red and yellow coloured shell) appeared in the top right-hand corner of the poster. Further text at the bottom of the poster stated, “In the South West 78,000 homes use 100% renewable electricity from Shell Energy” above smaller text that stated, “Shell Energy’s renewable electricity is supplied by the National Grid and certified by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin, matching electricity bought with the equivalent amount from 100% renewable sources”. b. The TV ad, seen on 14 June 2022, opened with a man stating, “In the UK, 1.4 million households use 100% renewable electricity from Shell” as he helped a young child to cycle down the street. The scene that followed depicted two offshore engineers working on-site at a beach. The one facing the camera stated “Shell experts are working on a wind project that could power six million homes” as animated design plans for wind turbines popped up on the horizon. The ad then depicted an electric car driving into a rural town before its driver stated, “Nearly one in five new cars now plug in” as he plugged his car into a charging point. A woman out walking her dog then stated, “These chargers are popping up on our streets” before a man fitting an EV charging point added, “Shell aims to fit 50,000 chargers nationwide by 2025”. An employee at a Shell petrol and electric vehicle charging station then stated, “And with more electric car charge points coming to Shell forecourts near you, the UK is ready for Cleaner energy.” Throughout the ad, large individual letters appeared in the background of successive scenes to spell the word “READY”. The video ended with large on-screen text “The UK is READY for Cleaner Energy” followed by the Shell logo and the hashtag “#PoweringProgress”. Superimposed text that appeared on-screen during the ad’s opening shots stated “Shell Energy’s renewable electricity is supplied by the National Grid and certified by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin, matching electricity bought with the equivalent amount from 100% renewable sources”. c. The YouTube video, posted on Shell’s YouTube channel on 9 June 2022, was titled “The UK is READY For Cleaner Energy” and included text in its caption that stated, “From electric vehicle charging to renewable electricity for your home, Shell is giving customers more low-carbon choices and helping drive the UK’s energy transition. The UK is ready for cleaner energy. Learn more: https://go.shell.com/399dfw2. #PoweringProgress”. The video was identical to ad (b)." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1. Upheld The ASA acknowledged that consumers were likely to understand that energy products derived from fossil fuels were environmentally detrimental. We further acknowledged that many consumers would closely associate Shell with petrol sales, and more broadly understand that the company was involved in oil and gas investment and extraction. However, they would also have an awareness that many companies in carbon-intensive industries, including the oil and gas sector, aimed to dramatically reduce their emissions in response to the climate crisis. We considered that consumers were increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of activities related to higher-carbon products and services, and would be interested in seeking out businesses, including oil and gas companies, that were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services. However, they were unlikely to be aware of the details of this in relation to specific companies, and ads were therefore likely to mislead consumers if they misrepresented the contribution that lower-carbon initiatives played, or would play in the near future, as part of the overall balance of a company's activities. We assessed the ads on that basis.Ad (a) featured the claim “BRISTOL is READY for Cleaner Energy” in large text, which was accompanied by text at the bottom of the ad, that read “In the South-West 78,000 homes use 100% renewable electricity from Shell Energy”. The Shell logo appeared in the top right-hand corner of the poster. We acknowledged that the claims in the ad referred specifically to “Shell Energy”, as opposed to “Shell”, and referred to a single area of Shell’s business activities, namely those related to its role as a domestic electricity provider in the South-West of England. However, we did not consider that consumers would draw a distinction between “Shell” and “Shell Energy”, particularly because Shell was a brand well known for its energy products in a more general sense. We considered that the use of the Shell logo, the ad’s focus on the claim “BRISTOL is READY for Cleaner Energy” (emphasis on “READY”) and the other claim focusing on the number of existing customers meant that consumers would interpret the ad as making a broader claim about Shell as a whole providing cleaner energy, and featuring one illustrative example of Shell’s environmental credentials rather than as a narrow claim about one specific product offering. We considered the overall impression of the ad was that low-carbon energy products comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Shell invested in and sold in the UK in 2022, or were likely to do so in the near future. Ads (b) and (c) depicted some of Shell’s business activities in 2022 and focused on more environmentally friendly energy products. The ads included the claims: “In the UK, 1.4 million households use 100% renewable electricity from Shell”; “Shell experts are working on a wind project that could power six million homes”; and “Shell aims to fit 50,000 [electric vehicle] chargers nationwide by 2025”. The claims “The UK is READY for cleaner energy” and hashtag “#PoweringProgress” appeared on-screen in the closing shots of the ads, together with the Shell logo and “Shell International”. We considered that, in the absence of qualifying information, the cumulative effect of the claims relating to applications or sources of lower-carbon energy that spanned distinct and diverse areas of Shell’s operations, together with the claim “The UK is READY for Cleaner Energy”, which was immediately followed by the Shell logo, was to give the impression that low-carbon energy products comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Shell invested in and sold in the UK in 2022, or were likely to do so in the near future. In addition, the YouTube ad (c) included the caption “From electric vehicle charging to renewable electricity for your home, Shell is giving customers more low-carbon choices and helping drive the UK’s energy transition ...”. We considered the caption reinforced that impression. We acknowledged Shell’s comment that, rather than being an explicit claim about Shell, the claim “The UK is READY for cleaner energy” in ads (b) and (c) was intended as a forward-looking statement about the UK-wide demand for less environmentally detrimental energy sources. However, in the context of the claim’s appearance in an ad for Shell, a well-known provider of energy products, we considered that consumers were likely to interpret the claim as being, in part, a claim about Shell’s own products and capacity to deliver low-carbon energy. We also considered that the emphasis the ads placed on “READY”, as well as the fact that the only timeframe mentioned by the ads was short-term, implied that lower-carbon energy products, like those shown in the ads, already comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Shell invested in and sold in the UK, or were likely to do so in the near future. We acknowledged that “#PoweringProgress” in ad (c) referred to the name of Shell’s “Powering Progress” strategy through which the business aimed to achieve its target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. However, we considered that consumers were unlikely to recognise it as such. Instead, we considered that the claim reinforced the impression given by the ad’s preceding scenes that, not only was there immediate UK-wide demand for energy products that were less environmentally detrimental than those derived from fossil fuels, but that Shell’s business activities in 2022 were such that the company was already well-placed to meet that demand by providing “cleaner energy”, thereby “powering progress”. We acknowledged that Shell said they were taking steps towards net zero and promoting sustainable energy. However, according to Shell’s 2021 Sustainability Report, Shell’s operations gave rise to greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 that were estimated as equivalent to 1375 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. While that estimate did not capture Shell’s absolute emissions in 2021, given that it included deductions linked to carbon offsets and did not cover certain commercial contracts, it nonetheless represented a large contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. We understood that large-scale oil and gas investment and extraction comprised the vast majority of the company’s business model in 2022 and would continue to do so in the near future. We therefore considered that, because ads (a), (b) and (c) gave the overall impression that a significant proportion of Shell’s business comprised lower-carbon energy products, further information about the proportion of Shell’s overall business model that comprised lower-carbon energy products was material information that should have been included. Because the ads did not include such information, we concluded that they omitted material information and were likely to mislead. On this point, ads (a) and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 11.1 (Environmental claims) and ad (b) breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 and 3.2 (Misleading advertising) and 9.2 (Environmental claims). 2. Not upheld The ASA noted that, since 2021, the UK Government had been conducting a review of ‘green’ electricity tariffs. That review was partly concerned with the question of whether Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) were adequate to ensure transparency regarding the provenance of the electricity associated with particular tariffs. Nevertheless, we understood that, at the time the ad appeared, the regulatory regime in the UK continued to allow domestic electricity providers to account for renewable energy supplied to consumers by holding REGOs, including by purchasing them via a third-party marketplace. We understood the complainant was concerned that the claim “In the South West 78,000 homes use 100% renewable electricity from Shell Energy” in ad (a), and the claim “In the UK, 1.4 million households use 100% renewable electricity from Shell” in ads (b) and (c), misrepresented the number of homes in each region that purchased 100% renewable electricity from Shell Energy, and implied that Shell Energy directly supplied energy to the claimed number of homes in each region. We considered that consumers would understand the claims to mean that the number of homes specified in each ad used electricity supplied under a domestic energy tariff by Shell, and that the electricity supplied was classed as 100% renewable. We understood that most electricity generated from renewable sources was distributed through the National Grid. The amount of electricity taken from the National Grid by consumers of renewable electricity products was equal to the amount of electricity fed into the National Grid from renewable sources. The customer data that Shell had provided substantiated that the number of homes subscribed to their 100% renewable energy tariff in each region exceeded the claimed figure. Ofgem’s REGO certified that energy purchased via Shell’s 100% renewable electricity tariff was exclusively derived from renewable sources. For those reasons, we considered that the ads were not likely to mislead in relation to the number of households that purchased 100% renewable electricity from Shell. Regarding how the electricity was supplied, each ad referred to the intermediacy of the National Grid with text that stated, “Shell Energy’s renewable electricity is supplied by the National Grid and certified by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin, matching electricity bought with the equivalent amount from 100% renewable sources”. In ads (b) and (c), that text featured on-screen for the entire duration of the ads’ opening shots. In ad (a), the text was included directly underneath the main claim. Because of the inclusion of this information, we did not consider that the ads implied that the electricity generated from renewable sources was delivered directly and only to Shell’s green energy tariff customers. Because Shell had substantiated the claimed figures, and the ads made clear that the electricity was supplied via the National Grid rather than directly, we concluded that the ads were not likely to mislead. On this point we investigated ads (a) and (c) under CAP Code rules 3.1, 3.3 and 3.7 (Misleading advertising) and 11.1 (Environmental claims), but did not find them in breach. We also investigated ad (b) under BCAP Code rules 3.1, 3.2 and 3.9 (Misleading advertising) and 9.2 (Environmental claims), but did not find it in breach." ;

                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/response> "1. Shell UK Ltd stated that their intent with the ads was to raise consumer awareness of, and increase demand for, the range of lower emissions energy products and services they offered, the availability of which was increasing through continued investment. They believed that the ads accurately represented those products and services and did not omit material information about their more environmentally detrimental energy products, such as petrol. Consumers would already be well-informed regarding that aspect of their operations and, in fact, would primarily associate their brand with the sale of petrol. Recent market research conducted by an independent third-party company supported that 83% of consumers did so, and also suggested that a much smaller proportion were familiar with Shell’s lower-carbon energy products and services, including renewable electricity and electric vehicle (EV) charging. Shell hoped to bridge that gap in consumers’ knowledge by providing clear and accurate information about their newer products. Achieving that would be an essential step towards realising the business’s overarching aim of helping customers transition towards lower-emissions energy sources. Particularly because of their finding that petrol sales remained the most visible part of their brand to consumers, they believed that consumers were very unlikely to assume that the ads’ content covered the full range of Shell’s business activities. In line with that, they thought there was a low risk of the ads delivering the misleading impression that they were representative of the total environmental impact associated with Shell’s operations. Because the ads’ purpose was to promote low-carbon energy, they believed that any mention of high-carbon Shell products would have been counterproductive. Information about those Shell products would have only served to highlight their existence and availability, and thereby dilute the impact of the ads’ positive environmental message. In addition, it would be disproportionate and unworkable for regulators to require businesses with diverse product portfolios to ensure that ads, the primary purpose of which was usually to promote a specific range of products, always provided a representative overview of the advertiser’s business as a whole. Shell explained that, through use of the hashtag “#PoweringProgress”, ads (b) and (c) called attention to Shell’s Powering Progress strategy, which was central to their objective of playing a leading role in helping society meet the challenges of climate change. As part of that strategy, Shell’s commitment in relation to their own operations was to become a net-zero energy business by 2050. In addition, they aimed to expand on the 13,000 EV charging points they provided in 2022 by increasing that number to 100,000 by 2030. They emphasised that the achievement of such aims would be heavily contingent on improving consumers’ awareness of their less environmentally detrimental energy products. Shell neither believed that the ads misrepresented the overall environmental impact of their business activities, nor that the ads omitted significant information about that impact. They highlighted that ad (a) gave specific information about the number of Shell Energy customers in Bristol who received renewable electricity. On that basis, they believed consumers were unlikely to view it as relevant to the total environmental impact associated with the full range of Shell’s business activities. They stated that ad (a) was instead likely to deliver the narrower impression that the carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the renewable energy Shell provided to 78,000 homes in Bristol were lower than the emissions associated with the average UK fuel mix (i.e., a mix which incorporated fossil fuels). They also stated that consumers would likely understand that the ad only went so far as to position Shell’s renewable electricity sales as part of a strategy to aid customers’ transition away from higher-emissions products. Shell also believed that consumers were unlikely to regard the selection of environmentally motivated initiatives referred to and championed in ads (b) and (c) as a representative sample of the full range of Shell’s business activities. Not only would consumers have recognised that those ads did not mention Shell’s high-carbon products such as petrol, but they were also unlikely to regard the set of initiatives depicted as having a wide enough scope to comprise anything resembling a representative cross-section of Shell’s business model. In particular, they would note that the ads’ content was solely focused on the delivery of electricity to UK consumers, and understand that Shell’s activities in that regard constituted a relatively minor part of their overall business. In line with that, they believed consumers were unlikely to infer that the ad intended to send any message whatsoever regarding the overall environmental impact or balance of Shell’s operations. Instead, they stated that consumers would interpret the ads as merely emphasising that Shell Energy supplied renewable electricity to UK homes, that Shell was involved in the development of offshore windfarms, and that, in line with their aim to increase potential EV purchasers’ confidence in the availability of chargers, Shell was in the process of rapidly expanding its existing EV charging infrastructure. Consumers would understand that such activities were consistent with Shell’s overarching environmental aims. Shell stated that the claim “BRISTOL IS READY FOR CLEANER ENERGY” in ad (a), as well as the similar claim “THE UK IS READY FOR CLEANER ENERGY” in ads (b) and (c), would be recognised as a forward looking statement regarding the potential of certain Shell products to provide consumers with energy that contributed lower greenhouse gas emissions than energy from non-renewable sources. They emphasised their view that neither the claims themselves, nor the ads as a whole, featured anything to imply Shell exclusively or predominantly supplied renewable or low emissions energy. Instead, the ads merely highlighted that Shell already supplied lower-carbon energy products to some UK consumers. Clearcast, responding in relation to the TV ad (b) only, believed that the ad did not misrepresent the overall environmental impact of Shell’s operations by stating or implying that impact was not negative. That was because ad (b) made clear that it did not seek to provide a holistic view of Shell’s environmental impact in 2022. Instead, the ad gave an overview of environmentally motivated initiatives running in areas of Shell’s business that were specifically concerned with the generation and supply of low-carbon electricity, while inviting consumers to transition towards less environmentally detrimental energy sources. They understood the tagline “The UK is ready for cleaner energy” as referring to a society-wide appetite for less environmentally detrimental energy products, and further stated that it did not emphasise or explicitly relate to Shell’s overall impact, nor even to any environmental benefits of the initiatives featured in ad (b). In addition, the claim “Nearly one in five new cars now plug in” drew focus to the important role that individual consumers’ behavioural changes would play in the fight against climate change. On that basis, they believed the claim suggested there was a limit to what Shell could achieve without consumers’ co-operation. They supported Shell’s view that consumers’ awareness of Shell’s petrol sales would mitigate any risk of ad (b) delivering the misleading impression that it was representative of the overall environmental impact of Shell’s business activities. In particular, ad (b)’s reference to, and visuals depicting, a Shell “forecourt” would specifically bring the company’s fossil-fuel based energy products to mind. 2. Shell said that the claim in ad (a) and the similar claims in ads (b) and (c) were substantiated by customer data they provided. They also believed that the qualifying text in each ad, “Shell Energy’s renewable electricity is supplied by the National Grid and certified by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin, matching electricity bought with the equivalent amount from 100% renewable sources” was prominent enough to make the intermediacy of the National Grid clear. On that basis, the ads did not suggest that Shell’s renewable energy was supplied to customers directly. Shell believed that the claim in ad (a), “In the South West 78,000 homes use 100% renewable electricity from Shell Energy”, gave the impression that 78,000 homes in the South West of England purchased 100% renewable electricity from Shell Energy. The qualifying text made the intermediacy of the National Grid clear, meaning the ad gave the overall impression that, while electricity was supplied by the National Grid, the energy consumed by the claimed number of homes was accounted for by an equivalent amount of exclusively renewable energy that Shell Energy purchased. Shell said that the claim in ads (b) and (c), “In the UK, 1.4 million households use 100% renewable electricity from Shell” gave the impression that 1.4 million homes across the UK were subscribed to Shell’s 100% renewable energy tariff. Because the qualifying text made the intermediacy of the National Grid clear, viewers would not have the misleading impression that Shell Energy supplied energy directly to those customers. The customer data indicated that, in April 2022, in the South West of England 78,507 households were subscribed to Shell Energy’s 100% renewable electricity tariff. It also indicated that 1,403,357 households across the UK were subscribed to the same tariff. Every unit of the electricity provided to those customers was certified as renewable by the electricity and gas regulator Ofgem’s Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs). In relation to the TV ad (b) only, Clearcast supported Shell’s response on this point." ;

The emission of this by-product has 14,800 times more global warming potential (being a greenhouse gas) compared to carbon dioxide thereby leading to ozone depletion. The excessive release of greenhouse gas may set off a climate bomb and severely affect the environment. The petitioner relied on constitutional mandates, namely Articles 48A (duty of the state to protect the environment), 51A(g) (fundamental duty of the citizen to protect and improve the environment), and section 3 of the Environment Protection Act 1986 that give powers to Central Government to take such measures as deemed necessary or expedient for the purpose of protecting and improving quality of the environment and preventing, controlling and abating environmental pollution. However, the respondent, namely, the Ministry of Environment and Forests raised a preliminary objection by stating that the petition is unmaintainable as it falls outside the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal. The bye-product HFC-23 does not fall within the Acts specified in Schedule-I of the NGT Act and therefore the tribunal could not entertain the petition." ;

Specifically, the complaint highlights that ENI has committed to net zero emissions by 2050, but its actions run contrary to this goal. For example, ENI plans to increase its oil production by 4% each year until at least 2024, and is proposing to rely on large amounts of negative emissions technology (7 million tonnes of CO2 stocked each year by 2030). The complaint alleges that ENI has not complied with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises due to: (i) the fact that the company's strategic plan does not foresee a sufficient cut in GHG emissions in the coming years; (ii) the lack of a climate impact assessment of the company's activities; (iii) the absence of transparent and adequate information; and (iv) the failure to develop a plan for risk prevention and mitigation. As the National Contact Point is a non-judicial grievance mechanism, the applicants have requested mediation with ENI. The complaint follows a notice to desist sent to the company by the Legality for Climate Network on July 26, 2021." ;

You’ve got air bags and anti-lock brakes. Everything in your car is designed to protect you, but none of that will protect you from this … the air you’re breathing.

                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "Upheld The ASA considered listeners would understand the claim “According to research, one of the most polluted places in London is inside your car”, in the context of an ad about the expansion of the ULEZ, to mean the level of air pollution in a car in London ranked among the places with the highest levels of air pollution in the city. We therefore expected to see evidence that compared the level of air pollution in cars in London to the level of air pollution in a variety of other contexts in which a person in London might find themselves. We assessed the evidence provided by the GLA. The pilot study focused on the levels of air pollution, specifically PM2.5 and PM10, NO2, and carbon dioxide (CO2), to which professional drivers of taxis, waste removal trucks, hospital shuttlebuses and ambulances were exposed when working in London. The level of air pollution inside the cabin of their vehicles was compared with the level of air pollution at two roadside monitoring stations at Marylebone Street and Honor Oak Park. The study found that occupational drivers faced levels of PM and NO2 concentration similar to those found at the Marylebone Road site, and at a higher NO2-to-PM ratio than at the site in Honor Oak Park. While the study did suggest that those car users were exposed to air pollution it did not comment on why these monitoring sites had been chosen and whether the level of pollution at them was representative of levels across London, or whether the average non-professional driver would spend similar average amounts of time in traffic to those who participated in the study. We considered the experience of the drivers in the study was likely to be different to that of the average non-professional driver – for example, the amount of time spent in heavy traffic, and how often their car doors were opened. While the study did offer a comparison between car users and two locations in London, we did not consider that the extent of this comparison aligned with how the claim in the ad would be interpreted. GLA referred to a study by the Institution of Occupational Health and Safety, which examined the level of exposure to diesel pollution that professional drivers based in London faced. The study monitored the levels of exposure to black carbon that 141 professional drivers of buses, vans (electric and diesel), ambulances, fire engines, lorries, taxis and waste trucks faced while at work and in their daily life over a four-day period via an air quality monitoring device with GPS capacity. The study placed the locations the drivers were monitored at into four categories: ‘At work driving’ (during work hours and moving); ‘At work not driving’ (during work hours and stopped); ‘Commuting’ (outside of work hours and moving); and ‘At home’ (outside of work hours and stopped). The study showed that the more time participants faced driving at work in comparison to ‘At work not driving’, ‘Commuting’ and ‘At home’, the greater the level of their exposure to pollution. It found that ‘At work driving’ exposure was 3.8 times higher than ‘at home’ exposure. Additionally, it outlined that when a participant was in their vehicle, they were more likely to be more exposed to pollution than when they were not. For example, when 18.6% of their time was spent ‘At work driving’, this resulted in 36.1% of total pollution exposure, and when 54.4% of time was spent ‘At home’ this only contributed 31.8% of total exposure. Additionally, the study noted that average ‘Commuting’ exposures were relatively high, but with only 4% of time spent in this activity, it only contributed 7.9% to the total exposure. We acknowledged that the report highlighted that a notable amount of the British population was employed in jobs involving driving and recommended that to limit pollution exposure people should avoid congested areas, including central London. However, we did not consider that the experience of professional drivers when in their vehicle, due to factors such as the length of time, the locations visited, the frequency of stopping and starting, or the type of vehicle used, were necessarily representative of the experiences, and therefore exposure to pollution while in a car, that the average listener would have. While the experience of the drivers in the study, who were based in London, when not at work, was relevant, the study did not detail what ‘commuting’ constituted beyond that it referred to exposure that occurred outside of work hours while the participant was moving. It did not necessarily exclusively refer to exposure that had occurred in a car being used in a similar capacity to an average driver. The study did demonstrate that most of the pollution that professional drivers in London were exposed to occurred when they were driving. It had not, however, demonstrated that this aligned with how non-professional drivers used a car or whether the exposure during a participant’s non-work hours arose from being in a car. GLA provided four reviews of studies in this area. Two reviews examined the level of air pollution commuters were exposed to when using different modes of transport in various European cities, including London. The London-focused studies were conducted between 1998 and 2008. Some preceded the implementation of the congestion charge in 2003, and all preceded the implementation of the original ULEZ in 2019. We considered that these policies could have changed London’s air quality, and any comparison to substantiate the ad’s claim would therefore need to take into account London’s ambient air quality in 2023. Furthermore, we acknowledged that the reports had made a comparison between pollution exposure when in a car and other forms of travel, such as walking or cycling. However, we considered the ad suggested that the inside of a car was one of the most polluted places in London, and that the evidence would need to demonstrate this, including in relation to other forms of travel and a variety of other locations across London. The third review article pertained to air pollution in Germany and the different ways in which people were exposed to pollutants when in a car. We therefore considered it was not relevant substantiation for the claim, which was specific to London and where a ULEZ zone had already been implemented. The fourth review was produced by the Environmental Research Group. It was funded by the GLA, but its analysis was independently prepared. It observed that a study had found that commuting accounted for 6% of a person’s time, but was responsible for approximately 30% of a person’s exposure to air pollution. The review itself focused on Traffic Related Air Pollution (TRAP), a combination of particulate and gaseous pollutants from vehicle exhausts as well as particles produced from the wear of road surfaces, tyres and brakes. It outlined that levels of TRAP were highly localised to the roadside and that they fell rapidly as the distance from the roadside was increased. It then reasoned that road users themselves occupy the highest pollutant microenvironment and were therefore disproportionately exposed to TRAP. We acknowledged the review had established that being in a car led to a high level of pollution exposure, that cars were amongst the modes of transport that led to the most pollution exposure, and that some of the studies included within the review had focused on London. We acknowledged a study within the review had shown that commuting led to a disproportionately high level of pollution exposure in comparison to the proportion of time spent doing it. However, the review’s comparison had only focused on pollution exposure when using different modes of transport. It had not commented on pollution exposure in other parts of daily life, and we did not consider that it had necessarily outlined that the inside of a car was one of the most polluted places in London. We assessed the Chief Medical Officer’s annual report 2022. We acknowledged that it established that proximity to the source of emission, such as living near major roads and in higher-density urban settings, was a controlling factor in exposure to short-lived pollutants such as NO2. However, while it did demonstrate that pollution exposure was impacted by proximity, we considered that this did not necessarily equate to demonstrating that the pollution levels inside a car were amongst the highest places of pollution exposure in London. Additionally, we reviewed the study that examined the levels of pollution that children were exposed to when travelling to school. It was funded by the GLA. The levels of pollution that 258 children across five different primary schools in London faced when travelling to and from school were examined. The study found that children who travelled, by a variety of different methods, via busier main roads were exposed to more pollution than those who travelled on quieter side roads. The majority of students did not use a car or bus when travelling to their school. The study noted that it was unable to draw any robust conclusions between these modes of travel and more active modes like walking, cycling or riding a scooter, but that its findings did suggest that children who walked along roads that had heavy traffic could potentially be exposed to higher levels of pollution than children who were driven or took the bus to school. Resultingly, while the report did suggest that proximity to the source of pollution influenced the level of exposure, it had not demonstrated that the inside of a car was one of the most polluted places in London. We reviewed the LAEI. We understood that it had been produced by the GLA and Transport for London (TfL), and they had received input from Imperial College London, two environment focused consultancy firms, Heathrow airport and the Port of London Authority. It was a dataset focused on London that modelled and made estimates over a range of areas, including but not limited to, emission trends, maps that outlined the concentration of NO2 and PM2.5, and PM10 in 2019 and in the future, and population exposure data for NO2 and PM2.5. It detailed that in 2019 air pollution in London exceeded the WHO’s recommended limits, that road transport was the single largest source of NOx and PM2.5, and that NO2 concentrations were high alongside major roads. We acknowledged that these findings outlined that London’s air was polluted, including alongside major roads, and that road vehicles were a significant contributor to that. However, the LAEI did not indicate the level of pollution found inside a car, or directly compare the level of pollution a person inside a car faced against the level of pollution exposure in other contexts in London. We assessed the three reports of experiments on the levels of air pollution that car users faced. None of the studies were based in London. The first was based in Leicester, the second was based in Asan and Chunan, South Korea, and the third was based in Los Angeles. We acknowledged that cars within London would not be substantively different to those in Leicester, South Korea and Los Angeles, but we had not seen evidence that clarified the ambient air quality in these cities was the same as London’s and that inside of a car would be one of the most polluted places in London. The Guardian video and newspaper article referred to high levels of pollution exposure when in a car. We acknowledged the experiment conducted in the video demonstrated that car usage led to a higher level of pollution exposure than when using other forms of transport. However, as the video’s experiment, the reports and the newspaper article only compared the level of pollution commuters faced when using different modes of transport or did not focus on London, we did not consider them adequate substantiation for the claim. The evidence provided had established that proximity to the source of pollution increased exposure, car users were exposed to air pollution when inside their vehicle and that it could be higher than when using other forms of transport, and that London’s air was polluted. However, a direct comparison between the level of air pollution within a car in London to a variety of other locations and contexts around London had not been made. For those reasons we concluded that the claim “According to research, one of the most polluted places in London is inside your car” had not been adequately substantiated and was likely to materially mislead.

They provided ten reports – a pilot study, four reviews of studies in this area, four studies on the level of air pollution to which drivers were exposed and a study that examined levels of pollution to which children were exposed when travelling to school. They also provided a video produced by The Guardian newspaper and King’s College London, a 2017 newspaper article, and referred to the Chief Medical Officer’s annual report 2022. The GLA said they regularly reported on air pollution by using the city’s air quality monitoring network to analyse the long-term trends in the level of pollution in the air. The most recent model they had produced was the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI) 2019. The LAEI modelled ground level concentrations of pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) in µg/m3 at 20m grid resolution. They said that the dataset from 2019 demonstrated that the limits for NO2 and PM2.5, as established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2021, were not achieved anywhere in London. They referred to three points within the 2019 LAEI. Firstly, that all areas of London exceeded safe limits of air pollution as defined by the WHO. Secondly, that road transport was the single largest source of both nitrogen oxides (NOx – the collective term for nitrous oxide and nitrogen dioxide) and PM2.5 emissions in London. Thirdly, concentrations of NO2 were higher alongside roads in comparison to surrounding areas. They said that their evidence showed that exposure to air pollution was highest when people were closer to the source of emissions. It also demonstrated that road transport was the single largest source of NOx and PM2.5 emissions, which were two of the main air pollutants in London, and that levels of NO2 concentrations and exposure were highest alongside roads. And finally, that travelling within a car or van could expose a person to more air pollution than any other form of road transport. Radiocentre said they agreed with the GLA’s response." ;

We therefore expected to see evidence relating to the CO2e produced for all Oatly products and types of cows’ milk. We had only seen evidence for the CO2e generated in the production of Oatly Barista Edition oat drink and whole cow’s milk. While we acknowledged that they would amend the claim to say which products had been included in the analysis, we concluded that because the evidence was not sufficient to support the claim as consumers would understand it, ads (a) and (b) were misleading. On that point ads (a) and (b) breached BCAP Code rules3.13.1The standards objectives, insofar as they relate to advertising, include:a) that persons under the age of 18 are protected;b) that material likely to encourage or incite the commission of crime or lead to disorder is not included in television and radio services;c) that the proper degree of responsibility is exercised with respect to the content of programmes which are religious programmes;d) that generally accepted standards are applied to the contents of television and radio services so as to provide adequate protection for members of the public from inclusion in such services of offensive and harmful material;e) that the inclusion of advertising which may be misleading, harmful or offensive in television and radio services is prevented;f) that the international obligations of the United Kingdom with respect to advertising included in television and radio services are complied with [in particular in respect of television those obligations set out in Articles 3b, 3e,10, 14, 15, 19, 20 and 22 of Directive 89/552/EEC (the Audi Visual Media Services Directive)];g) that there is no use of techniques which exploit the possibility of conveying a message to viewers or listeners, or of otherwise influencing their minds, without their being aware, or fully aware, of what has occurred\"Section 319(2).(Misleading advertising),3.93.9Broadcasters must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that the audience is likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation) and9.29.2The basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.(Environmental claims). 2. Upheld Ads (c) and (d) stated “The dairy and meat industries emit more CO2e than all the world’s planes, trains, cars, boats etc., combined. Need help talking to dad about milk? Go to oatly.com/helpdad” alongside the same video seen in ad (a). We considered consumers would understand the claim to mean that worldwide, the transport industry had a lower environmental impact than the meat and dairy industry. We also considered that, in the absence of qualification, consumers would understand that the comparison was based on an equivalent and full life cycle comparison of the emissions from those industries. We acknowledged the reports Oatly had referenced stated that greenhouse gas emissions were higher for the meat and dairy industry than the transport industry, by 0.1 gigatonnes CO2e. However, we noted the assessments of the environmental impact of the meat and dairy and transport industries had taken into account different parts of their life cycles. The evidence for the environmental impact of the meat and dairy industry took into account the full life cycle, whereas the evidence for the transport industry took into account part of the life cycle; accounting only for the emissions coming directly from using the vehicle. Because equivalent parts of the life cycle had not been accounted for in the emissions figures used to support the claim, the claim overstated the emissions from the meat and dairy industry compared to the transport industry. The difference in emissions between the meat and dairy industry and the transport industry was very small compared to the calculated emissions of 7.1 gigatonnes CO2e and 7.0 gigatonnes CO2e, respectively. We considered it was extremely unlikely that the claim would have been supported if they had used equivalent and full life cycle analysis as implied by the ad. Because the claim would be understood by consumers as based on equivalent and full life cycle analyses when that was not the case, we considered the claim was misleading.We acknowledged that Oatly had told us the claim wouldn’t be repeated. Also, they had amended a similar claim on their website to make clear the nature of the comparison, which we considered was unlikely to mislead consumers because it contained a comprehensive explanation of the comparison. Some of the complainants had raised concerns because they were aware of the 2019 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures report, published by the UK’s Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, that stated the transport sector had greater emissions than the agricultural sector. The report stated that, in 2019, the net emissions in the UK was estimated at 454.8 million tonnes CO2e, and 27% of this was generated by the transport sector and 10% by the agricultural sector. However, as set out above, we considered that the claim in the ad made clear that it referred to worldwide emissions and that the evidence Oatly presented to substantiate the claim was based on worldwide data. We did not therefore consider the claim misleading for that reason. We concluded that, because the claim would be understood by consumers as based on equivalent and full life cycle analyses when that was not the case, ads (c) and (d) were misleading. On that point ads (c) and (d) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1The standards objectives, insofar as they relate to advertising, include:a) that persons under the age of 18 are protected;b) that material likely to encourage or incite the commission of crime or lead to disorder is not included in television and radio services;c) that the proper degree of responsibility is exercised with respect to the content of programmes which are religious programmes;d) that generally accepted standards are applied to the contents of television and radio services so as to provide adequate protection for members of the public from inclusion in such services of offensive and harmful material;e) that the inclusion of advertising which may be misleading, harmful or offensive in television and radio services is prevented;f) that the international obligations of the United Kingdom with respect to advertising included in television and radio services are complied with [in particular in respect of television those obligations set out in Articles 3b, 3e,10, 14, 15, 19, 20 and 22 of Directive 89/552/EEC (the Audi Visual Media Services Directive)];g) that there is no use of techniques which exploit the possibility of conveying a message to viewers or listeners, or of otherwise influencing their minds, without their being aware, or fully aware, of what has occurred\"Section 319(2).(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

If a general claim cannot be justified, a more limited claim about specific aspects of a product might be justifiable. Marketers must ensure claims that are based on only part of the advertised product's life cycle do not mislead consumers about the product's total environmental impact.(Environmental claims). 3. Upheld Ad (e) stated “Today, more than 25% of the world’s greenhouse gases are generated by the food industry …”, in the context of an ad that discussed plant based diets and the role people could play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We understood that there were both natural and human generated greenhouse gases. However, taking the claim in the context of the whole ad, we considered that consumers would understand that Oatly were describing greenhouse gases caused by human activities only. We considered the evidence relating to the environmental impact of the food industry. The figure was taken from a comprehensive review that consolidated environmental data from 38,700 farms and 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, across the world. They calculated the food supply chain created approximately 13.7 billion metric tons of CO2e, which was 26% of the human generated greenhouse gas emissions. We therefore considered that the evidence substantiated that part of the claim. The claim in ad (e) continued, “meat and dairy account for more than half of that”. We considered that some consumers might have understood “meat and dairy” to be an all-encompassing term that also included eggs, fish, shellfish and other organisms in water environments, but that many would not. We noted that the evidence discussed the greenhouse gas emissions for meat, aquaculture (including fish and shellfish), eggs and dairy, concluding that those together accounted for 56-58% of the food industry’s emissions. We understood that the egg and aquaculture industries would have been a significant contributor to the figure for greenhouse gas emissions reported in the evidence. Because the claim would be understood by many consumers as relating only to meat and dairy, as defined narrowly, when that was not the case, we concluded that ad (e) was misleading. On that point ad (e) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1The standards objectives, insofar as they relate to advertising, include:a) that persons under the age of 18 are protected;b) that material likely to encourage or incite the commission of crime or lead to disorder is not included in television and radio services;c) that the proper degree of responsibility is exercised with respect to the content of programmes which are religious programmes;d) that generally accepted standards are applied to the contents of television and radio services so as to provide adequate protection for members of the public from inclusion in such services of offensive and harmful material;e) that the inclusion of advertising which may be misleading, harmful or offensive in television and radio services is prevented;f) that the international obligations of the United Kingdom with respect to advertising included in television and radio services are complied with [in particular in respect of television those obligations set out in Articles 3b, 3e,10, 14, 15, 19, 20 and 22 of Directive 89/552/EEC (the Audi Visual Media Services Directive)];g) that there is no use of techniques which exploit the possibility of conveying a message to viewers or listeners, or of otherwise influencing their minds, without their being aware, or fully aware, of what has occurred\"Section 319(2).(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation) and11.111.1The basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.(Environmental claims). 4. Upheld Ad (f) stated “Climate experts say cutting dairy and meat products from our diets is the single biggest lifestyle change we can make to reduce our environmental impact”. We considered consumers would understand this to be a definitive, objective claim that was based on scientific consensus. The article referenced by Oatly presented the opinion of one climate expert, who had said, “A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth”. We acknowledged that Joseph Poore was a climate expert, who had published the meta-analysis which we considered to be good quality, and his opinion was evidence based. However, the evidence only provided the opinion of one climate expert and the word “probably” had been omitted from the claim, and therefore the ad overstated what the evidence supported. We concluded that, because the claim had not be substantiated, on that basis ad (f) was misleading. On that point ad (f) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1The standards objectives, insofar as they relate to advertising, include:a) that persons under the age of 18 are protected;b) that material likely to encourage or incite the commission of crime or lead to disorder is not included in television and radio services;c) that the proper degree of responsibility is exercised with respect to the content of programmes which are religious programmes;d) that generally accepted standards are applied to the contents of television and radio services so as to provide adequate protection for members of the public from inclusion in such services of offensive and harmful material;e) that the inclusion of advertising which may be misleading, harmful or offensive in television and radio services is prevented;f) that the international obligations of the United Kingdom with respect to advertising included in television and radio services are complied with [in particular in respect of television those obligations set out in Articles 3b, 3e,10, 14, 15, 19, 20 and 22 of Directive 89/552/EEC (the Audi Visual Media Services Directive)];g) that there is no use of techniques which exploit the possibility of conveying a message to viewers or listeners, or of otherwise influencing their minds, without their being aware, or fully aware, of what has occurred\"Section 319(2).(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation) and11.111.1The basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.(Environmental claims). 5. Not upheld Ad (f) stated “If everyone in the world adopted a vegan diet, it would reduce food’s annual greenhouse emissions by 6.6bn metric tons (a 49% reduction)”. We considered consumers would understand the term “vegan diet” to mean a diet that excluded animal products. We considered the evidence relating to the environmental impact of moving from current diets to a vegan diet. The figure was taken from the same comprehensive review that Oatly used to support the claim in issue 3. The authors calculated that moving from current diets to one that excluded animal products would reduce the annual food’s greenhouse gas emissions by 6.6 billion metric tons of CO2e, which is a 49% reduction. We therefore concluded, because the claim had been substantiated, that on that basis ad (f) was not misleading. On that point, we investigated ad (f) under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1The standards objectives, insofar as they relate to advertising, include:a) that persons under the age of 18 are protected;b) that material likely to encourage or incite the commission of crime or lead to disorder is not included in television and radio services;c) that the proper degree of responsibility is exercised with respect to the content of programmes which are religious programmes;d) that generally accepted standards are applied to the contents of television and radio services so as to provide adequate protection for members of the public from inclusion in such services of offensive and harmful material;e) that the inclusion of advertising which may be misleading, harmful or offensive in television and radio services is prevented;f) that the international obligations of the United Kingdom with respect to advertising included in television and radio services are complied with [in particular in respect of television those obligations set out in Articles 3b, 3e,10, 14, 15, 19, 20 and 22 of Directive 89/552/EEC (the Audi Visual Media Services Directive)];g) that there is no use of techniques which exploit the possibility of conveying a message to viewers or listeners, or of otherwise influencing their minds, without their being aware, or fully aware, of what has occurred\"Section 319(2).(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

Oatly UK Ltd said they commissioned CarbonCloud, independent product life cycle assessment experts, to calculate the emissions of Oatly Barista Edition oat drink and British whole cow’s milk. They said these products were chosen for the calculations because they wanted to showcase their Barista Edition product, and whole cow’s milk was the most comparable dairy product to this because of the fat content, taste profile and suitability for speciality coffee drinks. CarbonCloud used an attributional approach to life cycle accounting in the emissions calculation for Oatly Barista and whole cow’s milk, which accounted for emissions and removals of greenhouse gases generated during a product’s life cycle. It did not take into account avoided emissions, actions taken to mitigate released emissions or carbon offsetting. The climate footprint was assessed from cradle to store. CarbonCloud calculated the climate footprint of Oatly Barista to be 0.44 kg CO2e/kg and included the emissions from agricultural production of oats and rapeseed, processing of ingredients, transport of ingredients, energy consumption in the Oatly factory, packaging and distribution. They calculated the climate footprint of whole cow’s milk to be 1.6 kg CO2e/kg and included the emissions from agriculture, transport of ingredients, energy consumption of the dairy factory, packaging and distribution. In both reports, the following factors were omitted from the emissions calculation: product losses after filling; manufacture of capital goods (e.g. machinery; trucks, infrastructure); overheat operations (e.g. facility lighting, air conditioning); corporate activities and services; transport of the product user to the retail location; and transport of employees to and from work. Oatly said the ad included a link where viewers could obtain the reports and see which products were the subject of the comparison. Oatly said that because the calculation did not account for whole life cycles of the products, they had included the qualification “from grower to grocer”. They also said they would amend the claim to clarify that it related specifically to a comparison between Oatly Barista Edition and whole milk. Clearcast said the CarbonCloud reports for Oatly Barista and whole cow’s milk covered the same parts of the life cycles. They said the claim made clear the comparison and therefore did not require absolute cradle to grave data. The claim was clear to viewers as to what part of the life cycle was being compared and there was no implication through visuals or additional claims that this part of the life cycle would suggest a greater environmental impact. 2. Oatly said they drew a comparison between the CO2e emissions from the global meat and dairy industry and the transport industry because the impact of transport on climate change was more widely understood than the impact from food choices. They referred to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) report: Tackling Climate Change Through Livestock – A global assessment of emissions and mitigation opportunities; and the UK Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report Climate Change 2014 Mitigation of Climate Change in support of the claim. They said they did not have plans to repeat the claim and had removed organic product posts from their social media channels that made similar claims. They also said they had amended a similar claim on their website to: “Emissions from the global livestock supply chain are estimated at 7.1 Gigatonnes of CO2e per year. That's taking a lifecycle approach and looking at the whole supply chain including emissions from animal digestion and manure but also emissions involved in producing feed, using fertilisers and land usage, as well as processing and transporting meat and dairy. To put that figure in context, the emissions from all the world’s cars, planes, trains, boats, go-carts, etc. combined is estimated at 7.0 Gigatonnes of CO2e (that's driving, flying or sailing them, not making them, extracting fuel or scrapping old cars). So yeah, food choice matters**”. They said any future social media ads making similar claims would reflect that wording. 3. They provided an extract from a meta-analysis by Joseph Poore, a climate expert, published in Science, that they said substantiated the claim that “Today, more than 25% of the world's greenhouse gases are generated by the food industry” and that “meat and dairy account for more than half of that”. The meta-analysis consolidated worldwide data on the environmental impact of various food production systems. They referred to the same IPCC report used to support the claim challenged in Point 2, that they said also substantiated the claim. They highlighted that both sources were listed in small text at the bottom of the ad. In their opinion, particularly in the context of the ad, which made a number of references to “plant based” eating, consumers would likely understand the phrase “meat and dairy” in contrast to that to mean all animal products. Meat was defined as the flesh of an animal and therefore would include fish. Eggs were also regularly included within dairy. 4. They said the claim “Climate experts say cutting dairy and meat products from our diets is the single biggest lifestyle change we can make to reduce our environmental impact” was based on a quote from Joseph Poore, in a newspaper article published in 2018. The quote was based on the results from the meta-analysis used to support the claim challenged in Point 3. In their opinion, Poore’s view also reflected the views of the authors of the studies referred to within the meta-analysis as well as the authors of the meta-analysis. They provided an extract from the newspaper article that they said supported that Poore’s view was shared by the authors of the study. They provided the extract from which the quote was adapted, that said following a vegan diet would reduce a person’s environmental impact more than cutting down their flights, buying an electric car, or purchasing sustainable meat and dairy. 5. They provided extracts from the same meta-analysis published in Science used to support the claim in issue 3 and a report from the Institute for Climate Economics: Food policies and climate: a literature review, that they said substantiated the claim “If everyone in the world adopted a vegan diet, it would reduce food’s annual greenhouse emissions by 6.6bn metric tons (a 49% reduction)”." ;

The first: Under section 104(1) of the Act, does the decision maker have to consider the contribution that the subsequent emissions will make towards climate change. The second: Under section 7(i) of the Act, must the decision-maker must give particular regard to the effects of climate change, including the contribution that the subsequent emissions will have towards the effects of climate change. The court affirmed the decision of the environment court and dismissed the appeal.

The MPF alleges that the defendant’s occupation of the land was illegal because it was part of an Agroextractivist Settlement Project (PAE), owned and managed by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and occupied by traditional extractivist communities. This CPA is part of a set of 22 lawsuits filed by the MPF as a result of the investigation conducted under Civil Inquiry No. 1.13.000.001719/2015-49 into illegal deforestation within the Antimary Agroextractivist Settlement Project (PAE), although each case involves different defendants. The lawsuit is based, among other elements, on Brazilian environmental law, emphasizing the constitutional protection of the environment, allegations of deforestation, propter rem civil liability for environmental damage (including climate-related damage), and collective moral damages. The action also highlights the unauthorized emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) caused by the illegal deforestation of the area, estimated at 107,470.09 tons of carbon dioxide, which are directly linked to Brazil’s failure to meet its climate goals. These emissions place the country at odds with its national and international commitments under the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC) (Federal Law 12,187/2009) and the Paris Agreement (promulgated by Federal Decree 9,073/2017)." ;

The ASA considered that the claims that Etihad allowed consumers to explore the world with “Total Peace Of Mind”, alongside the phrase “Environmental Advocacy”, would be understood by consumers to mean that Etihad actively worked to protect the environment and, consequently, consumers could use their services with “Total Peace Of Mind” with regard to the environmental impact of doing so. We therefore expected to see a high level of evidence, which showed how they offered consumers total peace of mind about the environmental impact of using their service. We understood that air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. We also understood that there were currently no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry that would adequately substantiate absolute green claims, such as that Etihad were providing consumers with “Total Peace Of Mind” when travelling by air, and engaging in “Environmental Advocacy”, as we considered consumers would interpret them in this context. While we welcomed Etihad’s decision to remove the phrase “Environmental advocacy” from future ads, we had not seen any evidence that they were engaged in such advocacy, or that they actively worked to protect the environment in a way that meant consumers could use their services with “Total Peace Of Mind” with regard to the environmental impact of doing so. We therefore concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of Etihad’s environmental impact, and that the ad breached the Code.

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but challenging different carbon credit projects. The Pacajaí project (Project 981), which is the subject of the lawsuit, overlaps with the areas of the Joana Peres II - Dorothy Stang and Joana Peres II - Rio Pacajá State Agro-Extractive Settlement Projects (PEAEX). These PEAEXs are public lands whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 981 generates REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and increased forest carbon stocks), has been certified by an international company and was established in 2008 to obtain carbon credits for forty years. Companies and individuals are sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of rural property. The DPE-PA claims that the land covered by Project 981 is illegal because it is located on public land within the perimeter of the settlements and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. It is emphasised that the project was implemented without a prior technical study. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and public forest concessions and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. It argues that the defendants' behaviour gives rise to the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) suspension of Project 981 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 981 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel." ;

The CAP Code also stated that promoters must conduct their promotions fairly and avoid causing unnecessary disappointment. Promoters were responsible for all aspects and all stages of their promotions. The ASA understood that the technical issue which affected Alexa users from linking their accounts to the News Broadcasting Skill began on 2 May 2024, six days prior to the launch of the promotion on 8 May 2024. We also understood that there had been technical issues that impacted linking Alexa accounts with Skills generally in March and April 2024. We acknowledged that Virgin Radio said they had tested the entry route prior to the promotion’s launch, although we considered it was not clear how that testing had been carried out or when. However, we considered that as the promotion relied on a single-entry route, which was relatively novel requiring participants to link their Alexa accounts with the Skills app, and which had also recently experienced technical problems, Virgin Radio should have carried out real-world testing prior to and in the run up to the promotion’s launch, including the day of the launch. We had, however, seen no evidence of that. We considered that as the technical issue appeared to have been causing the error for six days prior to the launch of the promotion, adequate pre-launch testing would have likely identified the issue. The launch of the promotion could then have been suspended until it had been fixed. We therefore did not consider the technical issue was an unavoidable circumstance beyond Virgin Radio’s control. We considered that the multiple extensions of the closing date increased the overall pool of entrants to the prize draw and therefore reduced the odds of winning for those who had pre-linked their Alexa accounts with the News Broadcasting Skill and who sought to participate within the original terms. Whilst we acknowledged that those participants could have amassed more entries than the participants entering the promotion after the technical issue was fixed, we considered that nevertheless by extending the promotion and increasing the overall pool of entrants, their odds of winning were reduced and that they were therefore disadvantaged by the extensions of the closing date. We also considered that by the time the promotion’s entry route was working for new users on 19 July 2024, those participants were entering a draw in which a proportion of participants had already had the opportunity to gain multiple entries. That group of participants, i.e. those who sought to participate within the original terms, but couldn’t until the technical problem was resolved, also had a diminished chance of winning, and we considered they were also disadvantaged. We considered that the published promotion rules did not release the advertiser from complying with the requirements of the Code in relation to the extension of closing dates. Because we considered the promotion’s closing date was changed due to factors that were not unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the promoter, and because the change of closing date disadvantaged those who sought to participate within the original terms and therefore caused unnecessary disappointment, we concluded that the promotion had not been administered fairly and breached the Code. The promotion breached CAP Code rules (Edition 12) rules 8.1, 8.2 (Promotional marketing), 8.14 (Administration) and 8.17.4.E (Significant conditions for promotions)." ;

Virgin Radio stated that from February 2024, listeners were able to link their Alexa devices to their New Broadcasting Skill. They said that prior to the launch of the promotion, they tested the game and had previously tested mandatory account linking for the News Broadcasting Skill via talkSPORT. They said that they tested the game across February and March 2024, and entered the secondary testing phase on 25 March 2024, which aimed to test the promotion in a real-world environment. Virgin Radio said they worked with Amazon in the lead-up to the launch of the Skill in an attempt to troubleshoot technical issues. Virgin Radio said they launched the “Beat the intro” competition on 8 May 2024, which had an original closing date of 8 June 2024. However, due to technical issues with the Alexa device that began on 2 May 2024, listeners were unable to link their accounts. Virgin Radio said they raised this issue with Amazon. The technical issue meant that only listeners who had linked their device prior to the start of the promotion were able to enter. In response, they suspended on-air and planned print media promotional activity for the promotion. They said they tested the promotion internally and conducted demonstrations on personal devices in weekly meetings and discussed the promotion in detail, before, during and after the launch. They also said that they worked on the promotion with a third party, who also conducted testing of the promotion. They said that as the issue persisted, they extended the closing date, initially to 20 July 2024, then again to the 19 August 2024. They updated the terms and conditions of the promotion each time they amended the closing date. They explained that throughout that period, the promotion continued to be playable for those who had linked their Alexa prior to May 2024, until mid-July, when Amazon resolved the technical issue. The promotion then became available to all, providing they linked their Alexa and News Broadcasting Skill. The promotion ended as expected with no further issues on 19 August 2024. The winner was chosen from all entries to the prize draw. They stated that Amazon experienced technical issues at the time of the promotion’s launch, and those issues were unpredictable and beyond their control. They believed it was necessary to extend the closing date and that their extensions sought to avoid unfairness to potential participants who were unable to participate under the original terms, as only a small percentage of Virgin Radio UK listeners had linked their Alexa accounts at the time of the promotion’s launch. They believed that the extension did not disadvantage those who were able to participate from the outset, as their entries during the entire promotional period were entered into the prize draw. They further highlighted that those participants could have accrued more entries to the prize draw than the participants who could only participate later when the technical issue was fixed, as the entry rules meant each participant was entitled to one per day. They further stated that their published rules for the promotion reserved their right to make updates or amendments in certain circumstances, which included reasons beyond their control, such as the unavailability of an entry platform before the closing date. Their rules also said that the promoter reserved the right to cancel, modify or supersede the promotion, at any time, in its sole discretion. They said that the promotion was created to encourage Virgin Radio listeners to link their accounts via the Alexa and they had issued step by step instructions for how to do that to assist listeners. They had relied on Alexa for its mechanics and no alternative method of entry was possible. They stated the prize draw was run purely for promotional purposes, intended to help make Virgin Radio UK a ‘preferred’ station for those who took part, and that no entry fee or purchase was required to enter. Amazon said that to their knowledge, the issue linking the Skills was isolated to Virgin Radio and began on 4 March 2024. There had also been another account linking issue that affected a range of Skills, which began on 23 April 2024. They also said they were not involved in the administration or planning of the promotion." ;

Smaller text below the image stated \"BOOK YOUR EXTENDED TEST DRIVE … Understandably, there are still restrictions as life slowly gets back to normal. Not so with the Defender, the 4WD vehicle with a capacity to go almost anywhere and do almost anything. If you take one for an extended test drive … a whole new world of freedom awaits\"." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1. Not upheld The ASA considered that consumers were unlikely to interpret the claim in a literal way to mean that the vehicle had been exempted from any current laws, rules or regulations that were designed to combat global climate change or wide-scale ecological damage caused by the motoring industry. Instead, we considered that the claim “LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS”, was ambiguous and could be read either simply as a claim celebrating the ability to use the vehicle to visit different locations without restriction or, when read with the text further down the ad that stated \"Understandably, there are still restrictions as life slowly gets back to normal”, as a reference to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the easing of lockdown restrictions. In that respect we noted that at the time the ad was published, in June 2021, a number of lockdown restrictions related to the pandemic had been phased out. Further phasing-out of remaining restrictions was imminent, and we considered that the ad could have been understood by consumers in that context. We considered that consumers would not infer that the ad was making claims about the vehicle benefitting from exemptions from laws or other rules designed to tackle global climate change and wide-scale ecological degradation. It was instead a general reference to the freedom to drive to different locations or specifically to drive in the context of COVID-19 restrictions easing. We concluded, therefore, that the claim “LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS” was not misleading. On that point, we investigated the ad under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.2 (Misleading advertising), but did not find it in breach. 2. Not upheld The ad depicted a Land Rover Defender on what appeared to be an untarmacked dirt track in an otherwise untouched, pristine forest. The bottom half of the vehicle was splattered with mud, especially around the wheel arches and across the lower portion of the front and rear doors. At the top of the ad was the prominent statement “LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS”. As referenced in point 1, we considered that statement was ambiguous and could be read either as referring to the specific easing of lockdown restrictions or the general benefits of driving a vehicle to freely visit different locations. We acknowledged that four-wheel drive SUVs, such as the Land Rover Defender, were popular with all types of vehicle owners, including those who lived in urban as well as rural environments. We understood they were designed to be capable of tackling rugged terrain environments, such as off-road driving by specialist purchasers of vehicles, such as farmers, and for other specialised commercial land-use purposes. We also acknowledged that national forests, parks and other rural locations were ecologically-sensitive areas. In particular, we understood that publicly owned forests in the UK were subject to the Forestry Commission Byelaws, which prohibited the driving and parking of motor vehicles on Forestry Commission land. In the UK’s National Parks we understood it was illegal to drive on some forms of trackways such as footpaths, bridleways, restricted bye-ways or entirely off-track. We considered advertisers should take care when depicting vehicles in those particular scenarios. However, we also noted that untarmacked road surfaces could often be encountered in many rural areas, and that the use of vehicles like that shown in the ad could be vital in those communities for navigating country roads and tracks, and the track in the ad would be recognised as such. We also considered that mud splatters could be a common feature of vehicles driven in rural areas, and were not necessarily indicative of irresponsible use. We therefore considered that the vehicle depicted in the ad was not being used irresponsibly. For those reasons, we considered the ad did not encourage or condone the use of the vehicle in ecologically-sensitive or in off-road environments, such as forests or national parks that were subject to legal restrictions on the use of motor vehicles, in ways that could be detrimental to the environment. We concluded therefore that the ad was not socially irresponsible. On that point, we investigated the ad under CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility), but did not find it in breach." ;

Jaguar Land Rover Ltd believed the average consumer would not infer from the claim “LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS” that the vehicle shown was above rules aimed at preventing climate change or ecological damage. The ad was up-beat in tone, and the claim “LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS” referred to both the challenges faced by consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions. 2. Jaguar Land Rover said they did not use ecologically sensitive or protected areas when producing ads, and they believed that the ad did not contain any active or passive implication that consumers should do so. It was beyond their scope to anticipate every unlawful activity of any customer and address all such circumstances in an ad. Jaguar Land Rover said the ad depicted a vehicle on an established track in a forest, with no fresh or novel disturbance involved, and focused on the increased freedom that had become available following the easing of COVID-related restrictions. In their view, the vehicle, which was capable of carbon emission of 75 grams per kilometre, was not heavily polluting, and was below the certified legal threshold for noise levels. The ad therefore did not irresponsibly condone or encourage the use of vehicles in ecologically sensitive areas, or promote disturbance to protected species. The Guardian understood that the ad had appeared in a number of other national newspapers around the same time and said they did not consider the ad to be socially irresponsible on the basis that it would encourage driving in a location or in a manner which was detrimental to the environment. They said the ad depicted a four-wheel drive vehicle driving along a clearly defined track, rather than being driven through built-up forest, which they understood was a lawful use of the vehicle. The vehicle had not driven over greenery or wildlife, which might be destroyed, and had not been shown driving erratically or in a manner which might otherwise be detrimental to the forest or wildlife within it. The Guardian believed readers would not reasonably infer that the ad suggested the vehicle itself was genuinely above restrictions or rules. They considered that the sentence “LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS” was tongue in cheek, rather than suggesting that the vehicle was not subject to laws or rules. Additionally, given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, they believed readers were likely to have understood the ad’s use of the word “restrictions” as referring to the recent easing of lockdown restrictions." ;

The complaint alleged that Shell falsely claimed that the damage caused by CO2 emissions can be offset or neutralized through voluntary carbon credits. The complaint was based on various scientific reports, including the IPCC Synthesis Report in 2014. The Committee held that the average consumers would understand the term \"neutralized\" to mean that the harm caused by CO2 emissions was completely compensated by offsetting measures. This impression was reinforced by the manner that Shell issued an explanation of the campaign on its website. While the RCC acknowledged that Shell had plausibly demonstrated that it followed certain standards and guidelines, it pointed out that Shell did not guarantee the full offsetting in practice. The RCC stressed that article 3 of the Code for Environmental Advertising (MRC) set a high bar with regards to environmental claims which must be demonstrably correct. Against this background, Shell's claim were too absolute, as they guaranteed a result which was not certain. Thus, the Committee found the advertising claims to be misleading and in breach of articles 2 and 3 MRC." ;

Upheld The CAP Code required that absolute environmental claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. Ads (a) and (b) stated that because Etihad understood the impact flying had on the environment, they were “taking a louder, bolder approach to sustainable aviation”. While the accompanying video in ad (a) mentioned, “Etihad Guest Miles”, “ETIHAD GUEST CONSCIOUS CHOICES” and said that they had won an environmental award, it gave no further context or explanation as to how “sustainable aviation” was being achieved. The video in ad (b) said Etihad were cutting back on single-use plastics, flying with the most modern and efficient planes which had a “smaller footprint” and had won an environmental award. However, we considered such qualifying information was material to consumers' understanding of the claim, and without it being made clear in the initial text, consumers would understand the \"sustainable aviation\" claim to be about Etihad's whole business. The ASA acknowledged Etihad’s comments that the claim “sustainable aviation” would be understood, especially in the aviation industry, as a long-term, multifaceted goal, which included their aspiration to reach “net zero” carbon emissions by 2050. However, we noted that the ads were aimed at the general public and not specifically at those in the airline industry and that neither ad mentioned Etihad’s desire to be “net-zero” by 2050 or positioned the claim “sustainable aviation” as a long-term aspiration. We acknowledged Etihad’s comments about the use of modern aircraft and flight practices to reduce emissions. We understood, however, that air travel continued to produce high levels of CO2 and non-CO2 emissions which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. We noted the further initiatives and targets Etihad said they were committed to delivering in pursuit of their stated goal but many of these initiatives were targeted to only deliver results years or decades into the future. Further to that, initiatives such as reducing single use plastics and using more efficient aircraft were not adequate substantiation to evidence a \"sustainable aviation\" claim. While we noted steps were being taken by Etihad to reduce the environmental impact of its service, we understood that there were currently no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry which would adequately substantiate an absolute green claim such as “sustainable aviation” as we considered consumers would interpret it in this context. We concluded, therefore, that the claim exaggerated the impact that flying with Etihad would have on the environment and the ads breached the Code.

Etihad Airways stated that the claim “sustainable aviation” in ads (a) and (b) was not intended to be understood as an absolute solution to the environmental impact from aviation and they did not accept that they would be interpreted in that way. In contrast they said the claim would be widely understood as a long-term and multi-faceted process, in which Etihad had included an aspiration to reach “net zero” carbon emissions by 2050. They said “sustainable aviation” had been a widely used and publicised term in the aviation industry for a number of years and was used by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Further to that Etihad’s sustainability strategy was in line with EASA’s sustainability priorities and incorporated initiatives by Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government. It focused on solutions to fast-track the transition to cleaner fuels, develop a carbon credits ecosystem locally and support strong standards globally, explore and develop emissions avoidance mechanisms through non-CO2 effects and engaging Etihad’s customers and stakeholders in supporting de-carbonisation. That multi-faceted approach meant Etihad had to take “bolder” decisions than before, putting in place new initiatives and technology within a coherent strategy focused on sustainability. They provided examples of that “bolder” approach which included a restructure of their fleet to use modern, fuel efficient aircraft. The development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel production in the UAE, in a project that looked at energy and food security. The testing of contrail management mechanisms and optimisation of aircraft descent and ascent operations to save fuel. The use of the latest digital navigation charts and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) burn management methods to find the most efficient way to fly. They had further received support from the Botanical Garden’s Conservation Initiative’s Global Diversity standard, the only international certification that recognised and promoted the protection and restoration of biodiversity. They had engaged Etihad guests and stakeholders in their Conscious Choices programme, which for guests aimed to encourage and reward environmentally friendly habits and for stakeholders aimed to help Etihad to integrate Sustainable Aviation Fuel in their operations. Finally they had also approached local and global regulators to promote ICAO’s goal to reach net zero by 2050 and supported the UAE government in the sector’s net-zero resolution. Etihad said they had also achieved a number of awards which evidenced their “louder, bolder approach to sustainable aviation”. Those included a stage two certification from International Air Transport Association (IATA) Environment Assessment Programme, a bronze EcoVadis rating, the “Best Airline For Sustainability” from American Business Traveller, a 2022 sustainability award by Nat Geo Traveller China, an “Environmental Sustainability Innovation of the Year” award from CAPA and environmental airline of the year 2022 in the Airline Ratings awards." ;

We recognised that some care would need to be taken when going for a run alone in the middle of the night, particularly for women, and we considered that people would be likely to realise that by doing so, they could be placed in a vulnerable position. We noted that the woman shown in the ads appeared alert and aware of her surroundings, and was seen running in well-lit, main streets where other people were present. We considered, therefore, that the woman was not shown behaving recklessly or obviously placing herself in danger. We considered that running alone at night, of itself, was not likely to result in harm or injury. Whilst we acknowledged that an attack could happen, that was outside of a person’s control and it could also happen in other, everyday scenarios and at all times of the day or night. For those reasons, we concluded that the ads did not encourage an unsafe practice and were not irresponsible. We investigated ad (a) under BCAP Code rules1.21.2Advertisements must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to the audience and to society.(Social responsibility) and4.44.4Advertisements must not include material that is likely to condone or encourage behaviour that prejudices health or safety.(Harm and offence), but did not find it in breach.

They said they would not be showing the ads again in the UK. However, they were unsure whether the ads breached the advertising codes and welcomed a ruling to provide clarity. They said the ads were not intended to encourage women to go running at night. They were intended to celebrate individuality and demonstrate the use of Samsung products when exercising, whatever the time of day. They pointed out that the unsafe element complained about related to the risk of predatory individuals attacking the woman shown in the ads and that running alone at night, of itself, did not present that risk. They said the victims of attacks (who had chosen to run alone at night) should never be blamed or judged for deciding to take the risk and they believed that a ruling that advertisers could not show individuals running alone might be perceived in that way. They acknowledged that the risk of attacks by predatory individuals may be higher at night or in city environments. However, the risk did not only present itself in that scenario; it also presented in numerous other scenarios shown in advertising, such as individuals taking a taxi alone, walking alone at any time of day, getting drinks in a bar, going on a first date, etc. They also believed there was a risk of there being harmful gender stereotyping if advertising rules did not allow advertisers to show women engaging in activities which presented a risk of a predatory individual attacking them, but allowed for men to be shown undertaking the same activity (for example, if the rules only allowed for men to be shown running alone at night). Samsung said if there was a concern that the use of earbuds shown in the ads reduced safety, the ASA should be aware that the product had a feature which allowed the user to amplify ambient sound (so that ambient sound was not blocked out by the earbuds). Clearcast explained that when considering ad (a) they had discussed the issue of violence against female runners. Their decision was that to not clear the ad would be to place the fault for the violence on the female runners rather than on the perpetrators of the violence. They could understand that the ad could have been perceived as insensitive to some viewers, given recent tragic events, but they did not believe the ad breached the advertising code. They understood, in relation to previous ASA rulings, that a breach of BCAP Code rule 4.4 was generally related to something in the behaviour of a person in the ad that was judged to be irresponsible or harmful to their health and safety. In the present case, the harmful thing was behaviour not shown in the ad or alluded to in any way. There should be nothing inherently dangerous in a woman going for a run but unfortunately, as recent cases had shown, there could be. That danger was not the fault of the woman running and Clearcast were concerned that if the complaints were Upheld, it could set a precedent for wider victim blaming, making it difficult to assess future ads. They pointed out that they had, in the past, cleared ads that featured men running at night with headphones, which were not investigated. They were concerned that if the complaints were Upheld, it would make it difficult to find the balance between what behaviour shown was appropriate for women versus men. Furthermore, they said the city environment featured in the ad was well lit and there were other people at various stages of the run. The Cinema Advertising Association (CAA) explained that their panel did not believe ad (b) breached the Code and were concerned that by not showing women doing things like jogging at night, that could constitute a social harm. They believed that a breach of CAP Code rule 1.3 would imply that women were socially irresponsible to go running at night, and a breach of CAP Code rule 4.5 implied that the potential victim would be responsible for any harm that occurred to them if they did. They said that advertising tended to be aspirational, and the panel felt that most women would aspire to live in a world where jogging in the streets after dark was safe, even if, in many places, they knew perfectly well it would not be safe. They also felt the woman featured in the ad was subverting unspoken gender norms in a positive way. It was considered more socially acceptable for a man to run late at night, rather than a woman. The tagline “I run on a different schedule. Mine” indicated that the woman in the ad wanted to, and did, run at night as that worked best for her. The panel felt that women should be able to run at night or at any time of the day. Normalising an approach of not showing women in situations where they were perceived as being potential victims did not protect women or keep them from harm. The CAA believed the overall aspirational aspect of the ad was clear in the way the woman was seen meeting only friends, acquaintances and unaggressive strangers on her city run and in the way the watch offered her the opportunity to do that at any time of day. Many women worked long hours/nights or shift work and might only be able to run at night or very early in the morning, when it was still dark. However, they pointed out that when it was not dark, it did not prevent a woman from being harmed and they reflected on those recent high-profile cases where women were fatally attacked during daylight hours or in well-lit, busy places. They said if the ad was ruled to be irresponsible on the grounds that the action portrayed would encourage an unsafe practice, that could be taken as akin to the police saying that women should not venture into town centres after dark. That attitude was, understandably, castigated as victim blaming. Ideally the authorities should render the streets safe to jog in after dark. If advertising depicting a woman running at night became socially unacceptable it begged the question of what else might constitute a socially dangerous situation for a woman. Removing women from certain spaces would not stop attacks on women from happening, but could, in their view, create dangerous precedent that women should not be in certain spaces or behave in certain ways for ‘their own safety’. Such an argument was rejected by many as sexist in the extreme." ;

The plaintiff argued that the issuance of the permit was against the 2009 EPMA and Government Regulation No. 36 of 2010 on Nature Tourism Business in Wildlife Sanctuaries, National Parks, Grand Forest Parks and Nature Tourism Parks because it did not involve the community in the permit application process and had the potential to cause damage to the mangrove ecosystem.

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but questioning different carbon credit projects. The Ribeirinho REDD+ Project (Project 2620), which is the subject of the lawsuit, overlaps the areas of five State Agro-Extractivist Settlement Projects (PEAEX). These PEAEX are public lands, whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 2620 was presented to an international certifying company in 2017, but has not yet been registered, to generate REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and an increase in forest carbon stocks) for a period of thirty years. The companies and association are being sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of the rural properties where it is located. The DPE-PA alleges irregularities in the property registrations that make up the project, and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. In addition, the mayor of Portel issued a Public Utility Decree authorising its operation, which the DPE-PA argues is unconstitutional. It is emphasised that no prior technical study was carried out for the project. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and public forest concessions and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. It argues that the defendants' behaviour entails the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) suspension of Project 2620 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 2620 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel." ;

They were designed to release wastewater and rainwater into waterways when sewers become overwhelmed. Storm overflows are outdated and unfit for the 21st century. The old ways are no longer the best ways, so we're following a different course. That's why we're investing £3 million a month to tackle storm overflows. Building more storm tanks to increase storage. Separating rainwater from sewage. Treating wastewater naturally using wetlands. And monitoring changes to water quality. We can all find ways to help. Such as collecting rainwater to keep it out of the sewers. And we can bin wet wipes so they don't cause sewer blockages. It won't happen overnight. But a better way, for our waterways, is already underway. Wessex Water. For you. For life.” The ad included various scenes, including an aerial shot of a tree-lined river, and a person inspecting a water sample in a wetlands setting." ;

It specified that the basis of environmental claims must be clear, and that unqualified claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. The ad initially focused on the problems with storm overflows – that is, they discharged sewage into waterways when sewers became overwhelmed with rainwater – and the improvements that Wessex Water were investing in, which was a specific initiative. The ad then broadened out in scope, and stated “The old ways are no longer the best ways, so we’re following a different course […] building more storm tanks to increase storage. Separating rainwater from sewage. Treating wastewater naturally using wetlands. And monitoring changes to water quality. We can all find ways to help […] a better way, for our waterways is already underway. Wessex Water. For you. For life”. The ASA considered the overall impression of the ad was that Wessex Water were currently taking steps to improve their water management and systems not only to protect properties from flooding, but also to reduce environmental damage caused by pollution incidents associated with storm overflow failure. In particular, we considered the claims “a different course”, “For you. For life” and “A better way for our waterways is already underway”, and the visuals of a dark background changing to green waterways and wetlands contributed to the impression that, although the improvements were still in progress, some environmental benefit was already being achieved. All water companies had licences and permits that they were required to comply with to reduce their impact on, and protect, the water environment. The Environment Agency stated that storm overflows were a necessary part of the current sewerage system. They discharged storm sewage (wastewater diluted with rainwater) to rivers or seas during periods of heavy or prolonged rainfall to prevent storm sewage backing up into homes and streets. If they operated within those circumstances and were compliant with their permit, they were not reported and recorded as pollution incidents. Furthermore, water companies were monitored for their compliance with their permits to discharge treated water from sewage treatment works and water treatment works.In 2022, which we understood was the most recent year for which data was available, Wessex Water had an overall EPA rating of two stars (out of a possible four), which meant the “company requires improvement”. Their EPA rating in 2021 was also two stars, in contrast to the period 2011-2020 where they had achieved either three or four stars. The 2022 EPA report stated they performed below target (amber status) for the number of sewerage pollution incidents. Furthermore, their performance was significantly below target (red status) for the number of serious pollution incidents related to sewerage and water supply in 2021 and 2022. We accepted that Wessex Water’s activities in the area of storm overflows would likely result in improvements to their environmental impact. However, because their storm overflow problems had also caused harm to the environment, reflected in the most recent EPA rating, which contradicted the overall impression of the ad, we considered that was significant information which should have been made clear in the ads.

The ad openly acknowledged that wastewater was released into the environment when overflows operated and presented a substantiated course of action by which Wessex Water proposed to address that issue.In response to the complainant’s concern that the infrastructure had not been updated in accordance with regulations, Wessex Water said they had invested in accordance with the requirements of the Water Services Regulation Authority (OFWAT). Their five-yearly business plan had also been approved by OFWAT. In support of the claim that £3 million per month was being invested into tackling storm overflows, they provided an overview of capital expenditure for the period 2020 to 2025. Their Storm Overflows Improvement Plan listed their capital investment schemes for increasing storage capacity, introducing nature-based solutions such as reed beds and separating surface water from wastewater. For many years they had monitored and published real-time water quality data for all overflow operations at designated bathing water sites, and at the end of 2023 they had achieved their target of fitting monitors on all other storm overflows in the region. All scenes in the ad, including the construction sites and wetlands, had been shot in the Wessex Water region. Wessex Water acknowledged that their Environmental Performance Assessment (EPA) ratings were low for 2021 and 2022, but anticipated that they would return to a four-star rating when results were published for 2023. They said there had been extensive media coverage of investigations into sewage discharge and storm overflows, and believed viewers would therefore have some knowledge of the issues. They pointed out that “For you. For life” had been their company strapline since 2019 and was not specific to the ad. They said it referred to water being essential for human life and related to the water supply rather than the sewerage aspect of their business. Clearcast said they recognised the importance of ensuring that marketing communications did not downplay or obscure past faults, malpractices or environmental concerns. When they reviewed the ad they took into consideration the wider context of investigations and prosecutions surrounding water companies and sewage release into waterways. In their view, the ad took a balanced and transparent approach by acknowledging and addressing the shortcomings of outdated systems, particularly storm overflows and sewers, while providing an honest account of their forward progress plan. It gave only objective details of the improvements being made. It made no environmental impact statements, and did not imply environmental benefits or discount past events. In the context of an ad that set out and explained the flaws with old systems and detailed future improvements, “A better way for our waterways” did not, in their view, constitute an environmental improvement statement." ;

The lawsuit is based, among other things, on Brazilian environmental law concerning the constitutional protection of the environment, the accusation of deforestation, propter rem civil liability for environmental damage, including climate damage, and collective moral damages. It also mentions the unauthorized emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) caused by the illegal deforestation of the area, calculated at 98,367.84 tons of carbon dioxide and which are directly related to the Brazilian State's departure from its climate goals, out of step with national and international commitments made by Brazil in the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009) and in the Paris Agreement (promulgated by Federal Decree 9.073/2017).

In that capacity it applied for permission to bring a derivative claim against Shell’s directors under section 260 of the Companies Act 2006. The claim concerned Shell’s climate change risk management strategy, as well as its response to the Milieudefensie v Royal Dutch Shell plc ruling.
In respect of these, ClientEarth alleged the directors had breached their general duties to promote the success of Shell (section172) and to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence (section 174), along with certain specific or ‘incidental’ duties formulated by ClientEarth (such as a duty to make judgements regarding climate risk that are based upon a reasonable consensus of scientific opinion). The various alleged breaches of these duties were grouped by the court under the following headings: failure to set an appropriate emissions target; failure of the strategy to manage climate risk to establish a reasonable basis for achieving the net zero target and align with the 1.5oC; and failure to comply with the Milieudefensie ruling.
The court’s permission is required to continue a derivative claim of this nature. An application for permission cannot proceed if it appears to the court that it does not show a prima facie case for giving permission. On May 12, 2023, having reviewed the case papers, the High Court dismissed ClientEarth’s application on the basis no such prima facie case had been shown. ClientEarth exercised its right for that decision to be reconsidered at a hearing, following which the High Court re-affirmed its original decision, refusing permission and dismissing the claim. The court’s reasons are set out in its judgment of July 24, 2023. In summary:
There were a number of fundamental reasons why the breaches alleged did not establish a prima facie case. Firstly, very little weight could be given to ClientEarth’s witness evidence, which did not amount to expert evidence. Secondly, that evidence did not support a prima facie case that there is a universally accepted methodology as to the means by which Shell might be able to achieve its reductions targets. This meant it was very difficult to treat what was said as providing a proper evidential basis for alleging no reasonable board of directors could properly conclude that the pathway to achievement is the one they adopted. Thirdly, ClientEarth accepted the directors do have policies and targets to achieve net zero. Its case ignored the fact that the management of a business of the size and complexity of that of Shell will require the directors to take into account a range of competing considerations, the proper balancing of which is classic management decision with which the court is ill-equipped to interfere. (Judgment paragraphs 46 to 48.)
As to the Milieudefensie ruling, the Dutch court apparently accepted that Shell is not currently acting in an unlawful manner and recognised that it is a matter for Shell as to how it exercises its discretion to comply with reduction obligations imposed by Dutch law. There was no prima facie case that the directors had breached their duties in respect of the Dutch order. (Paragraphs 49 to 54.)
As to the relief sought, ClientEarth had failed to make out a prima facie case that the court should grant this. A mandatory injunction was sought that Shell (a) adopt and implement a strategy to manage climate risk in compliance with its statutory duties and (b) comply immediately with the Dutch Order. This was too imprecise to be suitable for enforcement. A declaration was also sought - that the directors had breached their duties in the manner described. Whilst this did not suffer from imprecision, it was difficult to see what legitimate purpose it would fulfil. It was not the court’s function to express views as to the directors’ conduct which have no substantive effect and which fulfil no legally relevant purpose. The proper forum for generating those types of view as to the directors’ conduct was by vote of the members in general meeting. (Paragraphs 55 to 59.)
It was appropriate also to have regard to certain discretionary factors in section 263 of the Act. These pointed towards there being no prima facie case for granting permission. (paragraphs 60 to 70.)
In a costs judgment of August 31, 2023 the High Court confirmed its refusal of ClientEarth’s application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. In November 2023 the Court of Appeal refused ClientEarth permission to appeal, bringing the litigation to an end.""" ;

The CAP guidance, “Gambling and lotteries advertising: protecting under-18s”, stated that animated content and graphics could contribute to the impression that material was designed to appeal to under-18s. It stated that ads should avoid using child-like background imagery, such as that common in nursery rhymes or children’s stories. We considered Halloween and the traditions surrounding it were likely to have strong appeal for children. Furthermore, the style of cartoon imagery used in the ad, which included trees with crooked and curly silhouettes; a smiling, carved pumpkin glowing warmly from within and text which resembled slime was reminiscent of children’s cartoons and story books. We also considered that the term “monster” was likely to appeal to children. For those reasons, we considered the ad was likely to be of strong appeal to children. We considered it would have been acceptable for the ad to have appeared in a medium where under-18s, for all intents and purposes, could be entirely excluded from the audience. That would apply in circumstances where those who saw the ad had been robustly age-verified as being 18 or older, such as through marketing lists which had been validated by payment data or credit checking. However, because Facebook was a media environment where users self-verified on customer sign-up and did not use robust age-verification, we considered Buzz Bingo had not excluded under-18s from the audience with the highest level of accuracy required for ads where their content was likely to appeal strongly to under-18s. We acknowledged the steps Buzz Bingo had taken in response to the complaint but, for the reasons stated above, we nevertheless concluded that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code.The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 16.1 and 16.3.12 (Gambling)." ;

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but challenging different carbon credit projects. The REDD+ 2252 project, which is the subject of the lawsuit, overlaps the areas of 5 State Agro-Extractivist Settlement Projects (PEAEX). These PEAEX are public lands, whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 2252 generates REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and increased forest carbon stocks), was certified by an international company and has been established since 2016 to generate carbon credits for thirty years. Companies and individuals are sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of rural properties where it is located. The DPE-PA alleges irregularities in the property registrations that make up the project, and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. In addition, the mayor of Portel issued a Public Utility Decree authorising its operation, which the DPE-PA argues is unconstitutional. It is emphasised that the project was implemented without a prior technical study. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, that they did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and the concession of public forests and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. It argues that the defendants' behaviour entails the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) the recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) the suspension of Project 2252 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 2252 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel." ;

January 13, 2020, Judge Philippe Colelough concluded on appeal that the activists had acted proportionately to the imminence of climate danger and waived the fine. He wrote, \"Because of the insufficient measures taken to date in Switzerland, whether they be economic or political, the average warming will not diminish nor even stabilize, it will increase,\" the judge explained. \"In view of this, the tribunal considers that the imminence of danger is established. . . .

It also stated that only in exceptional circumstances may marketing communications feature alcohol being drunk by anyone in their working environment. The ad featured a woman dressed in overalls looking into the open bonnet of a car in an enclosed space accompanied by text which stated, “Working hard or hardly working?” The ASA therefore considered the post would be understood as being set in the location of a car garage with a mechanic at work. We also considered in that context, that although the car was stationary, it would be expected that a mechanic would operate machinery and potentially would have to drive the car to manoeuvre it while working on it. We considered the mechanic was therefore in a location and engaging in activities in which consuming alcohol would be unsafe.In the foreground of the image, there was a bottle of Smokehead Whisky on the ground in the garage. While we acknowledged that the post did not show the mechanic drinking from the bottle, we noted that the bottle of whisky was partially full, and, as such, we considered that gave the impression that the mechanic had been drinking the whisky while at work. We considered that the reference to “hardly working” also added to that impression. We welcomed Smokehead Whisky’s removal of the ad. However, given the setting, we concluded that the ad linked alcohol with activities and locations in which drinking would be unsafe and was therefore irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules18.1218.12Marketing communications must not link alcohol with activities or locations in which drinking would be unsafe or unwise.Marketing communications must not link alcohol with the use of potentially dangerous machinery or driving. Marketing communications may feature sporting and other physical activities (subject to other rules in this section; for example, appeal to under-18s or link with daring or aggression) but must not imply that those activities have been undertaken after the consumption of alcohol.and18.1318.13Only in exceptional circumstances may marketing communications feature alcohol being drunk by anyone in their working environment.(Alcohol)." ;

The MPF alleges that the defendant’s occupation of the land was illegal, as it was part of an Agro-Extractivist Settlement Project (PAE) owned and managed by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and occupied by traditional extractivist communities. This CPA is one of 22 lawsuits filed by the MPF as a result of an investigation conducted under Civil Inquiry No. 1.13.000.001719/2015-49 into illegal deforestation within the Antimary Agro-Extractivist Settlement Project (PAE), though each case involves different defendants. The lawsuit is based, among other things, on Brazilian environmental law concerning the constitutional protection of the environment, allegations of deforestation, propter rem civil liability for environmental damage (including climate damage), and collective moral damages. It also references the unauthorized emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) caused by the illegal deforestation, calculated at 160,574.33 tons of carbon dioxide, which directly contribute to Brazil's deviation from its climate goals—placing it out of step with both national and international commitments established under the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC) (Federal Law 12.187/2009) and the Paris Agreement (promulgated by Federal Decree 9.073/2017)." ;

The first TV ad featured a choir singing Christmas carols in a hall. A woman was playing the piano whilst also watching a football game on her phone. When a goal was scored in the football game, Peter Crouch, who was conducting the choir, turned round to lead a Mexican wave with the audience. Peter Crouch appeared in various other clips in the ad, including celebrating on stage with the choir and being turned away from a pub because it was full. Another scene showed on-screen text that stated, “COMPLETELY FREE BET BUILDER ON ALL ENGLAND GAMES”. The ad ended with a scene of a plate with Peter Crouch on it and text that stated, “PADDY POWER WHERE WERE YOU IN 22?”. During the ad, a voice-over stated, “You hear that? That’s the sound of Christmas and the world cup colliding. So come on all ye faithful, let’s be having ya. Glory to the king of headbutts. Knit those kits. Cross those sprouts. Stuff those turkeys. And attack those carols. Cause from this day we’ll forever ask where were you in twenty-two.\" Another voice-over stated, “Celebrate with a completely free bet builder on all England games. Paddy Power, where were you in twenty-two?” b. The second TV ad was a shortened version of ad (a), but featured the same scenes of Peter Crouch conducting the choir and celebrating with them on stage. It also ended with the scene of a plate with Peter Crouch on it and text that stated, “PADDY POWER WHERE WERE YOU IN 22?”." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "Not upheld The BCAP Code stated that ads for gambling products must not be likely to be of strong appeal to children (aged 0-15) or young persons (aged 16 and 17), especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture. They must not include a person or character whose example was likely to be followed by those aged under 18 years or who had strong appeal to those aged under 18. The ASA expected advertisers to provide evidence that they had identified what persons or characters were generally known for outside the context of an ad, and had used appropriate sources of data and information to assess their likely level of appeal to under-18s. The ad promoted Paddy Power’s free ‘Bet Builder’ on England matches in the 2022 FIFA World Cup and prominently featured Peter Crouch. Joint CAP and BCAP Advertising Guidance - Gambling and lotteries advertising: protecting under-18s (the B/CAP Guidance) - said that some activities, which included betting ads for football, were considered to have strong appeal to under-18s and were therefore prohibited unless steps had been taken to limit the potential for the ad to appeal strongly to under-18s. This included limiting the use of people who were likely to have strong appeal to under-18s. We therefore considered whether Peter Crouch had strong appeal to under-18s. We noted Peter Crouch was a retired football player who had not played professionally since 2019. We considered that meant he was not long retired from playing competitive football. However, in the year that he retired, he played in six games for Burnley in the Premier League, all of which he came on as a substitute. Prior to that, since 2011, he played for Stoke City in the Premier League. Particularly in his later years at the club, a large number of his appearances were as a substitute. During his earlier football career, we understood that Peter Crouch played for Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool and Aston Villa. He also played for England from 2005 until 2010. We therefore considered that, although during his earlier career he would have been widely recognisable, since 2011 he played for less popular clubs and, as a result, would not have been of strong appeal to under-18s due to his career as a footballer at the time the ads were broadcast. Since his retirement from football, he had been associated with a number of TV programmes and other media roles. We therefore assessed the appeal he was likely to have based on those associations. He did not have public profiles on Facebook, TikTok or Twitch and he had not posted on his Instagram for a long time. In addition, notwithstanding that Twitter was a media environment where users self-verified on customer sign-up and did not use robust age-verification, we considered that the evidence demonstrated that he had a very small number of followers on Twitter who were aged under 18. We therefore considered that his social media profile was unlikely to make him of strong appeal to under-18s. We noted he had been involved in a number of TV programmes, which included Save Our Beautiful Game, Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer and Crouchy’s Year-Late Euros: Live, as well as being a football pundit on BT Sport. We considered that those programmes were primarily aimed at adult audiences. Similarly, his podcast was aimed at an adult audience, with very few children in the audience, and his commercial partnerships were with adult focused brands. We noted he was also a panellist on season two of The Masked Dancer, which was shown on Saturdays at 6.30 pm on ITV from September to October 2022, and was therefore a recent activity. We understood that the programme, which featured a panel of celebrities guessing the identity of celebrities dancing whilst dressed in costume, was a family entertainment programme. It was light-hearted and involved brightly coloured and elaborate costumes, dancing and popular music. The total viewing figures of children who watched any of the eight episodes in the series, taken from BARB data, was 8.5 million. Whilst children who watched more than one episode were counted separate times, we nonetheless considered that the data showed the programme was of appeal to children. Furthermore, we understood that Peter Crouch himself, and many of the other celebrities involved in the show had expressed that their own children enjoyed the show. Additionally, Newsround, a BBC news programme for children, had published a number of articles about the programme which demonstrated they considered it was of interest to them. We therefore considered that while the programme had a broad audience demographic and was not more popular with children than adults, it nonetheless attracted a significant number of under-18s to watch it. We considered that in some circumstances an appearance by an individual on a programme that was watched by a significant number of under-18s might provide evidence that the person was of strong appeal to children and young people. The B/CAP Guidance stated that gambling advertisers were advised to avoid featuring persons or characters with obvious and direct links to under-18s, including a current or recent children’s TV personality. A further example given in the Guidance of a person likely to be of ‘strong’ appeal to under-18s included a retired sportsperson who has moved into presenting/broadcasting relating to that sport, but also into other areas, like youth-oriented reality TV. However, in this case we considered it was relevant that Peter Crouch appeared as one of four panellists, that the programme was of broad demographic appeal and that there was no evidence that his role in the programme had led to him being viewed in an aspirational or influential way by under-18s. This was supported by the evidence provided by Paddy Power in relation to his social media profile. We therefore considered that his appearance in a number of TV programmes, including The Masked Dancer, was unlikely to make him of strong appeal to under-18s. Finally, we considered whether the Christmas focus of the ad made it more likely to appeal strongly to under-18s. Although the ads made clear references to Christmas, we considered that there was nothing in relation to Christmas that would have been of strong appeal to children, such as depicting Santa Claus. We therefore concluded that the ads were not of strong appeal to children or young persons. We investigated the ads under BCAP Code rules17.417.4Advertisements for gambling must not:and17.4.517.4.5be likely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture.They must not include a person or character whose example is likely to be followed by those aged under 18 years or who has a strong appeal to those aged under 18.Where appropriate steps have been taken to limit the potential for an advertisement to appeal strongly to under-18s, this rule does not prevent the advertising of gambling products associated with activities that are themselves of strong appeal to under-18s (for instance, certain sports or playing video games).BCAP has publishedguidanceon the application of the rule, including for advertising of gambling products associated with activities that are themselves of strong appeal to under-18s.(Gambling), but did not find them in breach." ;

They said Peter Crouch’s professional career as a footballer ended in 2019 and this could not be described as a ‘recent’ retirement. They referred to the CAP and BCAP guidance Gambling and lotteries advertising: protecting under-18s, which stated that long-retired footballers who were now known for punditry were of low-risk of strong appeal to children. They said that although Peter Crouch made a number of appearances for the England national team, the last of those was in 2010. Given the considerable time that had elapsed, they did not believe it would be reasonable to deduce that his international career had retained residual appeal to children in 2022. They believed Peter Crouch was more widely recognised as a football pundit and entertainer than as a former Premier League footballer. At the time the ads were shown, Peter Crouch was 41. Paddy Power believed Peter Crouch’s media profile was consistent with that of a 41-year-old man and was not likely to be aspirational to under-18s in anyway. In terms of his post-international footballing career, from 2011 until his retirement, Peter Crouch played for Stoke City or Burnley. These were not large clubs with significant national or international supporter bases, or which were likely to have a large following of young people outside of their local area. He made six appearances for Burnley in the Premier League in the final year of his career, all of which were as a substitute. Until 2021, he held the record for the highest number of substitute appearances in the Premier League and 2014 was the last season he made more starting appearances than substitute appearances. As a result, he spent significantly less time on the pitch than many of his comparable peers, which further reduced the likelihood of his appeal to children, when the ads were broadcast, as a result of his playing career. When he played at Stoke City, the club was relegated from the Premier League in his penultimate year there and, as such, he spent a period playing in the Championship before signing for Burnley. Therefore, his very limited number of appearances for Burnley, the number of substitution appearances he made and Stoke City’s relegation to a lower league at the end of his career there, reduced his notoriety as a Premier League footballer to children and young people at the time the ads were broadcast. Peter Crouch did not have public accounts on TikTok, Facebook or Twitch at the time the ads were broadcast, and his Instagram account had not been updated since 2014. He did have a public account on Twitter that, at the time the ads were seen, had almost 1.5 million followers. The demographic data from September to December 2022 showed that 0.46% of his followers were aged 13-17 years. Other data showed that the top topics his followers were interested in were markedly adult themes, and included: domestic and US politics, business, finance, technology and government institutions. They believed that his limited profile on social media reduced his appeal to children by default. They said they also considered the audience demographic of the TV programmes Peter Crouch was predominantly known for. He appeared as a panellist for series two of The Masked Dancer. They provided Broadcaster’s Audience Research Board (BARB) data which they said showed that the programme was of more appeal to an older demographic than a younger one. They provided the audience index status of the programme which they believe demonstrated that the programme would not have been categorised as being ‘likely to appeal to children’. They understood that the show was intended to appeal to a broad range of ages and demographics and therefore its panel of judges and featured contestants were carefully selected to appeal to a range of people. They did not believe that watching a TV programme which had a large and diverse cast denoted a specific interest in Peter Crouch, nor lead to an increase in his appeal to children. Peter Crouch was a football pundit for BT Sport, which was a subscription-only paid service. They did not believe that detailed pundit-based discussions around tactics and team performance were of strong appeal to children. They provided BARB data that they believed supported that this was the case. Peter Crouch featured in the grass-roots football documentary series Save Our Beautiful Game, which covered issues related, in a serious and adult tone, to the financial struggle to keep a lower league club alive. The show was shown on Discovery+ and Amazon Prime, both of which were subscription-only services. Peter Crouch had also appeared in his own TV shows in 2020 and 2021, Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer and Crouchy’s Year-Late Euros: Live, respectively. Both shows were broadcast after the watershed and were targeted at an adult audience. They provided BARB data that they believed supported that was the case. Peter Crouch also hosted the podcast That Peter Crouch Podcast. Paddy Power provided demographic data of the podcasts’ listeners which they believed supported that it had a distinctly low appeal to children. The podcast had an Instagram and YouTube account and the demographic data for those showed that 1.5% of the podcast’s Instagram followers in the previous 30 days were aged between 13 and 17 years and that 0.1% of people who had engaged with the podcast’s YouTube channel in the previous 28 days were aged between 13 and 17 years. Paddy Power also reviewed Peter Crouch’s endorsements. He had partnerships with Ted Baker, L’Oreal and Carphone Warehouse. However, they believed those were all targeted at adults. In summer of 2022, Peter Crouch launched an alcoholic drink with Brewdog. They believed that further demonstrated he had an overwhelmingly adult commercial appeal. He has also published a range of autobiographical-style books, all of which were targeted at an adult audience and was a columnist for the Daily Mail, a newspaper that was targeted at adults. Commenting on the World Cup and Christmas themes in the ad, they said that in 2022, for the first time, the World Cup was set across the Christmas period. The voice-over in the ads placed them within that context from the outset. The central theme of the ads was the World Cup rather than Christmas and the purpose of the ads was to advertise Paddy Power’s offer of a ‘completely free Bet Builder on all England Games’ in the World Cup. They did not believe that the concept of Christmas in and of itself was likely to be of strong appeal to children. They took care to ensure the ads only referred to aspects of Christmas that were of strong appeal to adults. The carol singers depicted were all obviously adults and the organist was an older woman. They sang a well-known football chant which was popular with an older demographic of football fan. Although the ad showed a Christmas tree, it was placed in the background of the shot rather than being prominently positioned. It was decorated in a muted fashion and not in a bright and colourful manner that was likely to appeal to children. Similarly, the Christmas lights were deliberately dimmed rather than being bright and colourful. The ads featured a pub setting, which was a context that was unlikely to appeal to children. The ads depicted Christmas tropes, which they believed resonated with adults, such as ugly knitted Christmas wear. They did not depict any of the features of Christmas generally associated with children or young people, such as Christmas stockings, new toys or leaving food out for Santa Claus. The ad carefully weaved adult concepts of Christmas with famous sporting moments which were only likely to be recognised by adults, either because they were adult in tone or referred to famous historical footballing moments. The footballing scene depicted in lights took place at the World Cup final in 2006. They did not believe that the Christmas context of the ads made Peter Crouch more likely to appeal to under-18s. Clearcast said Paddy Power provided them with a list of Peter Crouch’s media activities, endorsement, and former and current projects, and they were assured that all projects were aimed at an adult market. They endorsed Paddy Power’s comments that both Peter Crouch’s own social media demographics, and that of his podcasts, demonstrated that he had low appeal to under-18s and that children only made up a small minority of the audiences of the shows that he featured in, including The Masked Dancer. They also endorsed Paddy Power’s comments that the ads did not conflate Christmas and festive activities with youth appeal, and particularly highlighted that the ads were in line with previously broadcast betting ads that featured Christmas iconography. They were satisfied that Peter Crouch and the Christmas setting did not have strong appeal to under-18s or youth culture, and therefore the ads complied with the Code." ;

The complainant argued that such claims implied that the milk had no effect on the climate. Because this environmental claim could not be substantiated, it allegedly violated articles 2 and 3 of the Code for Environmental Advertising (MRC). The Committee was of the view that an average consumer would interpret these claims in the sense that the production of the products had no impact on the climate in that adverse affects were completely cancelled out. The Committee referred to a previous ruling on Shell \"Drive CO2 neutral\" 1. After giving the defendant the opportunity to provide more information in an interim decision, the Committee found that Arla had not demonstrated the absolute certainty required with regard to the full and permanent offsetting of emissions through its forest projects. Thus, the accuracy of an absolute claim such as \"climate neutral\" had not been demonstrated as required by article 3 MRC. The advertising was therefore in breach of article 2 MRC. Arla subsequently appealed this decision, arguing that it met all the established and highest standards for claiming climate neutrality. Specifically, Arla stated that its \"climate neutral\" claim was a relative and not an absolute one, as the claim related to a label and that it was entitled to use this label for its products. Therefore, Arla argued that this case differentiated from previous cases which had involved absolute claims. The appeal body confirmed the decision of the RCC in part. It found that Arla's statements were misleading to the extent that there was no clarification that the claim specifically related to the label. Thus, the appeal body found the statements to be misleading within article 2 MRC and in conjunction with article 8.3(a),(c) of the Dutch Advertising Code. The appeal body found no violation of article 2 MRC." ;

The lawsuit is based, among other things, on Brazilian environmental law concerning the constitutional protection of the environment, the accusation of deforestation, propter rem civil liability for environmental damage, including climate damage, and collective moral damages. It also mentions the unauthorized emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) caused by the illegal deforestation of the area, calculated at 119,944.34 tons of carbon dioxide and which are directly related to the Brazilian State's departure from its climate goals, out of step with national and international commitments made by Brazil in the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009) and in the Paris Agreement (promulgated by Federal Decree 9.073/2017).

Upheld The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register) were permitted in marketing communications for foods. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food, or ingredient, and health. The ASA understood that the function of skin was to provide a permeable barrier against the external environment. We considered that claims which stated or implied a beneficial physiological effect on, or change to, the structure of the skin to aid in its function of providing a barrier were health claims for the purposes of the Code. In contrast, claims which related to temporary improvements in the appearance or maintenance of normal appearance of the skin and did not refer to a beneficial physiological effect on a specific function of skin were, therefore, cosmetic claims, rather than health claims. Cosmetic claims were not required to be authorised on the GB Register; instead, advertisers must hold evidence to support such claims. We considered that assessing whether claims were health claims or cosmetic claims required an assessment of the specific claims made and the overall context of the ad. Although Kollo believed that the video portion of the ad made claims for collagen in general, in the introductory section the presenter mentioned Kollo by name and was shown holding the product. We therefore considered that consumers would understand that the claims related to the product.We considered that the claims \"help maintain the elasticity and firmness of your skin” and “reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles” were likely to be understood by consumers as cosmetic claims about the product’s temporary beneficial effect on the appearance of skin, specifically in improving its texture and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. We also considered that in the context of an ad that did not refer to hair growth or prevention of hair loss, consumers would be likely to interpret the claim \"thicker hair\" as a cosmetic claim that the product could lead to hair which appeared plumped or thicker in diameter rather than an increase in the number of hair strands on the head. We therefore assessed the evidence provided by Kollo in support of the cosmetic claims in the ad: “help maintain the elasticity and firmness of your skin”, “reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles” and “thicker hair”. A consumer panel study evaluated the effect of a daily 10 g dose of Naticol on 52 female participants from the Tokyo area in Japan over 30 days. Participants were asked to self-evaluate wrinkles, skin hydration, firmness and brightness after two and four weeks. We considered that subjective responses to a consumer perception questionnaire did not constitute adequate evidence for the objective claims in the ad. We also had concerns that the survey cohort was small and of a limited demographic that was not representative of the general population. A double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical study carried out by a French laboratory assessed 40 female subjects aged between 54 and 64 years. Twenty randomly assigned participants took 10g Naticol daily for 12 weeks (the “intervention group”). The other 20 participants were given a placebo of maltodextrin (the “placebo group”). The trial measured skin elasticity at the start and end of the trial period using a cutometer and assessed wrinkles after 6 and 12 weeks by using specialised software to analyse rubber impressions taken of the skin. Participants and investigators were also questioned about perceived wrinkle reduction and whether they thought the product was effective against signs of aging. The study reported a significant increase in skin smoothing (9.37%) in the periorbital zone and in skin extensibility (23.7%) in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. The survey of participants and investigators reported perceived wrinkle reduction in 79% of the intervention group compared to 58% in the placebo group. However, we considered that 20 participants in the intervention group and 20 in the control group did not constitute a sufficiently large sample size. We also had concerns that the study cohort, made up of female participants between 54 and 64 years of age was not representative of the general population and the study had not been published or peer-reviewed. Furthermore, we noted one of the inclusion criteria for the participants was for them to have “periorbital lines of medium to moderate severity corresponding at least to level 3 of the classification of Lemperle”. We understood the Lemperle scale defined level 3 as “Moderately deep wrinkles”. We considered that a study that measured effects on moderate lines would not necessarily be relevant to substantiate an efficacy claim for “fine lines and wrinkles”. Three further studies evaluated the effects of Naticol. In two of the studies participants took a 2.5 g dose and in the third they took a 5 g dose. We considered that those studies were not relevant to the advertised claims because they did not relate to the advertised 10 mg dose. We also considered that a summary of an in vitro study of collagen synthesis was not relevant substantiation for the claims. Kollo did not provide any evidence in support of the claim “thicker hair”.For those reasons, we concluded that the claims “help maintain the elasticity and firmness of your skin”, “reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles” and “thicker hair” had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 2. Upheld We considered that the claim “your skin being more hydrated” would be understood to mean that the product would have a beneficial physiological effect on the skin’s function as a barrier, in particular by protecting it against dehydration. Similarly, we considered that the claim “stronger nails” would be understood to mean that the product would alter the physical structure of a person’s nails so as to make them stronger and less susceptible to breakage. We therefore considered that the claims were specific health claims for the purposes of the Code. Specific health claims used in ads must be authorised on the GB Register, and could only be made for the nutrient, substance, food or food category for which they had been authorised. However, we had not seen evidence that the above claims were authorised on the GB Register in relation to either collagen or the Kollo product. We considered that the claim “improved joint health” would be understood to mean the product had a general beneficial effect on the joints. The Code required that general health claims, which were claims that referred to the general benefits of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health related well-being, must be accompanied by a specific authorised health claim. However, the claim was not accompanied by any relevant, specific authorised health claim as was required. Because we had not seen any evidence that the specific health claims (“your skin being more hydrated” and “stronger nails”) were authorised on the GB Register and the general health claim (“improved joint health”) was not accompanied by a specific authorised health claim, we concluded that they breached the Code.

After the ruling, Shell had replaced \"CO2 neutral\" with \"CO2 compensation.\" The complainants argued that these terms were synonymous and that an average consumer would understand the compensation claims as undoing the climatic harm caused by fossil fuels. But Shell had not provided the scientific evidence that the promised offsetting actually led to this result in practice. The Committee found this claim not to be different from the previously assessed \"CO2 neutral\" claim. Thus, the Committee found the claim to be misleading and in breach of articles 2 and 3 MRC. Shell appealed the ruling and argued that the Committee's interpretation of the claim put Shell in an impossible evidential position which would hinder Shell to communicate about its CO2 offset program.

A label above her head that stated “Your brain age: 22” appeared throughout the ad.

Upheld The ASA noted that the video of the “old creative” that GM Unicorn Ltd had provided, had a number of differences to the ad seen by the complainant, including an increase to Emma’s “brain age” throughout the ad. We therefore based the assessment of the ad on the screenshots sent by the complainant. Nevertheless, we were satisfied that the images provided sufficient content to allow us to make an assessment on the issues raised. The ad, which was for a game app about interactive roleplaying, including of a sexual nature, featured an animated female character with her breasts partially exposed. In the initial frame of the ad, the female character was shown to be overweight and told by her husband to “Make yourself more sexy”. She was then shown to alter her appearance by plumping up her lips, shrinking her waist and enlarging her breasts, while the text “IMPROVE YOURSELF!” appeared above her head. We understood that the changes to the character’s appearance alluded to obtaining cosmetic surgery and other cosmetic interventions such as liposuction, breast implants and lip fillers. The text “IMPROVE YOURSELF!” implied that having cosmetic surgery and other interventions was a positive and desirable change, which irresponsibly created pressure to conform to an idealised gender-stereotypical body. Furthermore, the portrayal of the female character changing her appearance to appease her husband amplified a harmful gender stereotype by objectifying women and was likely to cause serious and widespread offence. We assessed GM Unicorn’s response which stated that the stereotypes depicted in the ad were intended to be satirical. We considered that in the absence of further context of the My Fantasy gameplay, viewers were unlikely to interpret the ad as a self-aware parody. We also considered that the narrative and humour in the ad derived specifically from the use of the gender stereotype. We did not consider that the use of humour in the ad mitigated the effect of the harmful stereotype; indeed it was central to it, because the humour derived from the audiences’ familiarity with the stereotype being portrayed. We concluded that the ad was irresponsible, likely to cause serious and widespread offence, and included a gender stereotype in a way that was likely to cause harm. The ad therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).  2. Upheld The ad should not have been served in any context because its content was irresponsible, harmful and likely to cause serious and widespread offence. Notwithstanding that, we understood the advertised game had an age rating of 17+ on Google Play and a sexual theme. In that context, we expected GM Unicorn Corporation to have targeted ads for the game to people aged 18 years and over by using age-verification measures including interest-based targeting factors which described an adult audience and excluded a child audience. We had not seen any evidence that GM Unicorn Corporation had taken steps to target ads for the game away from those under 18 years of age. We therefore concluded that the ad had been irresponsibly targeted. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility). " ;

GM Unicorn Corporation Ltd confirmed that the ad in question was no longer appearing. They said that My Fantasy was an interactive story app that featured imaginary scenarios related to love and romance. Users were presented with different stories and had to make decisions within them, each with their own consequences. They said the app, besides entertainment, attempted to promote inclusivity, freedom of choice in relationships and the ability to take responsibility. One of the ways it did that was by reflecting stereotypes and socially controversial issues, in order to expose them and allow users to assess them in a humorous, non-judgemental environment. The complainant had provided the ASA with a series of screenshots of the ad. We therefore asked GM Unicorn for a full electronic copy of the ad. They responded that they were unable to provide the ad in question, however, they sent a copy of a similar video which was labelled “old creative”. GM Unicorn’s comments below relate to the “old creative” video. They said it exposed and ridiculed, rather than promoted, toxic relationships, body-shaming, sexualising and objectifying women, gender stereotypes, and making poor life choices. Unlike the named main character Emma, her “husband” was nameless because he was intended to represent a stereotype. The husband, who suddenly decided that his wife was not attractive enough, proposed to give her money to make herself more attractive. They said this was intended to expose the stereotype that a man may do practically anything in a relationship and automatically be forgiven if he was rich. The poor conduct continued when Emma happily accepted a credit card and instantly forgot about the insult. The situation was depicted as comically absurd, peaking when the joking text “Improve Yourself” appeared near the icon “Your brain age: 22” which was shown to increase with each decision, such as enlarging her lips to the maximum, making her left breast larger than the right one, reducing her waist to the minimum, and enormously widening her hips. After all these steps were taken, her brain age was increased to 65, to demonstrate how “wise” the hypothetical user had become. This was intended to allude to the “expanded brain” meme. Ironically, her husband then said to her that he was “all for natural beauty” and she was seen to shed waterfall-like tears. In relation to the targeting of the ad, they considered that the ad was appropriate for distribution to various age categories. While the app was designed primarily for an adult audience, the fantasy love and romance stories featured no explicit content and did not have a sexual theme. They further said that the stories in the app were quite lengthy and comprehensive, which needed prolonged and engaged interaction. That resonated predominantly with an adult audience. The relevant age restrictions were stated in the app’s description on apps stores, as well as the app’s terms and conditions. Furthermore, they said that the app’s style and theme deterred children from downloading and engaging with it. Therefore, even though the app was adult-oriented, they considered that the occasional delivery of age-appropriate ads that did not contain explicit or harmful content was not in breach of the Code, provided there were also deterrents in place that would prevent children from accessing adult-oriented content within the app. It also made no economic sense to target children if the target audience was adult. GM Unicorn referenced three of ASA rulings in support of their arguments. Zynga Inc., the app developer of Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells, and Chartboost Inc., the ad network that served the ad, provided a joint response. They explained that third-party ads which appeared in Zynga’s games were typically served into their advertising space using a number of ad networks. The ad in question was served via Chartboost Exchange, their programmatic ad exchange which utilised real-time bidding on advertising space. They said that this process was almost entirely automated, and it was not possible for either Zynga or Chartboost to have advanced sight of, or review, every ad served. Chartboost said that their contracts with advertisers and other platforms required those parties to ensure that their ads complied with all applicable laws and regulations, including Chartboost’s own policies which prohibited obscene, offensive and indecent content. They also used tools to filter out and block certain ad categories, including provocative or suggestive imagery, and they made tools available to publishers that allowed them to filter out specific ad categories. Zynga said that they used those tools to block content which they considered inappropriate for the players of their games, taking into account factors such as the target audience of each game, which could be different to the game’s age rating displayed in app stores. In their view, the age rating was just an indication of the gameplay content that was in the game and not a reflection of the actual player base the game was targeted at or who should play the game. Regarding Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells in particular, they said that the player base was predominantly adult, with the target audience aged 18 to 49 years. At the time the ad was served, the blocks on provocative or suggestive imagery and ads under the sexuality, dating and pornography categories should have prevented the ad from appearing in the game. However, they recognised that advertisers had ways to get around blocklists or filters such as misclassifying or renaming their ad, changing its URL, or using an agency. Zynga said they had received seven complaints about the ad and had blocked it from appearing in the game and other games in their portfolio. Chartboost also confirmed that they had blocked GM Unicorn Corporation’s ads for their apps My Fantasy and Passion: Romance Books Library from being served via their ad exchange. " ;

As a result, they had the lowest carbon emissions per passenger at 52 g carbon dioxide per revenue passenger kilometres (CO2/RPK). RPK was the number of seat kilometres flown by paying passengers – a figure that had been independently verified. They provided a copy of the report from which the figure had been taken. Wizz Air explained that they were actively renewing their fleet of aeroplanes – replacing the Airbus A320ceo aircraft with the Airbus A321neo, with a reduction in fuel consumption of 10% and a per-seat fuel improvement of 20%. The Airbus A321neo was the widest and most efficient single-aisle aircraft with the lowest fuel consumption per seat kilometre in its category. Additionally, the newer model gave a 50% reduction in noise compared to the older model. Wizz Air had invested in the research and development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). They were an equity investor in SAF, having invested in two companies developing the fuel, and had concluding offtake agreements to purchase SAF once it had been produced. They aimed to reach 10% SAF usage by 2030, exceeding the ReFuel EU Aviation Regulation requirements. They held membership of the Alliance for Zero Emission Aviation (AZEA) and the Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuels Value Chain Industrial Alliance (RLCF) to ensure investment and deployment of future technologies in the field. As part of its environment, social and governance strategy (ESG) Wizz Air had established an independent Sustainability and Culture Committee and appointed a dedicated ESG Officer, who was a member of the senior leadership team.

If it could be emulated, marketing communications must not depict a driving practice that is likely to condone or encourage a breach of those rules of the Highway Code that are legal requirements if that driving practice seems to take place on a public road or in a public space. Vehicles' capabilities may be demonstrated on a track or circuit if it is obviously not in use as a public highway. The Code also stated that advertisers must not make speed or acceleration the main message of their ads. The ASA understood that the motorbike featured in the ad was a high-performance vehicle designed for use in professional racing as implied by the reference to the “Supersport segment” and we acknowledged that the image appeared to be from a racetrack. However, it was seen in a regional newspaper which was likely to have readers who were not professional racers but owned motorbikes, or could purchase the BMW S 1000. We understood that model was available for purchase commercially, and could be ridden on public highways. Although the ad’s text included the bike’s specifications and capabilities, it also stated “limits are there to be broken” and we considered that would be understood by readers as a reference to the speed limits set on a public highway and an encouragement to break those limits. In connection with the claims “BUILT TO CHALLENGE”, “the new BMW S 1000 supports you with uncompromising power” and “Are you ready to challenge?” we considered the ad suggested that the bike could push or exceed the boundaries of safe driving and that readers were being invited to try to do so, due to the higher performance nature of the BMW S 1000. We considered readers were unlikely to associate such phrases with responsible driving behaviours. We also considered that the claims “limits are there to be broken” and “the whole design has been ergonomically optimised so you can surpass yourself in any race”, along with the invitation for readers to “challenge”, focused on the speeds the bike was capable of achieving. The ad had a slightly blurred appearance which we considered also suggested that the rider was travelling at speed and which added to the overall impression that speed was the main message of the ad. Because we considered the ad suggested that readers should push the boundaries of safe driving and made speed the main message of the ad, we concluded it condoned and encouraged unsafe driving and was irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 19.2 and 19.4 (Motoring)." ;

At the beginning of the ad the car was shown being loaded with items, before being driven at a moderate speed through quiet city streets. During the ad, the car was seen making turns into other streets on a number of occasions. The ASA noted that some of those turns were filmed with the camera passing the car, tracking in the opposite direction. We considered that while those camera shots created a sense of speed of movement, the actual speed of the car was not likely to be seen by viewers as excessive or irresponsible. We also considered that, during the cornering manoeuvres, the car was driven in a sensible and safe manner. We noted that after one scene of the car negotiating a corner, an internal shot of the car’s occupants showed the driver handling the steering wheel. However, we did not consider that viewers would interpret that shot as having depicted a steering correction, or as an indication of dangerous or irresponsible driving. At one point the car was shown moving from one side of the road to the other, coming into the view of the following camera. We noted that the shot of the car moving across the road did not directly follow a cornering manoeuvre, and there were no central lines in the road the car was being driven on. We considered that the car was driven in a safe manner, and at a reasonable speed, in that scene. We acknowledged that the ad was filmed in an urban setting and that the car was shown passing pedestrians, a basketball court and local shops. However, we did not consider that any of those scenes showed the car being driven in a dangerous, inconsiderate or irresponsible manner.

Upheld The ASA welcomed Repsol’s assurance that the ad would be removed. The CAP Code stated that unqualified claims could mislead if material information was omitted. The ad appeared within the FT’s digital energy newsletter and elsewhere on the FT website. It would therefore have been seen by both consumers, who may be interested in Repsol as a brand for the products and services they provide, and business readers, such as potential investors, partners and clients. We considered that both audiences would have an awareness that many companies in carbon-intensive industries, including the oil and gas sector, aimed to dramatically reduce their emissions in response to the climate crisis. In addition, both were increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of activities related to higher-carbon products and services, and would be interested in seeking out businesses, including oil and gas companies, who were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services, including towards achieving net zero emissions. However, we considered that consumers and many business readers were unlikely to be aware of the specific details of how companies planned to achieve this. We considered that both consumers and business readers were likely to interpret the claim, “At Repsol, we are developing biofuels and synthetic fuels to achieve net zero emissions”, in addition to the imagery of nature and the natural environment, as meaning that Repsol’s development of biofuels and synthetic fuels formed a significant element of their current activities that were making meaningful progress towards achieving net zero emissions. We acknowledged Repsol’s comments regarding their contribution to electrical charging, renewable generation capacity, and reductions in energy consumption and emissions in industrial centres in other facilities. However, notwithstanding current actions towards improving their environmental impact, we understood that a number of Repsol’s new biofuel and synthetic fuel initiatives were not yet in operation. Furthermore, Repsol’s carbon emissions stood at 171 million tonnes of CO2e in 2021 (50% of the emissions of the United Kingdom in 2021, 346.7 Mt CO2e). They produced approximately 600,000 barrels of oil per day. We also understood that Repsol had a substantial oil and gas exploration strategy, owning an interest in 40,660 acres (gross) of oil and gas development and exploration across Europe, Latin America, North America, Africa, and Asia and Oceania. We acknowledged that Repsol’s hydrocarbons production focused on gas and understood the reasons for that. We also acknowledged that oil would continue to play a legitimate role in the context of energy transition in the future. However, we understood that their focus on the production of biofuels and synthetic fuels to achieve net zero emissions was a fraction of their business activities when compared to their substantial, ongoing, and expanding fossil fuel production. Furthermore, notwithstanding the reasons given for the continued production of oil and gas, we noted that the ad focused solely on an initiative the company suggested would deliver their net zero goal (with no timeframe given) when at the same time, Repsol was continuing to emit notable levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses and would do so for many years into the future. We understood that consumers could access information about Repsol’s general business activities and plans on their website. However, further information to contextualise how and when Repsol would achieve net zero emissions, and the role that the development of biofuels would play in that plan, was material to consumers’ understanding of the ad’s overall message, and should have appeared in the ad itself. We therefore concluded that the ad omitted material information and was misleading. On this point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading Advertising), and 11.1 (Environmental Claims). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear. We acknowledged Repsol’s target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and their objectives regarding emissions from operating assets, net emissions and methane emissions. We also acknowledged their aims and investments regarding biofuels and synthetic fuels. Further we noted the changes made to their investment process. We understood, however, that Repsol did not only accept investment opportunities based on carbon reducing activity. We acknowledged Repsol’s comment that there is no single solution for sustainability, and that renewable fuels are one element in the company’s strategy to reach net zero by 2050. However, while we agreed that synthetic fuels and biofuels could contribute towards Repsol’s goal of achieving net zero emissions, they would not as a single measure ‘achieve’ net zero emissions. We also considered that in the context of an ad making a claim based on initiatives to achieve net zero, the timeframe of 2050 to achieve that goal was material information that needed to be made clear to consumers. In the absence of any contextual information explaining that the initiative was part of a wider plan to achieve net zero by 2050, we concluded that the basis of the claim “At Repsol, we are developing biofuels and synthetic fuels to achieve net zero emissions” was not clear and it was likely to mislead as a result. On this point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1, 3.11 (Misleading Advertising), and 11.1 (Environmental Claims)." ;

Repsol said that by adding the message “Find out more about this and other projects”, accompanied by a button with the message “More information” at the end of the ad, the reader was invited to click and access Repsol’s website. Once accessed, the website provided further information and news related to the company’s global activity. They believed that it was impossible to maintain the attractiveness of the ad and place more information within it. Repsol explained that the ad was mainly designed for inclusion in the Financial Times (FT) digital energy newsletter sponsored by Repsol, aimed at an informed audience of users who subscribe to it and are interested in issues and news related to the energy sector. They acknowledged that the ad was also published elsewhere on the FT’s website. Repsol said that they opened Spain’s first electric charging point, and operated Spain’s largest public electric vehicle charging network. In addition, they are a significant operator in the electricity and gas market in Spain, with 1.5 million customers. They currently have an installed renewable generation capacity of more than 1,800 MW worldwide and plan to reach 6,000 MW by 2025 and 20,000 MW by 2030. They produce an average of approximately 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which nearly 70% is gas. Their hydrocarbons production is focused on gas since the fuel helps transition from higher-emissions coal to electricity production, thus speeding up the energy transition. They further stated that oil will still be needed in a more decarbonized world, even according to the International Energy Agency’s most aggressive scenarios. Repsol summarised that they have reduced energy consumption in their industrial centres by 20% in the period 2011-2022 and reduced emissions by more than 20% in all their facilities. 2. Repsol said they were aware that there is no single solution for sustainability. They explained that renewable fuels are one of the main elements in the company’s strategy to reach net zero by 2050. They aimed to reduce 55% of emissions from operated assets and 30% of net emissions by 2030. They also stated that they set a target for reducing their methane emissions intensity to 0.20% in 2025, which would be a reduction of 85%. Repsol said that they will allocate more than €5 billion in organic investment and that 35% of these investments will be allocated to low-carbon technologies and projects. The company has implemented a methodology to determine whether a new investment is in line with its decarbonisation targets, and any investment proposed to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors must include a report prepared by their Sustainability Department. In the second half of 2023 they are introducing a new biofuels facility that will supply 250,000 tons per year of advanced biofuels. The use of these fuels will make it possible to avoid emissions of 900,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. They also are preparing to build synthetic fuels and urban waste recovery plants and have partnered with Enerkem to develop a plant which will process around 400,000 tons of non-recyclable municipal solid waste to produce around 240,000 tons of renewable methanol (biomethanol). Repsol explained that renewable fuels make up 10% of their fuel sales in Spain and they expect to grow this aggressively. They have existing pilot projects in three cities which involve 100% biofuel pumps for fleet vehicles and have also launched a recent initiative to pay customers for their used cooking oil for incorporation into the processing of fatty residues. Repsol said they are committed to acting ethically and would remove the ad immediately." ;

A video on the advertiser’s YouTube account titled “Battle of the Bridge / Youth vs Experience vs IONIQ 5 / Who will prove faster?” and featured footballers from Chelsea FC, a brand partner of Hyundai, undertaking a series of challenges. Audio and text on-screen stated, “Both teams must complete the challenges within 18 minutes. That’s the time that it takes the IONIQ 5 to charge from 10-80%”. c.

Text further down the page stated, “Take charge with even more flexible charging solutions with IONIQ 5. Depending on your grid connection at home or the type of charging station you have access to, IONIQ 5 gives you a range of flexible charging possibilities aside from ultra-fast DC charging.

In the absence of any charger being specified in ad (b) we considered that the ad would give consumers the impression that this charge-rate could be achieved with any compatible charger. We understood from Hyundai that the information in ad (b) had been omitted in error and we welcomed their assurance that they had since removed the ad. We acknowledged that the evidence provided by Hyundai showed that, under standardised testing conditions (with a new battery and in a temperature-controlled environment with ambient temperatures of 22 and 25 degrees centigrade) the battery could be charged from 10% to 80% in under 18 minutes using a 350 kW charger. However, we understood that various real-world factors such as battery temperature, ambient temperature and age and condition of the battery, might affect the time it would take for a battery to charge to 80%. If any of those conditions were less than optimal, then charging times would likely take longer than 18 minutes. We understood that at the time of the ads, only one of the three available trim lines of the car had technology that was designed to maintain battery temperature at the most efficient level during vehicle usage and charging, which helped to support the battery charge time in varying weather conditions. However, we understood that battery temperature was one of several factors that could influence charging time. We would therefore expect Hyundai to qualify the charging claim with an explanation of the conditions under which the figures were achieved and that they may not reflect actual consumer experience. We considered that a further limitation that was likely to affect whether consumers were able to achieve the claimed charging time was the availability of 350 kW chargers. We considered that the average consumer may not have an awareness of the speed or availability of a 350 kW charger in comparison to other chargers, although we acknowledged that consumers interested in purchasing an electric vehicle would be likely to have some awareness that they may need to travel to access the network of ultra-fast charging points. We considered that ads (a) and (b) did not provide consumers with any contextual information regarding how the charging speed of a 350 kW charger differed from other charging options. In the absence of any specific limitations in those ads stating otherwise, we considered that the average consumer was likely to form the impression that it was relatively straightforward to access 350 kW chargers throughout the UK in public places. We noted that ad (c) included the description of 350 kW as an “ultra-fast charger” and provided information about alternative charging solutions which would have provided consumers with some context as to its comparable speed to other chargers. We understood from the Charge myHyundai website that, in April 2022, there were 37 ultra-fast 350 kW charging locations in Great Britain, six in the Republic of Ireland, limited numbers in Wales and Scotland and none in Northern Ireland. We concluded that because the ads omitted material information about the factors that could significantly affect the advertised charging time and the limitations in relation to the availability of 350 kW chargers, the claims that the Hyundai IONIQ 5 could charge from 10% to 80% charge “in 18 minutes” (ads (a) and (b)) or “less than 18 minutes” using a 350 kW charger (ad (c)) had not been substantiated and were misleading.

The transition to electric vehicles was fundamental to the UK's hopes of achieving its net zero targets. They said barriers still existed and they were aware that concerns around charge time were an important factor to consumers. They said the ads were looking to inform consumers about a fundamental feature of electric vehicles in general, making use of key performance data relating to the IONIQ 5 model specifically. They said this was intended to help address consumer concerns about charge times affecting longer journeys. Hyundai said they considered that it was essential that manufacturers were able to promote charge times in connection with electric vehicles so that consumers could compare different electric vehicles and to address key barriers to electric vehicle take-up, such as range and charging anxiety and a lack of awareness of the rollout of charging infrastructure. They provided the ASA with results of their internal factory testing of the charging times for both IONIQ 5 battery options (72.6 kWh and 58 kWh). They stated that testing established a time of 17 minutes and 16 seconds to charge the battery from 10% to 80% when using a 350 kW ultra-fast charger, and with the battery at temperatures of 22 and 25 degrees centigrade. They expressed that as 18 minutes for the purposes of the claims in the ads, to take a conservative approach. They were confident that claim of a 10-80% charge in 18 minutes using a 350 kW charger, was accurate and substantiated. They also provided information from YouTube reviewers, which showed the reviewers achieving a battery charge time of around 18 minutes in a real-world environment. They believed these provided anecdotal support for the internal factory testing. In relation to ad (b) they said that due to an oversight, the references to ultra-fast charging were omitted from the YouTube film. They said they had now removed the relevant YouTube film from Hyundai channels and worked to ensure that Chelsea FC did the same. They said they had no plans to republish these films in the future. Hyundai accepted that there were a large number of variables which could influence the charge time for an electric vehicle battery, including battery temperature, ambient temperature and the age and condition of the battery, and that actual results for individual drivers may therefore vary. They said that while it was correct to say that their claims were substantiated based on testing conducted with the battery at a temperature of 22 and 25 degrees centigrade, it was wrong to infer that this meant that the ambient temperature must also be 22 or 25 degrees centigrade. They said that the battery temperature was likely to be above the ambient temperature when the car was in use, and by an even greater amount during heavy acceleration or higher speeds. They said a driver using a public charging station was unlikely to have a battery that was 'cold' at ambient temperature because they would have driven the car to get to the charging station and likely have driven their car at higher speeds on a motorway or major arterial road because that was where most ultra-fast chargers were located. Hyundai said that one of the three trim lines for the IONIQ 5 model was available with an Eco Pack option which also included a battery heater, designed to help the battery achieve an optimal temperature for charging. They confirmed that as of 26 April 2022 the battery heater feature became standard for all trim lines.Hyundai believed that the average consumer, particularly one contemplating an electric vehicle purchase, would be aware that \"ultra-fast\" 350 kW charging indicated a higher speed charger that was different from fast, standard or slow charging. They said consumers would be aware that not all charging units were ultra-fast/350 kW and therefore that it would be necessary to travel to access the \"ultra-fast\" charging infrastructure. They said drivers would typically charge the batteries of their electric vehicles at home, as referred to in ad (c) and the primary occasion when drivers might require ultra-fast charging was likely to be when they were in transit on longer journeys, due to them not wanting to spend significant time at service stations waiting for the battery to charge, before resuming their journey. Hyundai said that ultra-fast chargers were already available across most of the UK on motorways and major arterial roads, which they believed was where customers needed them. They said the Charge myHyundai website showed 37 ultra-fast 350 kW charging locations in the UK and six ultra-fast 350 kW charging locations in the Republic of Ireland at the time of the ad.Hyundai said that, at the time, a fully charged IONIQ5 would provide between 238 and 298 miles of range depending on the battery size. They said ultra-fast charging was far less likely to be needed by drivers embarking on short journeys in urban or extra-urban locations and that it would be more convenient and cheaper for those drivers to charge at home, at work or with other less powerfulpublic chargers. They said the context for ultra-fast charging was made in ad (c) where the claim was set alongside copy which specifically referred to travelling further afield and the growing number of high voltage networks; and contrasted ultra-fast charging with fast charging at a 50 kW DC station. Hyundai said they were confident that the average consumer would not be misled by charging claims which related to the use of ultra-fast/350 kW charging infrastructure. They said they would be willing to amend the claims that were subject to the complaint to make clear that charging time could vary from 18 to 36 minutes and was dependent on being connected to an ultra fast 350 kW charger. They would also qualify the claim to state that charging times would increase at lower battery temperatures, and that charge times were dependant on a number of factors including battery temperature, condition and age, ambient temperature and the power provided by the charger. They also proposed to include text informing consumers that ultra-fast 350 kW chargers were currently available on selected motorways/major arterial routes, excluding Northern Ireland." ;

The poster was seen in Bristol in June 2022. It featured in large text “BRISTOL is READY for Cleaner Energy” and included Shell’s logo. The TV and YouTube ads, also seen in June 2022, depicted some of Shell’s business activities in 2022 and focused on more environmentally friendly energy products.
Adfree Cities challenged whether the ads were misleading.
By ruling of June 7, 2023, the Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) upheld that complaint.
Consumers were increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of activities related to higher-carbon products and services, and would be interested in seeking out businesses, including oil and gas companies, that were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services. However, they were unlikely to be aware of the details of this in relation to specific companies, and ads were therefore likely to mislead consumers if they misrepresented the contribution that lower-carbon initiatives played, or would play in the near future, as part of the overall balance of a company's activities.
In the absence of qualifying information, the cumulative effect of the ads was to give the impression that low-carbon energy products comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Shell invested in and sold in the UK in 2022, or were likely to do so in the near future.
Shell said they were taking steps towards net zero and promoting sustainable energy. However, according to Shell’s 2021 Sustainability Report, its operations gave rise to greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 that were estimated as equivalent to 1,375 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Large-scale oil and gas investment and extraction comprised the vast majority of the company’s business model in 2022 and would continue to do so in the near future. Because the ads gave the overall impression that a significant proportion of Shell’s business comprised lower-carbon energy products, further information about the proportion of Shell’s overall business model that comprised lower-carbon energy products was material information that should have been included. Because the ads did not include such information, they omitted material information and were likely to mislead.
The ASA ruled that the ads must not appear again in the form complained of. The ASA told Shell to ensure their future ads featuring environmental claims did not mislead by exaggerating or, omitting material information about, the proportion of their business activities that were comprised of lower carbon activities.
A related complaint, concerning the use by UK households of renewable electricity from Shell, was not upheld.""" ;

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but questioning different carbon credit projects. The Ribeirinho REDD+ Project (Project 2620), which is the subject of the lawsuit, overlaps the areas of five State Agro-Extractivist Settlement Projects (PEAEX). These PEAEX are public lands, whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 2620 was presented to an international certifying company in 2017, but has not yet been registered, to generate REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and an increase in forest carbon stocks) for a period of thirty years. The companies and association are being sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of the rural properties where it is located. The DPE-PA alleges irregularities in the property registrations that make up the project, and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. In addition, the mayor of Portel issued a Public Utility Decree authorising its operation, which the DPE-PA argues is unconstitutional. It is emphasised that no prior technical study was carried out for the project. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and public forest concessions and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. It argues that the defendants' behaviour entails the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) suspension of Project 2620 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 2620 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel." ;

The website for Easigrass www.easigrass.com, seen on 5 October 2023, featured a product webpage for “Kensington Eco 38mm” artificial grass. At the top of the page, a box contained a tick next to text that stated “Eco friendly”. Further text on the webpage stated “Fully recyclable”, and an image of the artificial grass was accompanied by a recycling logo labelled with the text “fully recyclable”. A second webpage titled “How to upcycle artificial lawn offcuts” included a text box that stated “recycling”. The webpage featured the text “While installing a synthetic lawn is a great alternative to natural grass, many still question its environmental impact.

Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim that Kensington Eco-Grass was “fully recyclable” to mean that the entire product was easily recyclable once it had reached the end of its life cycle. We considered that consumers would expect that recycling process to be widely available and easily accessible to UK consumers. We understood the composition of their product was different to that of traditional artificial grass products. A new method of binding pile fibres to the backing of the grass was used, which did not necessitate the use of non-recyclable latex or a polyurethane (PU) coating, which were typically used in the production of artificial grass. In their place, we understood that a recyclable coating was applied to the backing. However, we were not provided with further information about that coating, its recyclable properties or the way in which it would be recycled as part of the product at a recycling plant. As such, we considered that we were not provided with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the artificial grass was fully recyclable. In any case, we understood that the product could only be fully recycled at specialist recycling centres, and at the time the ad was seen, there were only three such locations in mainland Europe, and only one location in the UK. We therefore understood that it would not be possible for UK consumers to easily recycle the artificial grass at local recycling centres. Also, as there was only one centre in the UK which could recycle the materials used in the Kensington Eco artificial grass, we considered that access to recycling facilities for their product were not readily available to consumers. As we were not provided with sufficient evidence of the recyclable nature of the coating, and because of the lack of existing UK infrastructure to process the product, we concluded the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached the CAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 11.1 and 11.4 (Environmental claims). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear and that unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information. It required that absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. It also said that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise. We considered that the inclusion of “Eco” within the name of the product, as seen in both ads, implied that the artificial grass was “eco-friendly”. The claims “ticks all the environmental boxes” and “offers a range of environmental benefits” in ad (b) were used on a webpage related to the use of artificial grass offcuts. We considered that these would be interpreted by consumers to mean that the use of artificial grass would positively impact the environment in several ways, and reinforced the understanding that the product was “eco-friendly”. We noted that the ads did not contain any qualifications or further information about the basis of those claims. In the absence of further context or qualification, we considered the direct and implied claims that the product was “eco-friendly” would be understood to mean that the advertised product was not harmful to the environment at any point during its full life cycle. We therefore expected to see a high level of substantiation demonstrating that absolute claim. We understood that Easigrass had included the term “eco” within the product name because the grass could be recycled fully at specific recycling centres, unlike traditional artificial grass products. However, as stated above, we understood that only one recycling centre offered that service in the UK, and therefore, recycling the product would likely not be possible for many UK-based consumers. In addition, we understood that the Kensington Eco artificial grass was made from plastic. We considered that, even if it was recycled at the end of its life cycle, the extraction of raw materials and subsequent processing in order to produce the artificial grass had a negative impact on the environment. We understood that the claims “offers a range of environmental benefits” and “ticks all the environmental boxes” referred to a reduction in the use of water and pesticides when replacing real grass with artificial grass, because artificial grass did not need to be watered, nor did it require upkeep with chemical-based products, such as pesticides. We considered that did not demonstrate that the artificial grass had a positive impact on the environment across its full life cycle. Furthermore, we considered that in those circumstances, the product would be used to replace real grass, thereby having a detrimental impact on biodiversity. We acknowledged that Easigrass said they would remove the claims and amend the product name. However, because at the time the ad was seen we considered that consumers would understand that the Kensington Eco.artificial grass was eco-friendly. We had not, however, seen evidence of that regarding the full life cycle of the product and therefore concluded the claims were misleading. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation ), 11.1, 11.3, 11.4 (Environmental claims)." ;

Easigrass said their Kensington ECO range of artificial grass had an alternative backing, which enabled the product to be completely recyclable. They said they worked with three recycling centres in Germany, Amsterdam and Denmark that offered mechanical recycling, and that process enabled them to reuse polymer materials. For contractual reasons, however, they were unable to provide further details of the full recycling process. They also said that there was a recycling centre in Scotland, where UK-based consumers could recycle ‘Kensington Eco Grass’ independently. They intended to be able to offer a recycling service to all customers in the future, either by running an in-house recycling facility, or to have an agreement in place with the main recycling centre in the UK. However, they explained that, in line with the product’s warranty, they didn’t expect consumers would need to recycle the product until 2033, and by that time, the recycling service would be in place. 2. Easigrass explained that, because the Kensington ECO Range could be fully recycled, the product was more environmentally friendly than other traditional artificial grasses that couldn’t be recycled.

The voiceover stated, “I care about climate change and I love my food. So new Quorn Thai Wondergrains is a step in the right direction because it helps us reduce our carbon footprint and that’s got to be good.” The ad then showed a number of other employees in the office eating the product. A further voiceover stated, “If you care about climate change, take a step in the right direction with new Quorn Wondergrains. Find us in the lunch pots aisle.” On-screen text stated, “Quorn Wonder Grains. Awarded Carbon Reduction Footprint certification by the Carbon Trust for the full life cycle of the product.

Unqualified claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. Comparative claims could be justified if the basis of the comparison was clear. The ASA considered that viewers would understand from the ad that purchasing a Thai Wondergrains pot would contribute to reducing their carbon footprint and therefore have a positive impact on climate change. The ad did not clarify the claim “helps us reduce our carbon footprint”, and we considered that the basis of the reduction was likely to be material information which consumers would need in order to make an informed decision. We noted that the ad included on-screen text, which stated that Wonder Grains had been awarded the Carbon Reduction Footprint certification, and that it related to the full life cycle of the product. However, it did not clarify what the claimed reduction of the carbon footprint was being measured against, and viewers would therefore not know what the basis of the reduction was. We understood that the certification related to the fact that Quorn had measured the carbon footprint of the product and committed to continue to reduce its footprint, meaning that over time, if individuals continued to consume the product, and all other things remained equal, they would reduce their footprint. However, we considered that was not clear from the ad, and viewers would interpret the claim as a comparison against one or more other, similar, products, such that by choosing to buy a Quorn Thai Wondergrains pot over a different product, consumers could reduce their carbon footprint immediately. In addition, we noted that, because the Thai Wondergrains pot was a new product, it was not possible to demonstrate a reduction in its footprint, and the certification for that product related only to Quorn’s commitment to reduce the footprint over time. We did not consider that was clear from the ad. We understood that the award of the certificate, and the reduction of the product’s own carbon footprint over time, was also the basis for the climate change claims, and we considered that was also not clear. Because the ad did not make clear the basis of the claims, i.e. that Quorn had committed to reducing the footprint of their products over time, we concluded that it was likely to mislead. The ad breached BCAP Code rules3.13.1Advertisements must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.93.9Broadcasters must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that the audience is likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation), and9.29.2The basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.and9.49.4Absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation.

They pointed to the on-screen text, which stated that the product had been awarded the Carbon Reduction Footprint certification, with a reference to a page on their website where viewers could go for further information. They said that, because Quorn Thai Wonder Grains was a new product, they did not have a recertification figure for it yet, but by signing up to the carbon footprint protocol they had a continued commitment to reduce the carbon emission on the product. Therefore, they would, over time, be helping viewers reduce their carbon footprint.

We considered the statement “biggest influx of Irish since London in the 1980s” would be understood by most listeners as a reference to the increased emigration of people from Ireland to London during the 1980s, a well-documented socio-economic event in recent history, driven in part by the economic climate in Ireland at that time. We considered that listeners would also understand that this statement was also intended to be a comedic reference to the rivalry between British and Irish trainers and their supporters, their attendance at Cheltenham and the popularity of the event in the UK and Ireland. We acknowledged that immigration could be a sensitive and controversial topic and that some listeners might find that basing humour on the issue of immigration or making light of Irish emigration in the 1980s to be distasteful. However, we considered that the ad was not making negative or disparaging comments about immigration, emigration or the Irish, and concluded that, in the context of the ad, the statement “biggest influx of Irish since London in the 1980s” was unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence. We considered that the statement “So as the British trainers aim to put the Irish trainers back in their little green horse boxes” was also likely to be interpreted as a light-hearted reference to the sporting rivalry between the respective trainers. We therefore concluded it was unlikely to be seen as derogatory towards the Irish population in general. We noted there were no direct references to the IRA in the ad, and in light of the general understanding that the ad was making reference to emigration and sporting rivalries, did not consider that listeners would interpret the ad to be making reference to IRA activities in the UK during that period. We therefore concluded the ad was unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence. We investigated the ad under BCAP Code rules4.24.2Advertisements must not cause serious or widespread offence against generally accepted moral, social or cultural standards.Particular care must be taken to avoid causing offence on the grounds of: age; disability; gender; gender reassignment; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity; race; religion or belief; sex; and sexual orientation.and4.84.8Advertisements must not condone or encourage harmful discriminatory behaviour or treatment.

They said it was widely known and understood by the public that the Cheltenham Festival represented an annual challenge between Great Britain and Ireland for the largest number of winners. They said the ad made light-hearted and humorous references to this well-known rivalry. They said the statement the “biggest influx of Irish since London in the 1980s” was a reference to the commonly known increase in Irish migration to England during that period. They said the statement was a playful metaphor for the large number of Irish fans returning to Cheltenham following the event’s closure to the public due to the Covid-19 pandemic. They said the Cheltenham festival was usually timed to coincide with St Patrick’s Day and was known for its strong attendance of Irish racegoers. They said the ad made no reference at all to the IRA, either overt or implied. They believed that any reasonably well-informed listener would understand the reference in the context in which it was intended, and it could not reasonably be considered derogatory. They said the reference to “little green horse boxes” in the ad was a direct reference to the actual horseboxes commonly used by Irish race trainers. They stated that Willie Mullins, Cheltenham’s most successful trainer, was well known for his use of a fleet of green horse boxes. They said the colour green was synonymous with Ireland and was used to represent Ireland globally. They rejected any suggestion that the use of the word green in the context of Irish horse boxes was derogatory. Therefore, they did not believe the ad could cause serious or widespread offence to the reasonably well-informed customer. Radiocentre said they understood the statement in the ad to be a reference to Irish emigration in the 1980s because of the recession, rather than an IRA reference. They stated the advertiser was an Irish company and the ad was alluding to the fact that Irish horses, trainers and riders won most of the races at Cheltenham." ;

Although the ad did not refer to “Covid-19” specifically, we considered that references to “Coronavirus” would be understood as references to Covid-19. We therefore considered that consumers would interpret the claims “Proven to destroy Coronavirus* cells”, and “*Go-Vi’s Eradicator19+** air purification system has been tested by independent laboratories and proved to be effective against the following: H5N1 & Coronavirus”, to mean that the Go-Vi Eradicator19 could remove the Covid-19 virus from the air and therefore help protect against infection. The product was designed to draw in air from the atmosphere and use UVC light and ozone to clean it, before releasing it back out into the room. We understood that ozone was an approved active substance under the Biocidal Product Regulation. We sought advice from the Health & Safety Executive. The product contained an active substance with the intention of destroying a harmful organism by means other than mere physical or mechanical action. We therefore understood it was likely to be classified as a biocide. We referred to Guidance on the “Potential application of Air Cleaning devices and personal decontamination to manage transmission of COVID-19”, published by the Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) in November 2020. We understood that the effectiveness of air cleaning devices depended on multiple parameters including the underlying technology, the design of the device, the in-room location of the device, the environment in which it was used and the maintenance of the device. The performance of most devices was based on data measured in idealised controlled environments, and was likely to be different and often lower in a real-world setting. The guidance stated that air cleaning devices had limited benefit in spaces that were already adequately ventilated and discouraged the use of air purifiers unless there was strong evidence of their efficacy. We also referred to the Efficacy Guidance provided by the European Chemicals Agency for Biocidal products, which outlined various forms of data that might be expected to determine the efficacy of a product, including simulation tests and field tests, which required comparisons with untreated control samples and an environment representative of real life conditions of use. In order to substantiate the efficacy claims, we therefore expected to see methodologically-sound evidence that reflected how the product was likely to be used in real life. We noted that in principle UVC light at a wavelength around 254 nm was effective against Sars-Cov-2; testing, however, would still need to account for how the product would be used in situ. We considered the evidence provided by Go-Vi Ltd. We understood that at the time, Covid-19 virus samples could not be used for lab testing, and that manufacturers were using other coronaviruses as a substitute to test the efficacy of their products. One document described testing of the product against coronavirus strain OC43, one of the viruses which caused the common cold. The virus was put on glass carriers and placed at a 12-inch distance from the air purifier. The results showed that the virus was removed at a 99%+ efficacy rate in 0.25 of a second to one second. However, the test design did not account for how the product was likely to be used in a real-world setting, particularly considering that the ad indicated that it could be used to remove virus particles from air circulating in a room, as well as disinfecting surfaces. It did not consider the conditions of realistic use, such as the amount of airflow depending on the type of space where the air purifier was placed, the variable settings likely to be applied to the air purifier, the type of the space where the air was being disinfected, or relevant soiling and interfering substances. Test results provided by the supplier of the product stated that the product had removed 99.9998% of the H5N1 avian influenza virus in less than 44 seconds. However, there was no further information provided about the methodology of testing. A press release stated that UV light technology made by the manufacturer had shown a greater than 99.999% reduction of the Sars-Cov-2 virus after less than one second. However, it was unclear if the testing related to the product being advertised, and no details of the study were provided. Go-Vi Ltd did not provide any other evidence to demonstrate how the product provided any benefits in addition to the use of stand air filtering or a normal cleaning regime, for example by testing the ventilation capacity of the product without the addition of UVC light or ozone. Although the active substance used in the product had been approved, we considered that the testing methodology we had seen was not adequate evidence that the product could destroy viruses on surfaces and in the air, thus decreasing the risk of transmission in a real-world setting. We therefore concluded that the ad was misleading and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading Advertising) and3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

Further text stated, “Selected Svalbard cruises with free flights […] Since 1896, we’ve been the leaders in sustainable expeditions”." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "Upheld The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear, and that absolute environmental claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. Environmental claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise. The ad featured the claim “Since 1896, we’ve been the leaders in sustainable expeditions”. The ASA acknowledged HX’s comments that consumers would understand the claim as referring to the sea travel aspect of a trip only. However, the claim was not qualified with that information. Svalbard was an archipelago to the north of Norway, and we understood it would be necessary, in most cases, for consumers to fly to the starting point of a cruise in the area. We considered that consumers would therefore interpret the term “expeditions” as meaning the holiday packages offered from Svalbard were likely to include a flight, irrespective of the time-limited free flight offer.We considered “sustainable expeditions” was an absolute claim, which would be understood as referring to the full life cycle of a HX holiday, including travel to and from the destination location. While we acknowledged HX had taken steps to reduce the environmental impact of its cruises, those steps did not cover all aspects of their holiday packages, and were not referred to in the ad. For example, air travel, such as that required to take a HX cruise, produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. In addition, the measures in place were insufficient to support an absolute “sustainable” claim in relation to the cruise aspect of the holiday. We considered the measures taken by HX did not relate to the claim, and that because they had not taken the aforementioned emissions into account, the absolute claim “sustainable expeditions” had not been adequately substantiated. Because the basis of the claim had not been made clear and we had not seen evidence based on the full life cycle of the product to support the absolute claim “sustainable expeditions” as it would be understood by consumers, we concluded the ad had misleadingly minimised the impact of HX’s holidays and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 11.1, 11.3, and 11.4 (Environmental claims)." ;

The word “expedition” had much stronger associations with travel by land or sea, and in the context of an ad for an expedition cruise company would have been interpreted as referring to the cruise component of the trip. They said the use of an image of a cruise ship in the ad, along with the text “SAIL THIS SUMMER”, “Selected Svalbard Cruises” and “comfortable, purpose-built ships”, made it clear the ad was for a cruise company. Additionally, it was clear the free flight was included as a time limited offer. That being the case, the claim would be understood as meaning Hurtigruten’s expedition cruises, excluding flights, were sustainable. They explained the claim “sustainable” did not mean the cruises had no environmental impact whatsoever; moreover, that their environmental impact was relatively low in the context of other cruise lines.HX explained that they prioritised environmental responsibility and conservation in their expedition operations. They said they were leaders in sustainable expeditions in the expedition cruise sector – launching the world’s first hybrid electric cruise ship, being the first expedition cruise company to banish polluting heavy fuel oil from their fleet and the first to ban single use plastic. They were the only cruise company to produce a rigorous annual Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) report, and they were the only cruise company to be awarded a “Low” ESG Risk Rating. Their 2023 ESG report showed that since 2022 they had reduced their Scope 1 emissions by 18%, per-passenger waste by more than 30% and edible food waste by 22%. HX said they aimed to make a minimal impact on nature, for example, by using quiet ships to preserve the serene environments they traversed. They also donated cruise nights for scientific researchers, to support projects that included underwater drone surveys of fish spawning grounds, penguin colony monitoring and studying humpback whale behaviour and genetics." ;

The plaintiffs ask the court to suspend and cancel the environmental permitting process for the Guaíba Mina Project, led by Copelmi, considered the largest open-pit coal project in the country. The authors claim that there is non-compliance with legal norms and omissions in the Environmental Impact Study (EIA), as well as the absence of prior, free and informed consultation with the indigenous people of the Poty Guarani Indigenous Association, especially the Aldeia (TeKoá) Guajayvi of the MByá Guarani people, located in Charqueadas/RS, less than 3 kilometers from the project site. When the case was filed, the project was in the preliminary permitting phase with FEPAM. According to the Consultation Notices referring to the environmental impact assessment, four public hearings were held. After the first two hearings, the period for sending public comments related to the project began. The authors allege that Aldeia Guajayvi submitted a request to submit comments, but was not heard. The plaintiffs therefore intend to prevent the development of the environmental permitting procedure while there is no proper assessment of the technical and locational feasibility of the project, including considering the State Policy on Climate Change (State Law 13,594/2010)." ;

A voiceover stated, “At Persil, we know that change doesn’t just happen in the comments section”, as the ad showed a woman writing “#plantmoretrees”, and scrolling through social media and clicking “Sad”. It then featured children collecting plastic litter from rivers and ocean waves on a beach, followed by a shot of muddy hands and a boy in a boat wiping his hands on his t-shirt. The voiceover stated, “For real change, we all need to roll up our sleeves and get dirty.” The voiceover then stated, “That’s why Persil deeply penetrates the fibres of clothes to remove tough stains the first time, even in a quick or cold wash and our bottles are made with recycled plastic.” At the same time, the ad showed close up shots of dirt being washed from fibres and materials, and then clothes moving in a washing machine with on-screen text stating, “REMOVES STAINS AT 30ºC” and “60 minutes quick wash”. A Persil bottle was shown falling into water, followed by a moving conveyor belt filled with crushed plastic pieces, during which on-screen text stated, “MADE WITH 50% RECYCLED PLASTIC” and below in smaller font *Excludes cap & label”, for both shots. The voiceover went on to say, “Tough on stains, kinder to our planet. Dirt is good” while it showed children in sunlit outdoor scenes running through white sheets hanging to dry and then a field with trees, also with on-screen text stating, “TOUGH ON STAINS, KINDER TO OUR PLANET”.

It also required that absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation, but that claims such as “greener” or \"friendlier\" could be justified if the advertised product provided a total environmental benefit over that of the advertiser’s previous product or competitor products, and the basis of the comparison was clear. The Code also said that environmental claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise, and claims that were based on only part of an advertised product’s life cycle must not mislead consumers about the product’s total environmental impact. The ASA considered that the statement “kinder to our planet” was an environmental claim that was comparative. We acknowledged that the ad highlighted the liquid detergent products were effective at removing stains in “cold” washes at 30oC in “quick” 60-minute cycles, with bottles that were comprised of 50% recycled plastic. However, we considered the basis of the comparative claim “kinder” was likely to be ambiguous to viewers. The ad did not state or explain the basis of the comparative claim, such as whether the advertised liquid detergents were “kinder” in comparison to Persil’s own previous products or other products. While the ad highlighted the benefits of the detergents - being effective in cold and quick cycles, and the use of recycled plastic - it was not clear if those were new or recent developments, and whether they were specific to the advertised detergents or applied more widely to Persil’s range of products. One of the featured products was also labelled as ‘new’, but not the remaining two. Furthermore, the ad featured various strands of messaging about Persil’s wider environmental initiatives including encouraging people to personally take action to care for the environment, and showing children collecting plastic litter, in conjunction with the statement “Dirt is Good”. In the context of the entire ad with several messages relating to environmental issues, we considered the meaning and basis of the claim “kinder to our planet” was unclear. In addition to the requirement to make clear the basis of environmental claims, we would also require evidence that such claims were based on the full cycle of the advertised product. Although we acknowledged Persil were undertaking actions to reduce the environmental impact of their products, we had not seen evidence or analysis to demonstrate the overall environmental impact of the featured liquid detergents over their full life cycles, compared with Persil’s own previous products or other products, in support of the claim “kinder to our planet”. We concluded that the basis of the claim “kinder to our planet” had not been made clear. Additionally, in the absence of evidence demonstrating that the full life cycle of the product had a lesser environmental impact compared to a previous formulation, we concluded the ad was likely to mislead. The ad breached BCAP Code3.13.1Advertisements must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.93.9Broadcasters must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that the audience is likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation),9.29.2The basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.9.49.4Absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. Comparative claims such as \"greener\" or \"friendlier\" can be justified, for example, if the advertised product or service provides a total environmental benefit over that of the advertiser's previous product or service or competitor products or services and the basis of the comparison is clear.and9.59.5Environmental claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product or service, unless the advertisement states otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle.

They said the ad focused on two specific features of their liquid detergents that made them kinder. Firstly, they were now proven to remove tough stains in a cold and quick wash first time, with no need to re-wash. Persil said they had conducted full stain removal testing on a variety of stains, materials and in different wash conditions for the products featured in the ad, including at 30°C in a 60-minute wash cycle. They stated it was well documented that reducing temperature reduced carbon emissions, and highlighted a news article by Which? reporting that washing clothes at 30°C rather than at 40°C used 38% less energy. They said the ad helped to promote washing at lower temperatures to consumers. Secondly, Persil said that their plastic bottles now contained at least 50% post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR), reducing their use of virgin plastic and carbon derived from fossil fuels in packaging. They said using recycled plastic ensured bottles were kept in a circular plastic economy and out of landfill. The recycled high density polyethylene (HDPE) that the bottles were made of had a lower carbon dioxide equivalent per kg of resin compared with virgin HDPE plastic. Persil said the initiatives were part of a wider Clean Future programme by Unilever, launched in 2020, which aimed to eliminate fossil fuels and ensure net zero carbon emissions in cleaning products by 2030. As part of that their liquid detergents were formulated with lower dose volumes and higher concentrations, and dosing balls had been removed, which had significantly reduced their use of plastic. They also said the opening scenes in the ad showing children collecting plastic waste were a visual reference to Unilever’s ‘Dirt is Good’ project, aiming to engage and inspire children aged 6-13 years to consider climate issues and care for the environment, which included a school’s programme. Persil said the ad therefore demonstrated how their liquid detergents were “Kinder to our planet” by saving energy through cleaning at lower temperatures and in quick washes and using 50% recycled plastic, and did not breach the Code. Clearcast said the three products in the ad had been proven effective at removing a range of different stains in a cold wash at 30°C, and it was indisputable that washing clothes at lower temperatures saved energy. They said the products had also been proven effective in a quick wash (60 minutes), which also saved energy. Clearcast said the advertiser was drawing attention to the improvements they had made to enable consumers to reduce their energy bills without compromising the quality of the laundry experience, and taking into consideration the bottles were made with recycled plastic to reduce waste, the basis for why Persil was kinder to the planet was very clear. Clearcast believed the product benefits were set clearly within the context of Persil’s own development in the ad, and therefore the basis for the environmental claim was fully justified." ;

Although BNDESPar, which is publicly owned, follows an Environmental and Social Policy for Operating in Capital Markets, which bans support for companies with a track record of environmental crimes and modern-day slavery, this policy does not include climate criteria. The company also does not report the carbon emissions associated with its investment portfolio and still maintains equity positions in sectors that are among the most carbon-intensive in the Brazilian economy.

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but challenging different carbon credit projects. The Pacajaí project (Project 981), which is the subject of the lawsuit, overlaps with the areas of the Joana Peres II - Dorothy Stang and Joana Peres II - Rio Pacajá State Agro-Extractive Settlement Projects (PEAEX). These PEAEXs are public lands whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 981 generates REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and increased forest carbon stocks), has been certified by an international company and was established in 2008 to obtain carbon credits for forty years. Companies and individuals are sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of rural property. The DPE-PA claims that the land covered by Project 981 is illegal because it is located on public land within the perimeter of the settlements and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. It is emphasised that the project was implemented without a prior technical study. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and public forest concessions and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. It argues that the defendants' behaviour gives rise to the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) suspension of Project 981 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 981 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel." ;

The plaintiffs asked the court to suspend and cancel the environmental permitting process for the Guaíba Mine Project, led by Copelmi, considered the largest open-pit coal project in the country. The project is to be installed in areas inhabited by traditional communities, such as the Z-5 Fishermen's Colony and indigenous territories. It relates to the State Coal Policy and the Carbochemical Pole of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) - created by State Law 15.047/2017—which the plaintiffs claim was instituted without popular consultation. They argue that more public hearings for the project were requested by affected communities, but the requests were ignored. In addition, they point out that there was no prior, free and informed consultation with the fishermen of Colony Z-5, a traditional community. They claim that the Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA/RIMA) for the project has many gaps, since it ignored the area of influence of the Atlantic Forest biome and the rights of the affected communities. They argue the permitting process violated the Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO), the Federal
Constitution and the State Environmental Code of Rio Grande do Sul, and must be declared null as it also contradicts the fight against climate change determined by the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187 / 2009).""" ;

The plaintiff alleges that the exploitation of minerals in the state is being affected by extreme atmospheric phenomena, a situation neglected by the federative entity. It is pointed out that the negligence regarding the climate issue resulted in the flooding of the Downstream Containment Structure (ECJ) dam built by Vale S/A in the Municipality of São Sebastião das Águas Claras after heavy rains, flooding roads in the region, leaving the district without access to water, electricity, transportation, garbage removal and other essential services. The author indicates that the project was not preceded by an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) or due environmental licensing. The plaintiff emphasizes that the company is unable to measure the impacts of a possible dam failure if the ECJ reservoir is overflowing with water and tailings. It is affirmed that it is therefore necessary to review the hydraulic modeling for this type of project through a corrective environmental licensing process. Still regarding Vale S/A, it is required the stoppage of the Apolo Project, since the studies presented in the scope of its environmental licensing processes would not have analyzed the influence of the intensification of extreme climatic events on the operation of the activity. The environmental licensing process for the Serra do Taquaril Mining Complex, managed by Mineração Taquaril S/A, is also to be halted, considering that the effects of climate change on the project have not been assessed. According to the EIA, due to the Complex, sediment containment basins will be built, which, if they break, will directly impact a water intake pipeline, affecting the supply of 70% of the local population. The plaintiff argues that the National Policy on Climate Change and the State Policy for Preventing and Combating Disasters Resulting from Heavy Rainfall should guide environmental licensing in the State of Minas Gerais, in order to include the climate variable in the procedure, following a decision issued by the 9th Federal Court of Porto Alegre, which determined the inclusion of climate guidelines in the Terms of Thermoelectric Power Plants in Rio Grande do Sul State. It is required that the environmental licensing of the Serra do Taquaril Complex and the Apolo Project must be suspended and the corrective licensing of the JTC must be immediately initiated.
In its reply, Vale S/A informed that the Apolo Project was at a preliminary stage, still under analysis by the competent environmental agency, so as not to represent danger to the environment. It informed that ECJ would already be going through a corrective licensing phase before the competent environmental agency, which is why there was no interest in acting by the plaintiff. It defended the existence of an impossible passive joinder of defendants, since there would be no relationship between the defendants or affinity between the requests made against each defendant. Subsequently, the plaintiff requested an amendment to the initial application, in order to exclude Vale S/A from the defendant's position. In August 2022, a partial judgment was rendered that extinguished the claim against Vale S/A. Afterwards, the court dismissed the action, without resolution of the merits, for inadequacy of the chosen path. It was understood that the Citizen Suit is not an appropriate procedural means for the demand sought.""" ;

However, consumers were unable to win or withdraw any real-world money or tangible prizes from such apps, and therefore, they were not gambling products. We further understood that, whilst real-world money was not required to play, there were in-game purchase options available, which enabled consumers to buy in-game currency or additional gameplay features. The ads featured cartoon imagery of slot machine gameplay and images of coins, accompanied by slot machine sound effects. We considered that was similar to the type of gameplay seen in casino-based slot games, in which it was possible to win and withdraw real-world money in either the virtual or real-world casino environment. We therefore considered consumers would understand that using the app was akin to playing on a mobile slot or real-life slot machine, which involved gambling and the potential to win real-world money. The ads also referenced “hitting the jackpot” and referred to the payouts on the app being “EXTREMELY HIGH”. We considered the terms jackpot and payout were associated with gambling and that “hitting the jackpot” would be interpreted by consumers to mean winning the largest amount of money or prize available. Also, consumers would understand “payout” to be synonymous with other associated gambling terminology such as “withdraw” or “cash-out” and that, therefore, the term represented the amount of money they would win. We considered, therefore, consumers would understand that the apps offered an opportunity to gamble and they were able to withdraw any subsequent winnings. We also considered that the references to and imagery of coins, which emulated a prize display on casino-based slot machines, further reinforced the impression that it was possible to win and withdraw real-world money or another tangible prize. Similarly, we considered the names of the apps “Cash Tornado” and “Jackpot Masters” were both associated with prizes that could be won via gambling, and therefore we considered that consumers would understand the apps provided the opportunity to gamble, and should they have acquired any winnings, that it would be possible to withdraw them. However, we understood that “Cash Tornado” and “Jackpot Masters” were social casino apps through which it was not possible to win or withdraw real-world money or tangible prizes. Whilst we acknowledged that the ads both referenced the games as “social slots”, we considered that the average consumer would not be familiar with the term or that it referred to a game that emulated the slot machine experience without the ability to gamble or withdraw one’s winnings. We also acknowledged that the value of coins referenced in the ads was often fantastical, for example, the ability to win trillions of coins. We considered that consumers would likely understand they were not able to withdraw such vast amounts of money. However, they would assume that the amount of coins referred to in the ad would equate to a different value of real-world currency, which we understood was common practice for in-game currency within apps. As such, we did not consider the use of those figures would override the impression that consumers were able to withdraw real-world money. We also acknowledged that the app store listing and Terms of Service stated that players were unable to win real-world money or prizes. However, that was not sufficient to override the impression created by the ad. The decision to click through to the app store from the ad was a transactional decision in relation to downloading the game, and we considered that consumers were not provided with information in the ad itself that was material to that decision. Because we considered the ads gave the impression that the apps were gambling products in which real-world money could be won and withdrawn, when that was not the case, we considered the ads were misleading and concluded the ads breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising)." ;

The petition seeks to block the plants on different environmental grounds, including that their construction began without a required environmental assessment, and that the plants are inconsistent with international climate agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement because they will use fossil fuels. The complaint also relies on Argentina's civil code, Constitution and General Law of the Environment, as well as a number of international human rights treaties.
On November 30 and December 21, 2017, the Federal Court of Campana granted precautionary measures halting the construction and operation of the plants. The Court based its decisions on the General Act of the Environment (Act 25.675), the protection of collective interests (Art. 14 of the Civil and Commercial Code) and the prevention of damages (Art. 1.711 of the Civil and Commercial Code). Climate impacts were not expressly addressed by the Court. These decisions were upheld by the Federal Court of Appeals of San Martin.
After a requirement by Araucaria, on December 22, 2022, the Federal Court of Campana partially modified the precautionary measure allowing the provisional (six months) and partial (two turbines) operation of the power plant Matheu III, under the monitoring of the Municipality of Pilar. The global energy crisis and the rising of energy prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine were some of the grounds alleged.
On June 29, 2023, the Court decided not to renew the partial allowance of operation of the plant Matheu III after receiving a negative report from the Municipality of Pilar due to noise pollution. It is worth mentioning that, according to this order, the company APR Energy has presented a Plan for the abandonment of the plant Matheu II.
On February 05, 2024, the Federal Court of Appeal of San Martín uphold the decision of the Federal Court regarding the operation of the plant Matheu III. Furthermore, it asked APR Energy to submit to the Ministry of the Environment a closing audit and to the water authority a notification of the activity’s cease.""" ;

Further text stated, “Why is Bio Max so special? [...] Bio max is made with 100% renewable & plant-based materials” and “Learn How Bio Max (TM) is made”. Under the heading “FAQ”, further text included, “We’re expecting to make delivery of all pre-orders by February 2022.

Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “Expected delivery date for all pre-orders is February 2022” to mean that it was very likely pre-orders would be delivered in February 2022, barring unforeseen circumstances outside of Bambooi’s control. We acknowledged that the use of the word “pre-order” signalled to consumers that the product was not currently available. However, we considered they would generally expect the word to only be applied to products that were shortly to be released, or whose release, even if scheduled long in advance, was fixed to a specific date. Because of that, we considered that it was unlikely to mitigate the impression given by the main claim. We further considered that consumers would expect the claimed delivery timeframe to take account of any time required for the product's development to be completed and any ongoing disruption. Much of the ad’s copy, including the text “Bio max is made with 100% renewable & plant-based materials”, referred to the product in the present tense, which we considered supported the impression that the product was ready, or very nearly ready for distribution. We considered that the text \"This gives us plenty time [sic] to get Bio Max produced, shipped & delivered to you – given the current global shipping crisis & Brexit induced delays” also reinforced the impression given by the main claim by implying that, after consideration of factors that might cause delays, the advertiser was certain that the timeframe was achievable. For those reasons, we considered that consumers would expect the product to be delivered within the claimed timeframe. We further considered that if there was a significant risk that disruption, due to a supply chain crisis, or issues with the product’s development, would cause delays to the delivery of pre-orders or even cause them to remain unfulfilled, that was material information website visitors required in order to make an informed decision in relation to pre-ordering the product. However, since the qualifying text under the heading “Risks and Challenges” was included on a tab at the bottom of the page that website visitors needed to click on to view, we considered that material information had not been presented clearly or prominently and was insufficient to counter the impression given by the main delivery claim and other claims referenced above. Because the complainants had not received the product by the end of February 2022, and Bambooi had not provided any evidence to substantiate that in general customers who pre-ordered the product between October 2021 and January 2022 received the product by the end of February 2022, we concluded the claim “Expected delivery date for all pre-orders is February 2022” was misleading. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.3.33.3Marketing communications must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information. They must not mislead by hiding material information or presenting it in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner.Material information is information that the consumer needs to make informed decisions in relation to a product. Whether the omission or presentation of material information is likely to mislead the consumer depends on the context, the  medium and, if the medium of the marketing communication is constrained by time or space, the measures that the marketer takes to make that information available to the consumer by other means.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation),3.93.9Marketing communications must state significant limitations and qualifications. Qualifications may clarify but must not contradict the claims that they qualify.and3.103.10Qualifications must be presented clearly.CAP has published Advertising Guidance onMisleading advertising: use of qualifications.(Qualification). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that the basis of environmental claims must be clear and that absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. The claim “100% Plant-Based Materials” appeared in ads (b) and (c). We considered the claim would be understood by consumers as an absolute claim that all the materials used in the product, including the battery and any other electrical components required for charging, were solely derived using plant matter as a raw material. We further considered they would understand that any processing of that plant matter in the product’s manufacture did not involve the introduction of synthetic materials. We considered that the claim “#NoPlastic” in ad (c) would be understood by consumers as a qualification to the claim “100% Plant-Based Materials”, meaning that none of the “plant-based” materials used in the product were plastics of any kind, including plastics derived from renewable biomass, which were often referred to as “bioplastics”. Bambooi had not provided any evidence relating to the composition of the materials in the product. We therefore concluded the claims “100% Plant-Based Materials” and “#NoPlastic” had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. Ad (c) included the claim “100% […] BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS”, visible on the product packaging. We considered consumers would understand that claim as an absolute claim that all of the product’s components were biodegradable at their likely-end-of-life destination. Ad (b) included the claim \"made from […] materials that are both recyclable & biodegradable”. The wording of the claim implied that all of the product’s components were both amenable to biodegradation at a suitable end-of-life destination, and widely recyclable. However, we considered consumers would generally expect recyclable and biodegradable materials to require different means of disposal and would therefore interpret the claim as an absolute claim that all the materials used in the product could either be recycled or were biodegradable in their likely end-of-life destination. We acknowledged that, in their response, Bambooi had referred to a free service by which customers could return their products for in-house composting at the product’s end-of-life. However, Bambooi had not provided evidence to support that they ran such a service, and we understood it would only apply to materials in the product that were biodegradable. Bambooi had also not provided any evidence to support the claims that all the materials used in the product could either be recycled or were biodegradable. Those claims in both ads (b) and ad (c) therefore had not been substantiated. Notwithstanding that, neither ad (b) nor (c) included any information about how to dispose of the product. We considered that information would be important to ensuring the product reached a suitable end-of-life destination in which it could be successfully recycled or biodegraded as claimed. For that reason, we considered that information was material to consumers’ understanding of the basis of the “biodegradable” and “recyclable” claims, individually or in combination. As such, we considered those environmental claims should have been accompanied by information about what they meant for the product’s disposal in order to ensure that their basis was clear. Because Bambooi had not provided us with any evidence to substantiate the claims “100% Plant-Based Materials” and “NoPlastic”, and claims that the product was made entirely from materials that were either recyclable or biodegradable, and the ads also did not include sufficient information about the basis of the recyclable and biodegradable claims, we concluded they were misleading. On that point, ads (b) and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation),3.93.9Marketing communications must state significant limitations and qualifications. Qualifications may clarify but must not contradict the claims that they qualify.(Qualification),11.111.1The basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.11.311.3Absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. Comparative claims such as \"greener\" or \"friendlier\" can be justified, for example, if the advertised product provides a total environmental benefit over that of the marketer's previous product or competitor products and the basis of the comparison is clear.and11.411.4Marketers must base environmental claims on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the marketing communication states otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle. If a general claim cannot be justified, a more limited claim about specific aspects of a product might be justifiable. Marketers must ensure claims that are based on only part of the advertised product's life cycle do not mislead consumers about the product's total environmental impact.(Environmental claims). 3. Upheld The CAP Code stated that absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation, but that claims such as “greener” could be justified if the advertised product or service provided a total environmental benefit over that of the advertiser’s previous product or service or competitor products or services and the basis of the comparison was clear. The Code also stated that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle. If a general claim could not be justified, a more limited claim about specific aspects of a product might be justifiable. We considered that the unqualified “Eco-friendly” claims in ads (b) and (c) would be understood by consumers to mean that, across its entire life cycle, the advertised product would have either no detrimental impact or an overall positive impact on the environment. We further considered that various other claims in ad (b), including “an electric toothbrush that […] protects the planet”, “Made by Nature”, “we can extract its [sugarcane’s] biomass to feed next year’s crops”, as well as “YOUR SOLUTION” underneath a statistic about plastic waste, reinforced that understanding. In relation to ad (c), we considered the impression given by the main claim was reinforced by the hashtag “#HappyPlanet”, and the claim “Brush sustainably, like you never could before” which was visible in the shot of the product’s packaging. We considered the claim “sustainably sourced” could be interpreted in different ways by consumers depending on the context in which it was used. However, in the context of the ad we considered it was likely to be understood as an absolute claim relating to pre-purchase stages of the product’s life cycle, including the sourcing of raw materials, the production of the finished product, and all intermediate stages between. We further considered that this claim was likely to give the impression that those stages of the product’s life cycle, taken as a whole, did not involve a net depletion of non-renewable natural resources, nor a net emission of greenhouse gases or other pollutants. Because the advertiser had not provided us with any evidence to substantiate the claim “Eco-friendly” in ads (b) and (c) or the claim “Sustainably Sourced” in ad (c) as they would be understood by consumers, we concluded they were misleading. On that point, ads (b) and (c) breached CAP Code rules (Edition 12)3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

Bambooi Sustainable Enterprises Ltd t/a Bambooi said that they had initially intended for pre-orders to be delivered between February and March 2022. However, global supply chain issues had caused that timeframe to be unworkable, meaning delivery was delayed until May and June 2022. They added that customers had been notified of delays by email, but also stated that a significant proportion of customers did not receive any updates because they had not provided an active email address at checkout. They added that a section of their website headed “Risks and Challenges”, which was displayed pre-purchase, outlined the possibility of delays to pre-orders, and also warned website visitors that their pre-order would not be fulfilled if the product’s development was unsuccessful. 2. They stated that every material used in the product was plant-based and referred to a certification they held in support of that. However, they said they could not provide a copy of the certification without the approval of their third-party manufacturer, nor did they provide a list of the materials used in the product or any further information about the product’s manufacturing process. They said that the basis of their \"biodegradable” claims was that the product was 100% commercially compostable and explained that they offered a free service by which customers could return their products for in-house composting after use. However, they did not provide any evidence to demonstrate that was the case. In relation to the “#NoPlastic” claim, they stated that they had never intended to imply that the product was plastic-free and said that the product contained a bioplastic material. 3. Bambooi said that their “Eco-friendly” claim was intended to convey that the product was a more environmentally friendly alternative to other electric toothbrushes on the market. They understood that was case because they believed the product was manufactured in an environmentally friendly way with plant-based materials. They emphasised that their aim in the product’s design had been to minimise its environmental impact and felt that their progress in doing so remained largely unmatched by other electric toothbrush manufacturers. They believed that the “Sustainably Sourced” claim was justified on the basis that they ensured every raw material used in their product came from suppliers closely situated to their manufacturing site. They did not specify which bioplastic was used in the product but said that its production required less oxygen and water than its conventional plastic equivalent." ;

Hearing the case on appeal, the Superior Court of Justice determined that burning should be permitted only in exceptional circumstances, and that sugar refining in general must be less polluting, even if that means being more capital-intensive. In arriving at its decision, the Court acknowledged the appellants' argument that burning cane does not add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere on a net basis over a multi-year timeframe, because it only releases gases absorbed by the cane over the prior 12-18 months. The Court pointed out, however, that burning released in less than an hour greenhouse gases that were absorbed over the course of a year or more." ;

                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "Upheld The ad featured the claim, “Be environmentally … friendly. Take a TIER”. We considered the claim “be environmentally friendly” was an absolute claim and would be understood to mean that the TIER electric scooter caused no environmental damage over the full lifecycle of the scheme, rather than that it had lower carbon emissions than the comparator vehicles. We noted that the ad appeared in an Underground Tube station and stated “changemobilityforgood”. We acknowledged TIER’s argument that the claim was an implicitly relative claim. However, we considered that it was not presented as a clear comparison with any other modes of transport as it showed only an image of an electric scooter and did not refer to any other transport options. We also considered that the claim was not expressed in a more limited comparative way, such as ‘environmentally friendlier’, neither did it make clear if it was intended to refer to swapping to a TIER scooter from another form of transport and if so, what that was. We considered both lifecycle assessment papers (LCA) provided by TIER, which assessed the environmental impact of the operation of shared electric scooters. We noted the study from Berlin highlighted the global warming impact associated with the use of aluminium parts in the production of the electric scooters. We noted from the TIER Mobility LCA, that the electric scooter was manufactured in China and was transported to Europe via container ship, truck, rail and airplane, all of which had varying amounts of emission factors. It also highlighted the disproportionately high share of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the use of aluminium in the production phase. Both LCA’s concluded with a number of recommendations to reduce emission impact, energy demand and improve scooter lifetimes. While we acknowledged that TIER had provided analysis of the measures they had implemented to demonstrate the environmental impact of their electric scooter, we considered that the evidence provided did not demonstrate that the TIER E-Scooter scheme caused no environmental damage over its full lifecycle. The CAP Code also required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear. Notwithstanding that, we considered “Be environmentally … friendly. Take a TIER” would be interpreted as an absolute claim, rather than as the intended comparison. There was no information in the ad to clarify on what that comparison was intended to be based. Because we had not seen evidence based on the lifecycle of the product to support the absolute claim “Be environmentally friendly, take a TIER” as it would be understood by consumers, we concluded the ad was misleading and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1The standards objectives, insofar as they relate to advertising, include:a) that persons under the age of 18 are protected;b) that material likely to encourage or incite the commission of crime or lead to disorder is not included in television and radio services;c) that the proper degree of responsibility is exercised with respect to the content of programmes which are religious programmes;d) that generally accepted standards are applied to the contents of television and radio services so as to provide adequate protection for members of the public from inclusion in such services of offensive and harmful material;e) that the inclusion of advertising which may be misleading, harmful or offensive in television and radio services is prevented;f) that the international obligations of the United Kingdom with respect to advertising included in television and radio services are complied with [in particular in respect of television those obligations set out in Articles 3b, 3e,10, 14, 15, 19, 20 and 22 of Directive 89/552/EEC (the Audi Visual Media Services Directive)];g) that there is no use of techniques which exploit the possibility of conveying a message to viewers or listeners, or of otherwise influencing their minds, without their being aware, or fully aware, of what has occurred\"Section 319(2).and3.73.7Advertisements must not falsely imply that the advertiser is acting as a consumer or for purposes outside its trade, business, craft or profession.

They said they were addressing people who had a selection of mainstream transport options, such as petrol cars or non-electric buses, with the conclusion being that ‘taking a TIER’ was an environmentally sound choice as a means of transport. TIER said environmentally friendly could also be seen as a term which described the attributes of a product or service, rather than the product or service in its entirety. TIER said their electric scooter service could be described as environmentally friendly because in their operations they used electric vans and electric cargo bikes for servicing, renewable energy for charging, recycled materials in production and decommissioned scooters were recycled. TIER provided documentation that their production facilities were certified to minimise environmental risks. TIER provided a report from the International Transport Forum (ITF) which they said examined and compared the energy and climate impact across different modes of transport and was a recognised international reference point for comparing their environmental performance. TIER said that their operational model and scooters had a vehicle lifetime of over five years and the vehicles they used for servicing were electric vans and electric scooters, which they said significantly lowered their carbon emissions. In contrast, TIER said the ITF report estimated a two-year electric scooter lifetime and use of diesel vans for servicing. The ITF report also compared the carbon dioxide emissions of hybrid and electric taxis, combustion engines and electric buses with a shared electric scooter. TIER said their own research showed that on average 17.3% of their rides replaced car journeys and that electric scooters could fare better than buses and metro in their emissions. TIER provided a paper entitled Life Cycle Assessment on the Mobility Service E-Scooter Sharing. It produced results of the lifecycle assessment of shared electric scooters in Berlin, which included the various factors that influenced the greenhouse balance and global warming potential compared to alternative means of transport. Tier also provided a Life Cycle Assessment Mobility study for an electric scooter model which they said was effectively the same as the model they deployed in London. The study aimed to identify the main factors of negative environmental impacts. It analysed the impact of the scooter across the entire lifecycle of the product, manufacture, transport, use phase and disposal. They said they had put in place a range of measures to minimise environmental impact and maximise the sustainability of their service." ;

The ASA considered this was a common and recognisable setting that many viewers, including children, would be familiar with, and accordingly would be easy for them to emulate the specific scene depicted in the ad. Furthermore, because the ad featured two young children in a realistic and familiar environment, who were posing and attempting to answer a question about how their bodies worked, we considered children would identify with them and their curiosity, and be encouraged to emulate the behaviour. Although the ad was specifically for a soft cheese, we considered that younger children would be encouraged by the ad to mimic the behaviour in other settings, and with other foods. Therefore, we considered the ad condoned and encouraged eating whilst hanging upside down. We sought a view from the Child Accident Prevention Trust (CAPT). Their view was that the scenario depicted in the ad represented a situation where there was potentially a high risk of choking. The challenge of breathing, chewing and swallowing safely in an unnatural position was potentially difficult in itself, and the risk was compounded by the further hazard of falling and incurring head and neck injuries.We also noted that one complainant had reported that their three-year-old relative, after seeing the ad, ate their food whilst hanging upside down. We therefore considered that eating whilst upside down was an unsafe practice and one which could be dangerous for children to emulate. We acknowledged that because the ad had an ex-kids restriction, children’s exposure to it would be reduced. However, we considered that the ad condoned and encouraged younger children to eat whilst hanging upside down, which was an unsafe practice where there was potentially a high risk of choking. We therefore concluded that a scheduling restriction was not sufficient to reduce the risk of harm and that the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 4.5 (Harm and offence), 5.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.4 (Children), 30.6, 30.10 and 30.15 (Advertising rules for on-demand services regulated by statute)." ;

The children in the ad were six and eight years of age. The ad included two parents in the background who were supervising the children. Although the children were hanging upside down, they were nearly touching the floor and therefore were at a safe distance so as to not fall and hurt themselves. Based on research they had seen, to which they provided links, the human body was able to move food into the stomach through peristalsis, regardless of gravity. They referred to a study that they said supported their view that a person’s ability to swallow was not affected by the position they ate in, including when eating upside down. They also referred to a letter, published in a journal dedicated to the study of resuscitation, which they said stated that being in a head down position was recommended during a choking incident. Based on the research, and because Dairylea was a soft food, they considered there was a very low risk of choking when eating upside down. They provided information about their approach to placing ads for Dairylea in different media, and highlighted that the VOD ad had been given an ‘ex-kids’ scheduling restriction. That meant that it was scheduled away from programming commissioned for, principally directed at, or likely to appeal to children under 16 years of age. They believed that the ad would therefore have had very limited exposure to children and as such it was unlikely that children would emulate eating when upside down or come to harm. However, they said they were no longer running the ad and would remove references to eating upside down if they used the ad in future. Clearcast endorsed Mondelez’s comments, and also particularly highlighted that they had given the ad an ‘ex-kids’ scheduling restriction which ensured that children’s exposure to it was limited. Additionally, the ad was for a soft food, which, in their opinion, would not have been a choking hazard. ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 said the ad was scheduled on their VOD services in accordance with Clearcasts’ scheduling restrictions." ;

They must not include a person or character whose example was likely to be followed by those aged under 18 years or who had strong appeal to those aged under-18. CAP guidance stated that, of relevance to gambling, football was the most prominent subject of strong appeal to under-18s. It was an activity in which a very significant proportion of under-18s participated directly on a frequent basis, and had a general interest in through following professional teams, and players, across a variety of media. There was also a highly developed infrastructure around organised participation and the sport had an exceptionally high media profile. Those who played at an elite level, especially those who were successful internationally, were therefore likely to appeal strongly to children. The guidance stated that non-UK ‘star’ footballers, particularly those at top European Clubs, were considered high-risk in terms of how likely they were to be of strong appeal to under-18s. We noted that the ad included Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets who were both current players at the European Football Club FC Barcelona and played for the Spanish national team. FC Barcelona was a professional, top-flight football club that competed in Spain’s top league, and were known to be one of the most widely supported and successful clubs in the world. We considered that they would be classed as a ‘top’ European club under CAP guidance. We noted that Jordi Alba had been a player at FC Barcelona since 2012 and had won 16 major honours that included ten Spanish trophies as well as one UEFA Champions League title. At the time the ad appeared, Serqio Busquets had made nearly 700 appearances for FC Barcelona where he was the current captain and ranked third in terms of most appearances in Barcelona’s history. They were also both well-known members of the Spanish National team, with Sergio Busquets being the team’s captain at the time the ad appeared. They had both played for Spain during the most recent 2022 FIFA World Cup which had taken place shortly before the ad had been promoted. They had also been part of the Spanish team at the European championship in 2020, and both played in the Semi-Final against Italy in London at Wembley. Whilst Sergio Busquets had been the captain at both competitions, Jordi Alba had also taken on the role at the European Championship semi-final. Both of those international events had a large amount of media coverage in the UK and were prominent events that would have been of interest to under-18s. We considered that the role of captain for a team, particularly a national team would be likely to make a player more well-known and admired by under-18s. For those reasons we considered that they were ‘star’ players who had a high profile at a top European club and would be considered ‘high-risk’ according to CAP guidance, and therefore were likely to be of strong appeal to under-18s. We considered that it would have been acceptable for the ad to appear in a medium where under-18s, for all intents and purposes, could be entirely excluded from the audience. That would apply in circumstances where those who saw the ad had been robustly age-verified as being 18 or older, such as through marketing lists that had been validated by payment data or credit checking. Because Facebook was a media environment where users self-verified on customer sign-up, and did not use robust age-verification, we considered that Bet Victor had not excluded under-18s from the audience with the highest level of accuracy required for ads the content of which was likely to appeal strongly to under-18s. For those reasons, we concluded the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) 16.1, 16.3 and 16.3.12 (Gambling)." ;

They noted that CAP guidance stated that when a person or character was used to illustrate a subject of strong appeal to under-18s, their association with the subject was not a basis alone for the ASA to find an ad in breach of the Code. They said that whilst FC Barcelona was a top-flight team, this would not mean that their players were well-known in the UK. They said that they did not consider that Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets fell into the category of ‘high risk’ as defined by CAP guidance, and specifically that they were not well-known star players like Messi, Mbappe, Xavi, Mane, Ronaldo or Benzema. Instead, they considered they fell within the ‘medium risk’ category of footballers with lower profiles at top Euro or World clubs. They said neither played in an attacking or goal-scoring position and that their names did not make headlines. In addition, neither player had ever scored against any UK team and had not played in a club match against any Premier League team since 2019 at the time the ad appeared. They said that whilst both players had played for their country, their latest appearances for Spain had not resulted in any games against England or Wales. They said the last time Spain had played England was in 2018 and Jordi Alba had neither been in the team nor a substitute. They said the Spanish team had won the World Cup in 2010 and the European Cup in 2012, and any under-18s who witnessed those events and who might have formed an attachment to those players, would now be over 18. They said Jordi Alba did not play in the final of the World Cup in 2010 and Sergio Busquets only made his debut first-team appearance for Spain in that tournament. They said neither player had scored an international goal against a British team. They said to further understand the appeal of the Spanish national team to the UK, only six players on the team played in the Premier League. They said their conclusion was that both of those players had lower profiles and were therefore acceptable for inclusion in the post. Bet Victor also said that neither player had a high-value, personal sponsorship deal with any major brand known in the UK, and they did not have a strong social media profile with those aged under-18. They said their preferred social media profile was on Twitter and Instagram rather than Snapchat, Twitch or Tiktok. Sergio Busquets’ last Twitter post was in May 2019 and Jordi Alba’s Twitter page and posts, as well as his Instagram posts, were in either Spanish or Catalan. They said that the demographic of their social media followers for both players was similar, and that the followers from the UK did not feature in the top five countries where their followers were based. They said Search Engine Optimisation data supported that neither footballer had a volume of Google searches in the UK as true ‘top-flight’ footballers and also had less than retired UK footballers. Sergio Busquets’ total UK searches were only 1.9% of Messi’s, 1.33% of Ronaldo’s and 4.46% of Mbappe’s in the week from 16 to 22 January 2023. They said this was similar for Jordi Alba, whose was 1.67% of Messi’s, 1.14% of Ronaldo’s and 3.8% of Mbappe’s. They said in the same time period Busquets’ searches were 15% of Micah Richards’ and 17% of Peter Crouch’s, whilst Alba’s were 13% of Micah Richards’ and 15% of Peter Crouch’s; both being former players who had been the subject of recent ASA Rulings on the subject of strong appeal to under-18s. They said that trend was consistent not only during the week the post was made but also during events such as the World Cup, where they did observe an increase in the UK search volume for the two players in the post. However, they considered that they were still materially lower than for personalities such as those of recently retired footballers and pundits that the ASA considered not to be of ‘strong’ appeal. They said there had not been an increase in search data as a result of the post. Bet Victor said that whilst they understood the post was considered by the ASA as an ad because it was paid-for, the post had been designed to engage people in conversation about topics they would be interested in. They said that there were no comments, links or calls to action back to betting sites or logos in the post (other than their own). The said it had only been paid-for to ensure the ad had been appropriately targeted to users aged 25 and over. They said data they had from Facebook showed that 100% of the post’s viewers were over the age of 25." ;

Right now, good things are happening at [business name]”. Underneath that was boxed text that stated, “Lloyds Bank Business” followed by the Lloyds Bank logo. The business’s name appeared in small white writing in the top left-hand corner of the ad. b. The first paid-for LinkedIn post featured an image of grass, wildflowers and butterflies with text that stated, “We’re partnering with Projects for Nature to support nature recovery and engage communities across projects in England”. The text “Projects for Nature” and “engage communities”. At the bottom of the ad was a link labelled “Find out more”. c. The second paid-for LinkedIn post featured the same image as ad (b) and text that stated, “We’re teaming up with Projects for Nature to help protect our natural environment. Our funding will support three projects that include: Creation of a 100-mile natural recovery corridor along three rivers in Sussex, helping boost biodiversity, reduce flooding and enhance the rural economy; Natural flood management in Cumbria, including re-wiggling rivers, planting trees and restoring wetlands; Working with partners and tenant farmers in the Peak District to establish more trees, healthy peatlands, thriving wetlands and grasslands and improve soil health and water quality”. d. The third paid-for LinkedIn post stated, “What are we doing to help accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy? We’re committed to supporting the energy transition, by continuing to […]”. The rest of the caption, which was only viewable when consumers clicked a button labelled “see more” stated “[…] reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and putting the weight of our finance into clean and renewable energy. We use 100% renewable energy to power our buildings; We’re aiming to halve our own energy consumption by 2030; We’re also helping people and businesses across the UK to understand how they can be more sustainable”. A video embedded in the post featured an animation that showed electricity from a power station being used to power business and domestic buildings and an electric vehicle (EV). The EV then drove through agricultural land and a growing woodland. The video then cut to an image of Earth with superimposed text that stated, “Helping Britain Prosper”. The word “Prosper” was coloured green." ;

The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear, and stated that unqualified claims could mislead if significant information was omitted. The ASA first assessed ad (a). We acknowledged Lloyds’ comment that the ad had formed part of a wider campaign that included reference to businesses from a number of industries. Nevertheless, given that ads in such a campaign were likely to be seen in isolation, we assessed the ad as it would have appeared to consumers in situ. The ad appeared on a bus shelter, where it would have been seen by both consumers and potential business consumers. It showed a person handling seaweed and included text that referred to the nature of the featured business – using seaweed to make packaging. It referred to “Growing the business”, which we considered would be interpreted as meaning the company was focused on expansion. In the context of the ad we considered that consumers would understand that Lloyds had financed the development of the featured business and could help other prospective businesses develop and expand theirs. While the ad featured a business which was developing a product that was likely to be seen as having an environmentally beneficial focus, we considered consumers and business consumers would understand it as a case study in how Lloyds supports businesses develop and expand, rather than being an example of Lloyd’s green business financing more generally. It was therefore unlikely to be interpreted as making wider environmental claims about Lloyds’ business practices. We next assessed ads (b) and (c), both of which promoted a partnership between Lloyds and Projects for Nature, a platform that sought private sector funding for nature recovery projects. Ad (b) made a general statement about the partnership, whereas ad (c) detailed specific projects that Lloyds’ donation would go towards. Lloyds’ logo appeared alongside, and in an equal size to, the Project for Nature logo in both ads. We considered consumers and business consumers would understand from the ads that Lloyds had donated to Projects for Nature to support nature recovery projects. They would understand the ads as making a limited claim about Lloyds’ contribution to the platform. While ad (b) did not contain the same level of information as ad (c), we considered consumers would still understand the ad in that context, since the additional text in ad (c) only set out examples of projects to which Lloyds’ funding could be directed. They would therefore not interpret the ads as making wider environmental claims about Lloyds’ business practices. We then assessed ad (d), which detailed steps Lloyds was taking to reduce its carbon footprint, which included reducing their operational (Scope 1) emissions and helping consumers and their business customers become more sustainable. A video in the ad showed an electric car driving through a suburban setting before entering a more rural area with haybales and a forest. A final scene showed Earth with the text “Helping Britain Prosper”, the word “Prosper” was shown in green. Businesses and consumers were likely to have an awareness that many companies were in the process of reducing their operational emissions in response to the climate crisis, and as part of their transition to net zero and contribution to a net zero society. In that context, we considered they would understand from the ad that Lloyds was taking steps to reduce their operational carbon and GHG emissions by using renewable energy and halving energy consumption by 2030. However, the ad also made wider claims about Lloyds’ financing of clean and renewable energy, and contribution towards a low carbon economy, including by helping its customers become more sustainable. Specifically, the ad claimed Lloyds was putting the “weight of [its] finance” into renewable energy. We considered those claims and the imagery in the ad, in the absence of qualifying information, and along with the final scene of the embedded video, gave the general impression that renewable energy formed a significant proportion of Lloyds’ investments and the companies it financed. While we acknowledged Lloyds’ comments that the ad contained some balancing information that it was reducing its reliance on fossil fuels, that claim related to Lloyds’ operational use of fossil fuels rather than that of the companies it financed. We understood Lloyds was taking steps towards net zero and promoting sustainability to its customers. However, according to Lloyds’ 2023 Sustainability Report, their financed emissions in 2022 stood at 32.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which represented a large contribution to GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions. Investment in and financing of areas of climate risk comprised a notable amount of the company’s activities and would continue to do so in the near future. We considered that meant, despite the impression given in ad (d), Lloyds was continuing to significantly finance businesses and industries that emitted notable levels of carbon dioxide and other GHGs. That was material information that was likely to affect consumers’ understanding of the ad’s overall message, and so should have been made clear. We therefore concluded ad (d) omitted material information and was likely to mislead. Ad (d) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 11.1 (Environmental claims). We also investigated ads (a), (b) and (c) under those rules, but did not find them in breach." ;

The featured business had been chosen for their innovation and would be understood by consumers as meaning Lloyds works with growing businesses such as the one shown. They said the ad made no claims in respect of the environmental or social credentials of the business or Lloyds, as they were not the focus of the campaign. Lloyds said the claims in ads (b) and (c) were factually accurate, clear and intelligible. The ads detailed specific nature recovery projects to which Lloyds donated and used imagery relevant to those activities. The ads linked to a press release about the charity partnership. In their view the ads accurately represented the nature of the partnership and did not omit any material information. The content of the ads had been reviewed by both the relevant charity partners, and the UK government departments involved, to ensure accuracy and clarity. Lloyds said claims in ad (d) were factually accurate and substantiable. The ad copy and accompanying animation gave a clear overview of the sectors with which Lloyds was involved, the support they offered clients and customers, and the steps they were taking to make their own operations more sustainable. The ad included balancing information that acknowledged Lloyds’ involvement with carbon intensive industries and stated they were “continuing to reduce [their] reliance on fossil fuels”. The ad linked to webpages detailing their sustainability activity, including a download link to their most recent sustainability report. The ad was prepared for Earth Day 2024, and so included an image of Earth in the closing frame. They explained that the Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) had used the colour green in its palette for many years, which was why the word “Prosper” appeared in green at the end of the ad, in-line with their brand guidelines. Lloyds provided a copy of their 2023 Sustainability Report which showed the LBG had total financed emissions of 33 MtCO2e (million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) in 2022. They had exited UK thermal coal power at the end of 2023, and did not directly finance retrofit activities that prolonged the life of existing thermal coal facilities. They planned to exit from all diversified mining companies that operated thermal coal facilities by 2030. They had set targets to reduce the emissions intensity of their power sector clients by 81%, and to reduce the absolute emissions from their oil and gas clients by 50%, by 2030." ;

Environmental claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise. The ASA welcomed Mazda’s willingness to withdraw the ad and make changes to their campaigns in light of receiving notification of the investigation.The ad featured the claim “The Mazda2 Hybrid combines the power of a petrol engine and the efficiency of a battery-powered electric motor. Exciting, efficient and sustainable”. We acknowledged that Mazda sold a version of the Mazda2 with a petrol engine and without an electric battery engine, and that the electric battery of the Mazda Hybrid would result in lower carbon emissions, when driving, in comparison to the petrol version of the Mazda2. However, that comparison was not referenced. We considered “sustainable” was an absolute claim, and in the context of the ad, was likely to be understood by consumers as referring to the full life cycle of the hybrid Mazda2. We understood that when the Mazda2 Hybrid’s electric battery engine was used no emissions were produced from the tailpipe, but when the car used its petrol engine, greenhouse gases were produced. We also understood other circumstances, such as the manufacturing of the car and charging the battery using electricity from the national grid, generated emissions. Evidence in relation to the entire life cycle of the car, which would include the use of a petrol engine, had not been produced. The absolute claim “sustainable” had therefore not been adequately substantiated.Because the basis of the claim had not been made clear, and we had not seen evidence based on the full life cycle of the car to support the absolute claim “sustainable” as it would be understood by consumers, we concluded the ad had misleadingly minimised the impact of the Mazda2 Hybrid. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 11.1, 11.3, and 11.4 (Environmental claims)." ;

Upheld The CAP Code required that absolute environmental claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. The ASA considered that the claims “Eco-Friendly Aviation”, “Sustainable Aviation” and “Turn Flying Into A Force For Good” read together in the context in which they appeared would be understood by businesses to mean that 4AIR offered services that could ensure aviation operations did not cause environmental damage. While we acknowledged the use of “future” in the “Future of Sustainable Aviation”, which could refer to an aspirational goal, the claim was immediately followed by the text “Learn How To Turn Flying Into A Force For Good” which would be understood by businesses to mean that by using 4AIR’s services their business would be capable of having an immediate positive impact on the environment. We therefore expected to see a high level of evidence that substantiated the claims, taking into account the full life cycle of the products and services associated with 4AIR’s services. While we accepted that 4AIR did not own or operate any aircraft, its services were directly linked with aviation, and we therefore considered the claims in the context of the full life cycle of aviation operations. We acknowledged that Sustainable Aviation Fuel produced lower emissions than traditional aviation fuel. However, we understood that aviation, even with the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, produced high levels of CO2 and non-CO2 emissions which contributed to climate change. We further acknowledged that 4AIR gave businesses the opportunity to support the Aviation Climate Fund’s research into future technologies related to reducing the negative environmental impact of the aviation industry. We understood, however, that the results of that initiative would be delivered decades into the future and therefore concluded that support of it was not adequate substantiation to evidence the claim “Turn Flying Into A Force For Good” as it would be understood in the context of the ad. Furthermore, we understood that at the time the ad appeared, there were no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry which would adequately substantiate absolute claims such as “Eco-friendly Aviation” and “Sustainable Aviation” as we considered businesses would interpret them in the context of the ad. We concluded that the claims were likely to mislead businesses in relation to 4AIR’s capability to ensure that aviation operations which purchased its services did not negatively impact the environment, and the ad therefore breached the Code.

The ad included footage of a sniper character shooting different barrels that were rolling towards the character, each with a different number on it. Roman centurions idly stood on top of some of the barrels. The caption stated, “Navigate obstacles, unleash devastating attacks”. The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the ad that the game mainly featured a puzzle solving element that involved shooting targets, while having to avoid obstacles, such as the rolling barrels. We understood that the ad included one aspect of the gameplay, namely the puzzle solving element. We compared the footage of the ad with the first gameplay video provided by Evony. While not identical, the gameplay and graphics were comparable to those of the ad and provided a similar gaming experience. We also reviewed a second gameplay footage video of another puzzle, which featured the character navigating obstacles to cross through a path, without shooting targets. We therefore understood that the game featured a puzzle similar to that shown in the ad, and that it was one of a number of different puzzles. However, we further understood that Evony was not primarily a puzzle game. It also included player versus player, player versus environment and city-building aspects, with the city-building element being the game’s core gameplay. Although players could choose to play only one of the aspects of the game, such as the puzzles, they were not able to progress through the storyline without engaging with all elements. If players did not level up in the core gameplay, they were eventually locked out of the puzzles. For those reasons we concluded that the ad did not reflect the game’s core playing experience and was therefore misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading advertising)." ;

Players could, if they wanted to, purchase virtual digital enhancements. However, all gameplay was accomplished by the player themselves. To progress through the game, players needed to engage in strategic city-building, tactical player versus player and player versus environment on the world map, and progress through puzzles. The main quest line guided players through the games, which required them to focus on each part of the overall game and rewarded them with more content. “Evony: The King’s Return” offered a varied gaming experience with different elements to the game. The ad in question, which featured a fighter character interacting with numerically marked barrels, was indicative of the game’s puzzle solving aspect which was just as essential as the city-building and strategy to progress in the game. While players were not forced to play any specific part of the game, they would fall behind and not progress without playing all parts. The success of the game was based on the fact that it offered wide ranging freedom to engage with the specific parts of the game that players enjoyed. They said that the ad showcased actual gameplay and mechanics, directly engaging the player in strategic thinking and action. They considered that this was different from previous ASA rulings on misleading gaming ads where there was a mismatch between the ad and the gameplay. The ad represented the interactive and strategic components that players actually experienced in the game across the puzzles. The puzzles were not mere mini-games, and they were designed to be challenging and rewarding, blending with the game’s overall strategy. They provided an electronic copy of the ad and two gameplay videos, to showcase the similarities between them. They considered that players were sophisticated enough to determine quickly if a game was not similar to the ad, and that would result in them abandoning the game soon after installing. This would frustrate their goal of attracting players to the community and against their responsible app advertising initiative. The specific ads had over 80% retention rate from players who had installed after being shown the targeted puzzle ads. Given the game’s breadth and scope, it was difficult to showcase the entire game experience. Because the ads were targeting adults who had interest in puzzle games, they showed them the aspect that was most likely to be interesting to them. They pointed to their “Responsible App Advertising” initiative, which included the goal of ads authentically depicting the game’s content." ;

The lawsuit seeks to order the defendants to adopt effective measures to comply with the guidelines, deadlines and targets set out in federal and Rio Grande do Sul 's climate laws. It is argued that in the period from 2009 to 2023, the Federal Government, and from 2010 to 2023, the state of Rio Grande do Sul, by action or omission, failed to comply with the legal guidelines and did not meet the deadlines and targets set out in the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC), the Paris Agreement and the Rio Grande do Sul ‘s Policy on Climate Change (PGMC), as there was no effective implementation of instruments such as the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), equal and transparent composition of the Rio Grande do Sul Climate Change Forum (FGMC) and the Brazilian Climate Change Forum and no measures have been taken to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from coal-fired power plants in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with a Just Energy Transition (TEJ) plan, which results in the ineffectiveness of these climate standards. It is pointed out that the climate crisis has led to water shortages in the municipality of Candiota, which has been recognized by municipal decree and that, in parallel to this situation, the various coal-fired thermoelectric plants in the region use local water for cooling, causing damage to the water system, the biome and the climate. It is alleged that the defendants have neglected climate policy when dealing with the licensing and renewal of licenses for these projects in the state. At the same time, the Federal Government has encouraged coal-fired thermoelectric projects through energy auctions authorized by ANEEL. CRM, responsible for the Candiota coal mine, and CGT Eletrosul, responsible for the Candiota III Thermoelectric Plant - the most polluting and least efficient plant in the country - have been operating in disregard of environmental climate laws. It is argued that it is up to the Judiciary, based on the principle of the prohibition of regression and duties of protection, to guarantee effective compliance with the rules in question and prevent the climate scenario from worsening. It is argued that the entire situation of alleged unlawfulness gives rise to a claim for compensation for collective moral damages. The plaintiffs make several requests for injunctive relief for the various defendants, so that the defendants' conduct is brought into line with the environmental climate standards. On the merits, it is requested that (i) the requests for preliminary injunctions be confirmed; (ii) it be declared that in the period from 2009 to 2023, the Federal Government, and from 2010 to 2023, the state of Rio Grande do Sul, by action or omission, failed to comply with climate standards and did not meet the deadlines and targets set out in the PNMC, the Paris Agreement and the PGMC, because they did not give effect to the regulations and did not act to reduce GHG emissions from coal-fired thermoelectric plants in the state; (iii) to declare that Rio Grande do Sul has failed to meet the targets and deadlines set out in international, national and state regulations; (iv) the suspension of public incentives to exploit coal in the state, the implementation of a TEJ plan for the contested plants; the publication of public notices to finance educational projects and research projects with universities and federal institutes that encourage environmental awareness and the guidelines of the PNMC and PGM; the creation of a WG for the decommissioning and energy transition of coal-fired projects; the suspension and non-renewal of energy sales contracts for the contested plants; (v) ordering the defendants to pay compensation for climate damage; (vi) ordering the Federal Government and the state of Rio Grande do Sul to bear the costs of the requests made; (vii) ordering all the defendants to pay the sum of ten million reais as collective moral damage in environmental and climate matters." ;

There was no qualification to the claim and although we acknowledged that the ad also stated “YOUR RECIPE TO A HEALTHIER PLANET” and “DELICIOUSLY PLANT BASED”, we considered it was not clear whether those were intended to clarify the claim “GOOD FOR THE PLANET”, or to be read as separate claims. We therefore considered the claim “GOOD FOR THE PLANET” could be interpreted in more than one way. For example, that there would be net positive environmental benefit from producing the three products featured in the ad (soy drink, almond drink and soy alternative to yogurt). Alternatively, that the three products were less detrimental to the environment compared to dairy equivalents across their lifecycles. We considered the ad was ambiguous between those interpretations. The complainant raised concern because they understood that almond production in certain areas of the world could have a negative environmental impact. We understood that the almonds that were used in the production of Alpro’s almond drink were not sourced from those regions. However, the CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear and that unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information. We acknowledged that Alpro had provided analysis in order to demonstrate the environmental impact of two of the three featured products across their lifecycle. We noted that the analysis provided in relation to Alpro’s oat drink did not assess the environmental impact of that product’s entire lifecycle, including, for example transport, packaging and retail. However, because we considered it was not clear what the basis of the claim “GOOD FOR THE PLANET” was, we concluded the ad was misleading and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification) and 11.1 (Environmental claims)." ;

Alpro believed a link was established in the ad between text which stated \"DELICIOUSLY PLANT-BASED\" foods and the claims \"HEALTHIER PLANET\" and \"GOOD FOR THE PLANET\" by expressly referring to the plant-based nature of the Alpro products. Therefore, consuming more plant-based foods in a diet would contribute to a \"healthier planet\" and was \"good for the planet\". Alpro said that how food was grown, sourced and produced, affected the earth, animal life, water, air and therefore the whole climate. They said that shifting towards more plant-based diets was widely recognised as a way to lower the carbon footprint of the agri-food sector. Also, plant-based drinks required substantially less water and land and generated substantially lower CO2 emissions, than cow milk. Alpro referred to several studies which they said showed that soy drink, almond drink, oat drink and rice drink had a lower environmental impact than cow milk. They also provided lifecycle analysis for the soy drink, almond drink and soy alternative to yogurt which were featured in the ad. Alpro said that the almonds they used in their almond drink were cultivated in a sustainable way which minimised water use and protected biodiversity and pollinating insects. They clarified that the almonds they used came exclusively from small farms around the Mediterranean and that they were mostly watered by rain. Alpro said that although almonds needed more water than soy or oat, the impact on land use and greenhouse gas emissions remained very small, and the environmental impact of almond drink was significantly lower than that of cow milk. Alpro said that the more small-scale, traditional cultivation of almonds in the Mediterranean region depended on pollination by wild pollinators (wild bees and other flying insects), which were considered an important and valuable resource for the almond crop. They said that, on occasion, commercial bees were used as an addition to the natural pollination, but wild pollinators were often considered a lot more effective. Alpro added that their almonds were grown in full accordance with the EU policy to protect bees and pollinators, which was one of the strictest regulatory systems in the world concerning the approval of pesticides. All pesticides on the market had been subjected to a thorough assessment to ensure a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment." ;

The first TV ad, seen in May and September 2023, featured stylised footage of a car driving through a city at night. In its opening shot, an electrical transmission tower threw off sparks as the car drove past it, while the voice-over stated, “Who said electrification can’t spark excitement when unplugged?”. On-screen text stated “FUELLED BY PETROL DRIVEN BY ELECTRIC” while a spark trailed the car through the streets. Along the way, the spark traversed electric vehicle charging cables while further on-screen text stated, “NO NEED TO PLUG IN”. As the voice-over said, “New Nissan Qashqai with e-POWER. A unique electrified experience, unplugged”, the spark leapt onto the “e-POWER” logo embossed on the side of the car, before tunnelling into the car’s motor through a stylised vortex. A close-up shot depicted the vehicle’s display screen featuring the text “Energy Flow”. The ad’s closing shots featured on-screen text that stated “New Nissan Qashqai with e-POWER, unplugged” and the Nissan logo. The ad’s opening shots were accompanied by small on-screen text that stated “*e-POWER comprises a 100% electric motor-driven system, powered by a lithium ion battery and a petrol engine”. b. The second TV ad, seen on 27 June 2023, featured a voice-over, visuals and on-screen text that were similar to those in ad (a). Ad (b) included an additional closing shot whose visuals depicted The Flash, a DC superhero, running around two Nissan cars and leaving a trail of sparks in his wake. The accompanying voice-over stated, “Nissan Qashqai and X-Trail with e-Power. Get your own electrical superpower like The Flash”." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "Upheld Ads (a) and (b) showed a Nissan Qashqai being driven around a city whilst a spark of electricity simultaneously traversed the city, including along electric vehicle charging cables that were plugged in to other cars, until it ultimately leapt onto the Nissan Qashqai’s “e-Power” badge. The ads featured a voice-over that stated, “Who said electrification can’t spark excitement when unplugged? New Nissan Qashqai with e-Power. A unique electrified experience unplugged”. The ads included on-screen text that stated “FUELLED BY PETROL DRIVEN BY ELECTRIC”, “NO NEED TO PLUG IN” and “New Nissan Qashqui with e-POWER A unique electrified experience, unplugged”. Ad (b) also included on-screen text and voice-over that stated “Nissan Qashqai and X-Trail with e-Power. Get your own electrified superpower”. The ads therefore placed strong emphasis on electricity as a means of power. We considered that viewers would understand the ads to mean that the advertised car used “e-Power”, a new, electric technology that did not require the car to be plugged in in the same way as electric powered vehicles. We understood that the “e-Power” technology used an electric motor to drive the cars’ wheels, but that the electric motor was powered either directly by petrol, or from a battery that was recharged by petrol. Additionally, the car had a regenerative braking system that recharged the battery. Therefore, whilst the car only drove using an electric motor, it nonetheless required petrol. As referenced above, the ad stated “FUELLED BY PETROL DRIVEN BY ELECTRIC”. It also included qualifying text that stated “*e-POWER comprises a 100% electric motor-driven system, powered by a lithium ion battery and a petrol engine”. We considered that whilst viewers may have understood from those claims that the car required petrol, because they were alongside claims about the car being driven by electric and the ad as a whole strongly emphasised the role of electricity in the car, the extent of the role petrol had in powering the car was unclear. Further, because “e-Power” was a unique and new technology, most consumers would not be aware of how it differed from other forms of hybrid technology. We therefore considered that the ads did not make the nature of the vehicle’s power source sufficiently clear. Furthermore, whilst the ad did not include any explicit claims in relation to the car’s environmental impact, we considered that by focusing on the car’s use of electricity, consumers were likely to understand that the car was a better choice for the environment than traditionally fuelled vehicles. However, because the ads did not make sufficiently clear the nature of the vehicle’s power source and because it required petrol to power the electric motor, which would produce tailpipe emissions, we considered that the ads were also misleading in this regard. We concluded that the ads did not make sufficiently clear the extent to which the car required petrol and were therefore misleading. Ads (a) and (b) breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 9.2 and 9.3 (Environmental claims)." ;

There was nothing in the ads to suggest it was a new type of 100% electric vehicle that did not need charging. They did not make any references to the car being fully electric, but instead made clear that it was part of their “e-Power” range. This was a unique system that was neither hybrid nor fully electric, but rather used a petrol engine and lithium-ion battery to power an electric motor which solely turned the wheels. This was different from conventional hybrids where the wheels were powered by a petrol engine, electric motor, or a combination of both. The driving experience between an “e-Power” car and a hybrid car was different; unlike driving a hybrid, which switched between power sources, the “e-Power” system did not do this and so was smooth throughout. They did not believe that their technology should be described as “hybrid”. They had always been fully transparent about the “e-Power” technology and were mindful that it was a new technology that consumers needed to understand. The ads included on-screen text which stated “FUELLED BY PETROL DRIVEN BY ELECTRIC” and “NO NEED TO PLUG IN”, as well as the qualifier “e-POWER comprises a 100% electric motor-driven system, powered by a lithium ion battery and a petrol engine”. These all appeared on screen for longer than the legally stipulated time for a consumer to read. These made clear that petrol was required for the vehicle to function, and there was no need to charge it, making it clear that the vehicle was not a 100% electric vehicle that needed charging. Given that they set out clearly that the car needed petrol, to fuel an electric motor that powered the wheels of the vehicle all of the time, they strongly believed that they had not been misleading in explaining “e-Power” technology and all that information was added to help consumers to understand it. The tagline “electrification sparking excitement” was used in reference to their entire range of electricity-based models, which also included fully electric cars, hybrids and mild hybrids. The close-up shot in each ad of the advertised cars’ display screen, which included the text “Energy Flow”, accurately depicted a feature of the car that showed the electric flow to the wheels. As the ads clearly stated “FUELLED BY PETROL” and there were no references to the vehicle being solely powered by electricity, and there were no claims as to fewer emissions, they did not consider that consumers would believe that the car had fewer emissions. Neither ad featured environmental claims and therefore they did not consider that the BCAP Code Rules on environmental claims were relevant. They said the ads were no longer being broadcast in the form complained of, and that in future they would include additional wording to clarify that the vehicle was not a fully electric vehicle and required petrol to fuel the electric motor. Clearcast believed the ad made clear how the car was powered and that it was not misleading. Although the ad referred to “electric” and “charging”, they believed it was acceptable to include these in an ad for a hybrid car because not needing to charge the advertised car was a legitimate point of difference between it and a fully electric car. Nonetheless, they recognised that they needed to make it clear in the advert that the advertised car was not solely powered by an electric battery to avoid confusion. They endorsed the advertisers’ comments that the drive system was unique, and that the on-screen text and qualifier gave a clear description of how the car was powered and made it clear that it was not solely powered by electricity. They also endorsed the advertisers’ comments about there being nothing in the ads about emissions. The avoidance of such claims, coupled with the references to the car having a petrol engine and being powered by petrol, made it clear the car was not emission free." ;

The 84 participants were subject to administrative proceedings and a fine of 750 euros each (for a total sum of 88,500 euros).

It is responsible for promoting the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises on responsible business conduct and for operating the complaints mechanism in the guidelines.
Both airlines are said to have made a significant number of misleading claims about reducing emissions, efficiency and alternative fuels. Additionally Virgin is said to have made misleading claims about net zero, and British Airways about offsets. These claims, individually and collectively, are said to downplay the current and likely future impact of each airline’s operations on the climate. This is on the basis the statements convey the incorrect impression that the airlines are in the process of eliminating the environmental impact of their flights. It is said this tells consumers that they can continue to fly frequently without worrying unduly about their carbon footprint, and it tells policy-makers that they do not need to take steps to moderate the growth in demand for flying. Possible’s position is that, if the world hopes to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, both of these messages are false.""" ;

They must not include a person or character whose example was likely to be followed by those aged under 18 years or who had strong appeal to those aged under-18. The ASA noted that Premier League footballers were considered high risk within the CAP guidance “Gambling and lotteries: Protecting under-18s” in terms of how likely they were to be of strong appeal to under-18s. Football was an activity in which a very significant proportion of under-18s participated directly on a frequent basis, and had a general interest in through following professional teams and players across a variety of media. There was also a highly developed infrastructure around organised participation and the sport had an exceptionally high media profile including popular, dedicated media for under-18s. Those who played at an elite level were likely to appeal strongly to children. We noted the ad included Philippe Coutinho, Jesse Lingard and Kalidou Koulibaly, who were all current Premier League footballers and would be well known to those who followed Premier League football, and in particular fans of the clubs they played for, including children. In addition, they had all played international football, and we considered based on those factors that all three footballers were likely to be of strong appeal to under-18s. We considered that it would have been acceptable for the ad to appear in a medium where under-18s, for all intents and purposes, could be entirely excluded from the audience. That would apply in circumstances where those who saw the ad had been robustly age-verified as being 18 or older, such as through marketing lists that had been validated by payment data or credit checking. We did not consider that marketing data inferred from user behaviour met that threshold. Because Twitter was a media environment where users self-verified on customer sign-up, and did not use robust age-verification, we considered that Ladbrokes had not excluded under-18s from the audience with the highest level of accuracy required for ads the content of which was likely to appeal strongly to under-18s. For those reasons, we considered that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules16.116.1Marketing communications for gambling must be socially responsible, with particular regard to the need to protect children, young persons and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or exploited.16.316.3Marketing communications must not:and16.3.1216.3.12be likely to be of strong appeal to children oryoung persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youthculture.They must not include a person or character whose example is likely tobe followed by those aged under 18 years or who has a strong appeal to thoseaged under 18.Where appropriate steps have been taken to limit the potential for anadvertisement to appeal strongly to under-18s, this rule does not prevent theadvertising of gambling products associated with activities that are themselvesof strong appeal to under-18s (for instance, certain sports or playing videogames).CAP has publishedguidance?onthe application of the rule, including for advertising of gambling productsassociated with activities that are themselves of strong appeal to under-18s.(Gambling)." ;

They said there were no calls to action, promotional offers or links back to the Ladbroke’s site. They said their marketing team had carefully incorporated CAP’s guidance on gambling ads having strong appeal to under-18s in their practices. They acknowledged that football and top-flight footballers were considered to carry a high risk of having strong appeal to children, and they had therefore made use of all available targeting and age-gating tools to remove under-18s from the ad’s audience. They said the Ladbroke’s Twitter feed and respective tweets could not be accessed by users unless Twitter had accepted their age as being over-18. They said they understood that Twitter users self-verified their age, and because that was not always accurate, they had added an additional level of assurance by targeting the ad on social media to reach only over-25s.

The first ad featured an individual in front of a slot machine holding a large amount of money, as they said, “I have over 200 grand in my bank account because I stopped going to casinos and started playing this mobile slots game where I haven’t spent any money; however, I can still win super big. It’s called Ignite Classic Slots […] I play for tons of reasons.

The second ad opened with a slot machine being played by an off-screen individual who said, “Lets go, winner […] be a miracle […] ” before the shot cut to a different individual in front of another slot machine who said, “Casinos are taking a gamble that you will take a gamble and lose all your money. Why not save that money and spend it on a much better thing? Download Ignite Classic Slots. Download from this video and you get 3 million free coins just for signing up.” At the same time a mobile phone notification appeared at the top and displayed text that stated “You just received [coin emoji] 3000000 coins”. The individual then continued, “When you play it’s a 100% hit rate […] even at level 1 you can play over 300 slot machines for free more than all machines in this casino combined […] it’s free to play, it’s free to download, and you get that big bonus right now.” At the same time, a carousel of slot machines was shown at the top of the video." ;

Ltd’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. The ASA understood that social casino apps emulated slot machines or other casino-based games. However, we understood consumers were unable to win or withdraw any real-world money or tangible prizes from such apps, and therefore, they were not gambling products. We further understood that, whilst real-world money was not required to play, there were in-game purchase options available which enabled consumers to buy in-game currency or additional gameplay features. Ad (a) featured an individual who said that, as a result of playing the Ignite Classic Slots app instead of gambling at casinos, they had over £200,000 in their bank account”. We noted that the scene was realistic; the individual was seen holding a substantial amount of real-world money and they appeared to be in a casino, sitting directly in front of a slot machine. Because of that, we considered consumers would interpret that to mean the individual featured had won a significant amount of real-world money via the app, despite not having spent any real money. Furthermore, in the context of the imagery of an individual holding a large amount of money, we considered that “win a lot” would be interpreted as winning a lot of real money. Later on in the ad, gameplay footage from Ignite Classic Slots appeared on screen, as the individual continued to speak. The featured gameplay emulated casino-based gambling such as slot machines and a roulette wheel, and we considered that consumers, seeing the gameplay footage alongside the individual situated in a casino and adjacent to a slot machine, would understand that Ignite Classic Slots was similar to traditional casino-based gambling and that it would be possible to win real-world money or other tangible prizes. We considered that impression was further reinforced by the description that the game was “designed by real casino experts” and that consumers would infer the app offered a similar casino experience. In addition, the ad contained numerous references to winning and odds, for example, “super-high odds” and “jackpot”. We considered such terminology was commonly associated with gambling and the chances of winning real-world money or prizes. Their inclusion in the ad contributed to the impression that consumers could gamble, win and withdraw real-world money through the Ignite Classic Slots app. Ad (b) featured an individual playing a slot machine in a casino who quickly becomes frustrated with losing their bet, juxtaposed with a different individual, also seen in a casino, who discussed the risk of losing one’s stake at a casino. Instead, the individual suggested that consumers should save the money they would have otherwise spent in a casino and use it to download the Ignite Classic Slots app. Because the ad contrasted losing within a casino environment and implied that it would be more beneficial to spend that money on the app, we considered consumers would interpret that to mean the experience of playing the game was analogous to gambling in a traditional casino, but unlike physical casinos, an individual’s chances of winning real-world money were higher when playing Ignite Classic Slots. That impression was reinforced by the statement that the app contained over 300 slot machines, which the second individual in the ad stated was, “more than all machines in this casino combined”. We considered that would be interpreted by consumers to mean the app provided an enhanced experience to playing traditional casino slot machines and, within the context of those comments, that individuals were likely to lose money at a casino and the probability of winning on the app was greater. We considered the slot gameplay footage, along with repeated references to “coins”, which were commonly associated with slot machines, and the phrases “big bonus” and “100% hit rate” further strengthened the impression that the app offered an enhanced experience of playing slot machines in a casino where real money would be won. However, we understood that Ignite Classic Slots was a social casino game, and users could neither win nor cash-out real-world money. We acknowledged that the function of the app was to emulate the experience of playing a slot machine or other casino-based games. However, we considered that consumers would interpret the ads to mean that, because the app was comparable to a real-life casino experience, consumers would be able to gamble as they would in a casino and win large amounts of real-world money. Because we considered the claims and imagery featured in the ads gave the impression that the apps were gambling products in which real-world money or tangible prizes could be won and withdrawn, we concluded that the ads were misleading and had breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading Advertising)." ;

The story of a food so natural, it takes the rain from the sky and plants we humans cannot eat, and turns it into something wonderful.” Rain falling on long blades of grass appeared on-screen. Superimposed text later in the ad stated “Red meat and dairy are a source of B12 and protein … B12 helps reduce tiredness and fatigue. Protein contributes to the maintenance of normal bones.” The voiceover continued, “Essential nutrients our bodies need to help us stay healthy” while a scene showed a silhouette of children running through fields. The voiceover stated “Meat” over a scene showing meat patties being fried, followed by “Dairy” while cheese was shown being grated. Superimposed text stated “A varied and balanced diet alongside a healthy lifestyle are recommended for good health”. A plate containing a piece of meat on a bed of rice, greens, kidney beans, sweetcorn and tomatoes appeared alongside superimposed text which stated “Eat Balanced” and “for more stories visit WeEatBalanced.com”. Logos for the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board and Red Tractor Certified Standards appeared at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen, while the voiceover stated, “Enjoy the food you eat. Eat balanced”. b. A large banner ad on a website featured the headline “TO B12 OR NOT TO B12?” against a backdrop of pieces of meat and peppers. Further text stated “Beef, pork, lamb and milk contain vitamin B12, an essential nutrient not naturally present in the vegan diet. Click to discover more”. Logos for the “Eat Balanced” campaign, the ADHB, and Red Tractor Certified Standards appeared in the bottom right corner, and small print text stated “Enjoy as part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle.” c. The YouTube video posted by ‘We Eat Balanced’, contained the same claims as ad (a) but featured a different plate containing steak and vegetables. Text in the video description stated “Open Beef Steak Sandwich and a glass of milk. An ideal diet is one that offers variety, nourishment and enjoyment whilst remaining in harmony with the environment. To keep you and your family healthy it’s best to follow a balanced diet. Meat and dairy naturally provide nutrients, including the essential vitamin B12 not naturally present in a vegan diet. Enjoy the food you eat. Eat balanced”. d. the Facebook post by ‘We Eat Balanced’, included a video containing the same claims as ad (a). The caption stated “AHDB has started the #WeEatBalanced conversation to set out evidence about the benefits of the UK farming sector and to help consumers make an informed personal choice on diet and nutrition. We all have different dietary requirements, family needs and budgets and we are presenting a choice to enjoy in such difficult times as we look for meal inspiration”." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1. Not upheld Ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) included claims such as “Essential nutrients our bodies need to help us stay healthy”, “Eat Balanced” and “A varied and balanced diet alongside a healthy lifestyle are recommended for good health” alongside shots of different meals including meat and dairy, among other ingredients. They also included nutrition and health claims such as “Beef, pork, lamb and milk contain vitamin B12, an essential nutrient not naturally present in the vegan diet” and “Red meat and dairy are a source of B12 and protein … B12 helps reduce tiredness and fatigue. Protein contributes to the maintenance of normal bones”. Ad (c) included the claim “To keep you and your family healthy it’s best to follow a balanced diet. Meat and dairy naturally provide nutrients, including the essential vitamin B12 not naturally present in a vegan diet”. Ad (d) referred to the “choice” and “personal choice” of consumers to include different types of foods in their diets. We understood that meat and dairy products contained sufficient quantities of vitamin B12 and protein that the nutrition and health claims included in the ads were permitted to be made. Overall, we considered that the ads would be understood by consumers to mean that essential nutrients required for humans could be obtained from meat and dairy foods as part of a healthy and balanced diet. We referred to the NHS Eatwell Guide, which defined government recommendations on eating healthily and achieving a balanced diet. The Guide recommended eating protein, which could come from meat or from other sources, such as nuts and pulses. It also recommended consuming dairy or dairy alternatives, such as soy milk. The ads did not state that consumers could not obtain a balanced and healthy diet unless they ate meat or dairy. We did not consider that consumers would interpret the ad to mean that consumption of meat and dairy was required to be healthy, but rather that meat and dairy products provided a choice of food options that could contribute to an overall healthy, varied diet. There was nothing in the ads to suggest that consumers should consume meat or dairy in proportions that went beyond NHS health and nutrition advice. We concluded that ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) did not give a misleading impression that meat and dairy were required for a healthy and balanced diet. On that point, we investigated the ads under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Advertisements must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.3.33.3Ofcom must ensure that the standards from time to time in force under this section include:a) minimum standards applicable to all programmes included in television and radio services; andb) such other standards applicable to particular descriptions of programmes, or of television and radio services, as appeared to them appropriate for securing the standards objectives.\"Section3.93.9Broadcasters must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that the audience is likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

Not upheld We considered that consumers would understand the claims and “Beef, pork, lamb and milk contain vitamin B12, an essential nutrient not naturally present in the vegan diet” alongside the claim “Enjoy as part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle” in ad (b) to mean that vitamin B12 was an essential nutrient that was only found naturally in beef, pork, lamb and milk, and could not be found naturally in a vegan diet. While we noted that some consumers might interpret the claim “TO B12 OR NOT TO B12?”, in isolation, to suggest a binary choice between eating meat and dairy and obtaining vitamin B12, or not eating those food groups and not obtaining the nutrient as a result, in the context of the ad we considered it was likely to be understood as a play on words referring to the fact that some foods were natural sources of B12. We considered that the claims “To keep you and your family healthy it’s best to follow a balanced diet. Meat and dairy naturally provide nutrients, including the essential vitamin B12 not naturally present in a vegan diet” alongside the claim “Enjoy the food you eat. Eat balanced” in ad (c) would be understood in the same way as in ad (b). We understood that beef, pork, lamb and milk were natural sources of vitamin B12. We referred to the NHS advice on vegetarian and vegan diets, which stated that vitamin B12 was only found naturally in foods from animal sources, and that because sources of vitamin B12 for vegans were limited, supplements or fortified foods might be needed. We therefore considered that it was factually accurate to state that vitamin B12 was not naturally present in a vegan diet. We considered that consumers would understand that while the nutrient was not naturally present in plant-based foods, it could readily be obtained through supplements and a variety of fortified vegan foods, and therefore the ad was unlikely to give the impression that it was not possible to consume sufficient levels of B12 while following a vegan diet. We concluded that ads (b) and (c) did not give a misleading impression that eating meat and dairy was required to obtain vitamin B12. On that point, we investigated the ads under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Advertisements must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.3.33.3Ofcom must ensure that the standards from time to time in force under this section include:a) minimum standards applicable to all programmes included in television and radio services; andb) such other standards applicable to particular descriptions of programmes, or of television and radio services, as appeared to them appropriate for securing the standards objectives.\"Section3.93.9Broadcasters must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that the audience is likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

Advertisements must make clear their commercial intent, if that is not obvious from the context.(Substantiation), but did not find them in breach. 3. Not upheld The video shown in ads (a), (c) and (d) included scenery featuring rolling fields with cattle and sheep grazing, an open field with pigs and livestock shelters, rain falling on grass, and images of meals including dairy products and meat. The ad specifically referred to beef, pork, lamb and dairy. We considered that consumers would understand that the images of livestock were representative of how some cattle, sheep and pigs were farmed in the UK. There was nothing to suggest that all cattle, pigs and sheep in the UK were kept in similar conditions, in terms of their access to outdoor space. Neither did the video refer to any other type of farmed animal, such as chickens. We further noted that the predominant theme of the video was the health and nutritional attributes of meat and dairy, and different ways they could be incorporated into people’s diets, and that was what consumers were likely to be focused on. According to the Government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (Defra) Cattle Farm Practices survey from April 2019, 87% of farms with cattle in the UK used a mix of housed and grazing systems for their cattle. Furthermore, we understood that many pigs in the UK were kept in outdoor systems like those shown in the ad, and that the majority of sheep were housed outdoors. Therefore, we considered that the images of animals in the ad, as they were likely to be understood by consumers, were unlikely to mislead. We considered that the claim “a food so natural that it takes the rain from the sky and the plants we humans cannot eat” alongside the scenery of rolling fields, and rain falling on grass, was likely to be understood to mean that the animals in the ads converted water and energy from plants such as grass into simple foods that did not contain additives and reached consumers in a state that had been subject to minimal processing. Given that the foodstuffs being promoted were unprocessed beef, pork, and lamb, and dairy products of a traditional nature subject to minimal processing such as milk and cheese, we considered they were likely to be in line with consumer expectations of “natural”. We noted that some complainants considered that the description “natural” was misleading because they believed that certain farming practices, such as the removal of calves from their mothers and the docking of pigs’ tails, were not “natural”. Other complainants believed the claim “natural” implied that meat and dairy farming in the UK had a minimal environmental impact, or was an essential part of the ecological system, particularly in combination with the references to “rain from the sky” and “plants we humans cannot eat”. We understood that the AHDB had conducted a market research survey of 1,200 people to assess consumer perception of their ad campaign. Among the participants there was a targeted sub-group of 200 people who were considering reducing their meat and dairy consumption and used social media channels with an interest in health and ethical living and 35% of those 200 people considered that dairy could be described as \"produced in a sustainable way\" after having seen the ad, which was an increase of eight percentage points from 27% before the campaign. However, we did not consider that research was sufficient to indicate that the average consumer would understand the ads to mean that farming was “sustainable”. We considered that the average consumer was likely to understand the claim in the context of the nature of the resulting food, rather than the lifecycle of livestock or the impact of farming on the environment. Consumers would likely understand that lives of farmed animals differed significantly in many ways from how they would originally have lived in the wild. We understood that the majority of the diet of cattle and sheep in the UK was made up of grass and that pig feed also included crops and by-products that could not be eaten by humans. In any case, there was nothing in the ad to suggest that those animals exclusively ate plants that could not be eaten by humans. We considered that the ads did not go so far as to suggest that the scenes shown were representative of all livestock farming in the UK, or that farming had a minimal environmental impact. We concluded that ads (a), (c) and (d) were not misleading. On that point, we investigated the ads under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Advertisements must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.3.33.3Ofcom must ensure that the standards from time to time in force under this section include:a) minimum standards applicable to all programmes included in television and radio services; andb) such other standards applicable to particular descriptions of programmes, or of television and radio services, as appeared to them appropriate for securing the standards objectives.\"Section3.93.9Broadcasters must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that the audience is likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

The AHDB said that they were an executive non-departmental UK public body, sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and funded by farmers, growers and other parties in the supply chain. They stated that they wanted to address common consumer misconceptions about the sustainability of red meat and dairy produced in Britain when compared to global livestock production and other sectors in the UK and to highlight the role red meat and dairy played in a balanced diet. The AHDB said that their intention with ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) was to raise awareness of the nutrients meat and dairy foods could offer if eaten as part of a healthy and balanced diet. They said they used qualifying statements to promote a varied diet and to clarify that meat and dairy consumption was not required. They said that the ads directed consumers to more detailed information by providing links to the website weeatbalanced.com. They said that red meat and dairy were included in the Government’s Eatwell Guide, which they used as a guide, and in line with National Diet & Nutrition Surveys, they also sought to inform consumers and provide a balanced view regarding the health effects of consuming red meat. The website outlined limits set on red meat consumption by the NHS. For those reason, the AHDB maintained that the ads were not misleading. 2. The AHDB said that the claims in ads (b) and (c) did not omit material information and that steps were taken to avoid consumers being misled. Their intention was to raise awareness that foods of plant origin were not natural sources of vitamin B12 and this was substantiated by the NHS website and the Vegan Society’s website. Ad (c) used images of farming, landscapes and animals in the UK to show that red meat and dairy were a natural source of vitamin B12 and it was factually correct that vitamin B12 was not synthesized in the body and therefore needed to be present in the diet. They said that the NHS listed meat, milk and cheese as sources of vitamin B12. The ads did not claim that red meat and dairy were the only sources for protein and vitamin B12 and they did not consider that the average consumer would have understood that to be the case from the ads. The AHDB said that the claims did not go beyond the AHDB guides to understanding nutrition and health claims regulations for beef, lamb and pork, on which they had been given Assured Advice by their Primary Authority. They said that the British Nutrition Foundation had advised them that \"natural\" or \"naturally\" could be regarded as meaning without “refining, chemical extraction, genetic modification, cloning or with addition of additives or fortificants”, which reflected the guidance set out by the Food Standards Agency. 3. The AHDB said that the ads did not omit material information or seek to mislead consumers, and that consumers were directed in the ads to the weeatbalanced.com website to obtain more detailed information than the ads could provide within limited time and space. The website defined sustainable production for British livestock in terms of carbon footprint, water, land use and food waste, and these areas were broadly understood by consumers when talking about the environment. The website contained links to the sources for each of the claims to enable consumers to find out more. The AHDB said it was factually correct that UK livestock was typically grazed outdoors. Red meat production systems in the UK were predominantly outdoor, land-based systems as a result of the UK climate and landscape. All sheep in Britain were housed outdoors and 95% of all cattle were outdoors from spring to autumn. They said that the UK had the largest population of outdoor pigs in Europe, with over 40% of breeding females outdoors. They maintained that the imagery and wording used in the ads, namely that UK livestock production was land-based, and used foods humans could not eat and rainwater, to produce meat and milk, reflected typical UK production systems in beef, lamb and dairy and typical commercial outdoor pig units. The AHDB cited a report by the Centre for Innovation Excellence in Livestock, which they said stated that the carbon footprint of UK beef was half the global average, while the footprint of UK dairy was a third lower than the global average. They said that the report also stated that all UK livestock emitted 6% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions, compared to 28% for transport, 23% for energy, 18% for businesses and 15% for homes. They said that the UK's topography and climate limited the types of animal and plant species that could be reared for food; 65% of the UK had permanent grassland or rough grazing. Raising animals for meat and milk therefore made optimal use of the UK’s natural resources. They said that well-managed grazing lands provided habitats for shelter, feeding and breeding, and helped enhance ecosystems and biodiversity and that removal of livestock in certain UK landscapes could have detrimental impacts on land quality and flora and fauna biodiversity. They said that cattle and sheep predominantly fed on grass, and that very little of their diet was edible for humans. Just under 50% of pig diets were made up of human food by- and co-products and the inclusion of soya in pig diets was around 10% and rainwater made up 87% of the water footprint for cattle, sheep and pigs. AHDB said they believed that the average consumer would infer from the ads and supporting information at weeatbalanced.com that British meat and dairy production, when compared to global meat production and the environmental impact of other sectors in the UK, was sustainably produced and environmentally beneficial. They felt that the ads were therefore not misleading. 1. & 3. Clearcast said that they had considered the TV ad and supporting evidence from the AHDB carefully and asked for several amendments to the ad before they were satisfied that it was acceptable. They believed that the TV ad explained that meat and dairy provided essential nutrients to humans in order to stay healthy. They said that as this was a general health claim, it was accompanied by a specific health claim super in accordance with the relevant rules. The ad explained that meat and dairy farming was reliant on natural elements like rain, grass and the sun for the production of essential nutrients like B12; humans on a diet of grass and rain water would not be capable of manufacturing such nutrients. The TV ad showed a plate of food incorporating these ingredients showing how they contributed towards a balanced and varied diet and was followed by the We Eat Balanced website, which offered advice on recipes, how to eat healthily and sustainably and how to cut waste. They said that the ad did not state that meat and dairy were the only ways of achieving a healthy balanced diet, rather that they contained some of the essential nutrients that a healthy, balanced diet required. They said that the ad showed scenes of farms and nature with cows grazing in a field as advocated by Red Tractor standards. The ad made no claims about how livestock in the UK were grazed and made no environmental claims. The ads used typical depictions of UK farm life to advertise authorised health claims for their products which conformed to the BCAP and EFSA codes. For those reasons, Clearcast said that they did not believe the ads were misleading and they considered that all the claims had been substantiated." ;

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but challenging different carbon credit projects. The REDD+ 2252 project, which is the subject of the lawsuit, overlaps the areas of 5 State Agro-Extractivist Settlement Projects (PEAEX). These PEAEX are public lands, whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 2252 generates REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and increased forest carbon stocks), was certified by an international company and has been established since 2016 to generate carbon credits for thirty years. Companies and individuals are sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of rural properties where it is located. The DPE-PA alleges irregularities in the property registrations that make up the project, and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. In addition, the mayor of Portel issued a Public Utility Decree authorising its operation, which the DPE-PA argues is unconstitutional. It is emphasised that the project was implemented without a prior technical study. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, that they did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and the concession of public forests and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. It argues that the defendants' behaviour entails the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) the recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) the suspension of Project 2252 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 2252 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel." ;

The submission argues that BP Senior Executives allegedly committed a crime against humanity by knowingly causing and perpetuating climate change while pursuing activities in the oil and gas industry. The submission alleges that since the 1950s, BP Senior Executives have been aware of the climate implications of the corporation’s oil and gas activities because of internal studies conducted into
greenhouse gases. The results of these studies have allegedly been withheld from the public. The submission further argues that as of the 1990s, BP Senior Executives have admitted their role in perpetuating climate change in company documentaries where a link was made between the corporation’s activities and climate change. In prioritizing profits from oil activities, BP Senior Executives are alleged to have engaged in the following harmful behaviors:
- Creating doubt by sowing distrust in climate change science
- Entrenching dependency on BP’s petroleum products on the false pretense that they are a necessary and viable solution to climate change
- Causing delays to urgent climate policy by portraying climate change as a far-future issue
- Fostering deception of governments and the wider public through misleading marketing of BP as a renewable energy company, using strategic communications to shift responsibilities for carbon emissions onto individuals, and promoting false solutions, such as yet-to-be- invented technology, that prolong the use of fossil fuels

Furthermore, the MoEF also argued that the defendants had failed to fulfill its obligation to prevent any fires inside its concessions. The MoEF added that these unlawful acts caused damages on ecosystem and the peatlands. Hence, the MoEF sought compensation for all the damages and restoration costs amounting to IDR 199 billion. For the climate damages, the MoEF argued that the fires had contributed to the release of 2,250 tC and a loss of function of carbon sinks which equal to 787.5 tC.

The plaintiff informs that INEA, when granting the Integrated environmental license disregarded the synergistic and cumulative impacts with the request for a license to install and operate four floating Thermoelectric Plants in the same region, which are part of the same project. It argues that both the temporary towers for power transmission lines and the floating Thermoelectric Plants should be analyzed together and that there was an absence of an Environmental Impact Study/Environmental Impact Report (EIA/RIMA) and of a public hearing with the participation of the local community. The MPF points out that thermoelectric enterprises are generators of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pollution. For this reason, INEA should require prior studies to assess the contribution of the project to climate change, taking into account the objectives of the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.189/2009) and the goals assumed by Brazil in the Paris Agreement.It raises the special protection of the Atlantic Forest biome (under Federal Law 11.428/2006) when it comes to suppression of vegetation.

The ASA considered that while many listeners would understand from the ad that Flight 100 had, uniquely, flown transatlantic using only sustainable aviation fuel, a significant proportion would understand the claim “100% sustainable aviation fuel” to mean that the fuel used was 100% sustainable. We understood that the term sustainable aviation fuel was widely used in the aviation industry and by governmental and other bodies to refer to biofuels and synthetic fuels – fuels which were not from fossil derived sources – and which had reduced impacts on the environment based on their resourcing and lifecycle emissions, compared to fossil derived aviation fuel. We considered most consumers were likely to be aware that aviation was a high carbon-emitting sector, due largely to its use of fossil derived aviation fuels, and would understand from the term sustainable aviation fuel that it had a less harmful impact on the environment than fossil derived aviation fuels. However, they were unlikely to be aware of the extent to which fuels described as sustainable aviation fuel still had negative environmental impacts, and in what ways. Those listeners who interpreted the claim “100% sustainable aviation fuel” to mean that the fuel was 100% sustainable were likely to expect that it had no negative environmental impacts at all. We considered the consumer opinion survey Virgin had commissioned confirmed the limited knowledge and lack of clarity amongst consumers about the environmental impact of sustainable aviation fuel, both in general and specifically after listening to the ad. While 68% of respondents said they understood from the ad that sustainable aviation fuel was “significantly” or “somewhat” better for the environment than traditional jet fuel, a further 15% understood it had the same impact as jet fuel, and 6% understood it was “somewhat” or “significantly” worse for the environment; 11% understood that sustainable aviation fuel had zero environmental impact. There were therefore significant minorities of respondents who did not have an accurate understanding of the environmental impact of sustainable aviation fuel after listening to the ad. Additionally, in response to a further true/false question, roughly 30% of respondents believed a statement that sustainable aviation fuel had “zero impact on the environment” was true. A significant number of respondents therefore responded differently than they had to the previous question, which we considered further indicated consumers’ confusion. We acknowledged that the specific sustainable aviation fuel mix used for Flight 100 was calculated to have delivered savings of 64% in greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil derived aviation fuel over its full lifecycle, but that was not stated in the ad. Additionally, while that was a significant reduction, we nonetheless understood that sustainable aviation fuel still produced significant emissions over its lifecycle. This included significant CO2, nitrous oxide and other climate-impacting emissions during flight, and that its production was not without other potentially negative environmental impacts in the longer term. For example, this included the diversion of biofuels from other sectors which might then revert back to fossil derived fuels, and the impact of land use changes, both direct and indirect. We therefore considered that in the absence of information in the ad which explained that sustainable aviation fuel produced reduced, but still significant, emissions over its full lifecycle, including in-flight emissions, and which explained the ways in which the fuel otherwise significantly adversely impacted the environment, a significant proportion of listeners were likely to overestimate its environmental benefits. We acknowledged the ad specifically highlighted Flight 100, which was a non-commercial flight for which listeners could not purchase tickets. However, it had the effect of building the overall impression that Virgin Atlantic was committed to taking on a challenging, pioneering and continuing role in working towards reducing the environmental impact of aviation. We considered many listeners would be interested in seeking out airlines that were taking such action. The ad specifically highlighted the use of sustainable aviation fuel in Flight 100; a method by which a reduction in environmental impact could be achieved. We therefore considered that information about its limitations in that regard constituted material information that would have an impact on the transactional decisions of those listeners. We therefore concluded that the unqualified claim “100% sustainable aviation fuel” was misleading. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 and 3.2 (Misleading advertising), 9.2, 9.3, and 9.5 (Environmental claims)." ;

The aim was to build on previous research and to further the understanding of the technical and operational feasibility of using 100% sustainable aviation fuel in a commercial passenger aircraft. The standards currently in place allowed only for a maximum of 50% sustainable aviation fuel to be used, blended with fossil derived fuel. Flight 100 demonstrated that sustainable aviation fuel could be used as a full replacement for fossil derived jet fuel in existing aircraft, supported by existing fuel infrastructure. Virgin said that an element of their competition bid to the DfT was the intention that the flight would improve transparency and understanding around sustainable aviation fuel and its environmental impacts for both the wider industry and the public. Virgin Atlantic emphasised that the ad’s wording “… become the world’s first commercial airline to fly transatlantic, on 100% sustainable aviation fuel” mirrored the terms used by the DfT in its competition invitation, as quoted above. They believed consumers would understand the term “100% sustainable aviation fuel” in the context of the ad to be a reference to a type of fuel which was made from sustainable sources, rather than being fossil fuel based, and which reduced but did not necessarily completely eliminate greenhouse gases. They did not think listeners would understand the ad to mean that the fuel used for Flight 100 was derived from completely sustainable sources, did not generate CO2 or other emissions that had an adverse environmental impact during use, and that over its full lifecycle had no adverse environmental impacts. The ad did not claim that the fuel was 100% sustainable, nor did it give a misleading impression about the absolute or relative environmental nature, impact or credentials of sustainable aviation fuel (as compared to other aviation fuel). Rather, it factually described how the flight was powered exclusively by sustainable aviation fuel. They referred to a survey they had undertaken, after receiving notification from the ASA about the complaint, to see what people understood from the ad. They said the key outcomes were that: overall, listeners considered it was easy to understand; the majority understood that the claim related to the proportion of sustainable aviation fuel used; and the majority (68%) understood from the ad that sustainable aviation fuel was better for the environment than traditional jet fuel, but that it was not without any adverse impact. They said the ASA recognised that most consumers understood aviation’s carbon emissions due to fossil fuel use and that they would infer that “sustainable aviation fuel” had a lesser environmental impact. They therefore believed the ad did not omit or present information unclearly, because the ad accurately stated that Flight 100 was powered solely by sustainable aviation fuel. They said that even if relevant information had been omitted from the ad, it was not ‘material’ information as referenced in the Code: that was information that consumers needed in context to make informed decisions about whether or how to buy a product or service. The ad did not advertise Virgin Atlantic’s products or services. It was instead showcasing a one-off research and development flight that did not operate as a normal commercial service. It therefore could not be said to lack any information that was necessary (rather than information that would assist, or be relevant) to enable the average consumer to take an informed transactional decision. They said that in any event, a further survey they had conducted since receiving notification from the ASA identified that sustainability factors influenced only around 1.5% of consumer’s overall choice about long-haul airlines. They said the term “sustainable aviation fuel” was used universally by governments, regulators, industry bodies, fuel companies, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), airlines, academia, aircraft and engine manufacturers and mainstream media. The ad therefore accurately referred to the type of fuel by its universally recognised and used definition. The term was used for synthetic aviation fuel that was not derived from fossil fuel. It encompassed fuel made from waste or renewable feedstocks. There were various feedstock sources and technology pathways that could be deployed to produce it. Differing criteria for sustainable aviation fuel existed, but the most widely used was the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) sustainability criteria established by the ICAO, a United Nations agency. The primary criteria were: (1) greenhouse gas reductions of at least 10% compared to the baseline lifecycle emissions values for aviation fuel on a lifecycle basis; (2) the fuel was not made from biomass obtained from land-aquatic systems with a high biogenic carbon stock; and (3) emissions reductions attributed to CORSIA sustainable aviation fuel should be permanent. Sustainable aviation fuel was certified by independent certification entities. The most common certifications were issued by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) and Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB). Methodologies to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas savings of sustainable aviation fuel compared to conventional fossil derived fuels were in accordance with those stipulated by the UK government, the European Union and industry bodies. They compared the greenhouse gas lifecycle emissions of biofuel sources to the extraction and processing of raw fossil feedstocks into crude oil and subsequent refinement into fossil jet fuel. The methodological approach was not specific to aviation, and full lifecycle assessments were used globally and across industry to establish baseline emissions and reductions from alternatives to fossil derived fuels. Virgin Atlantic said that under current fuel standards it was not permissible to blend different types of sustainable aviation fuels together, but they had received permission to do so for Flight 100, which combined two types. The first, Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK), was made using waste oils and lipids from animal fats. Those animal fats were deemed unfit for human consumption, and so converting them into biofuels represented the only viable means of reusing an otherwise wasted resource. SPK comprised 87.6% of the fuel used for Flight 100. The lifecycle emissions for the SPK were calculated in compliance with the relevant EU Renewable Energy Directive and ISCC methodologies. The other 12.4% of the fuel mix was comprised of Synthesised Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), a synthetic fuel derived from dextrose. It used sugars from isolated industrial corn starch, with the remaining portion of the corn’s oil, protein and fibre remaining available for the feed and food supply chains. SAK was at a developmental stage and was being produced in extremely small volumes until it had achieved approval under the International Standard which certified the safety of jet fuel. Once the fuel had achieved that certification a second process would be triggered for the manufacturing plant to be certified as CORSIA compliant. In the meantime, the methodology used to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for SAK was the methodology required under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which was consistent with industry standards for the production of bio-based fuels. Prior to the flight, a consultancy firm calculated the carbon emissions across the full lifecycle of a Virgin Atlantic flight using traditional jet fuel, on the same route and aircraft type as Flight 100. It indicated that 97% of the greenhouse gas emissions generated were derived from fuel use. Virgin Atlantic confirmed that sustainable aviation fuel produced the same level of CO2 emissions during flight as traditional jet fuel. However, because sustainable aviation fuel utilised carbon that had recently been captured from the atmosphere, the CO2 savings were relative to a net increase in atmospheric carbon that would have been emitted had fossil fuels been dug up and used. Additional savings could also be realised through a reduction in lifecycle emissions from extraction, processing, manufacturing, transportation of the fuel, and through improving operational efficiencies. Flight 100 had trialled various operational efficiencies, including fuel burn efficiencies. Overall, Flight 100 had delivered a lifecycle CO2 emissions saving of 64%. The deployment of sustainable aviation fuel therefore represented a significant reduction in emissions.In addition, Flight 100’s fuel produced around 40% lower non-CO2 emissions (particulates such as water, sulphur oxides, soot and nitrous oxides) compared to fossil derived fuels. They had also mitigated for the potential that Flight 100 would result in contrail formation, but on the day relevant software had indicated there was no likelihood of that happening. Finally, Virgin Atlantic would purchase carbon removal credits to mitigate the residual CO2 from Flight 100. Radiocentre took advice from an independent external consultant, who said that “sustainable aviation fuel” was defined by the UK Government under the renewable transport fuel obligation. Radiocentre noted that the term was used by the World Economic Forum, International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the DfT to describe that category of aviation fuel. They were advised that commercial aircraft were already approved to use sustainable aviation fuel up to a maximum blend of 50% with conventional jet fuel, although typical blend rates were at between 10% and 30%.Radiocentre also considered the broader implications of the services being described as “sustainable”, and were careful to ensure the ad did not make or imply such a claim for the airline’s service. Instead, the ad focused solely on Virgin Atlantic’s claim that Flight 100 was the first commercial transatlantic flight to be powered only by sustainable aviation fuel." ;

The ads opened with a man in the bath with a mobile phone in his hand. The house he was in had a car on the driveway and was on the back of a truck driving along on a motorway. Four more cars were later shown driving on the same road and alongside the truck with prices above them and the word “dealer” and a number written on the side of the car. The ASA understood that the cars represented potential buyers and the bids they had made for the car on the truck which was being sold. The cars were shown overtaking each other which we understood was intended to show the dealers outbidding each other until the highest bid was made and the car representing that deal was out in front. We acknowledged that some elements of the ad were fantastical, such as the house being on the back of a trailer, the man jumping from the car into the truck. We also accepted the ad was styled as a computer game with bids appearing above the cars, before the seller accepted a bid on his phone. However, we noted that the scene was set on a motorway with ordinary cars and drivers which would be recognisable to viewers as a real-life setting. The cars were shown engaging in some level of competition to get ahead by sharply overtaking each other and weaving in and out of lanes. We considered the driving manoeuvres featured would be dangerous and irresponsible if emulated in real life on a public highway. The drivers were shown smiling, laughing and pleased about overtaking the other cars in that manner, which we considered condoned the competitive style of driving depicted. Because we considered the driving depicted in the ads condoned competitive and unsafe driving, we concluded the ads were irresponsible. Ad (a) breached BCAP Code rules1.21.2Advertisements must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to the audience and to society.(Social responsibility) and20.120.1Advertisements must not condone or encourage dangerous, competitive, inconsiderate or irresponsible driving or motorcycling. Advertisements must not suggest that driving or motorcycling safely is staid or boring.(Motoring) and ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules1.31.3Advertisements must comply with the law and broadcasters must make that a condition of acceptance.(Social responsibility) and19.219.2Advertisements must not feature, imply, condone or encourage irresponsible or immoderate drinking. That applies to both the amount of drink and the way drinking is portrayed.References to, or suggestions of, buying repeat rounds of alcoholic drinks are not acceptable. That does not prevent, for example, someone buying a drink for each member of a group. It does, however, prevent any suggestion that other members of the group will buy a round.(Motoring)." ;

They said that at the start of the ads, the man was shown using the Motorway service to sell his car while in the bath. Once he had selected his car, a full sized brick house was shown on the back of a truck with Motorway branding being driven down an empty motorway. Motorway said those scenes cemented the idea that ad was not set in the real world and that the bath scene, which was seen several times, emphasised that it was fantastical and was happening in the man’s imagination. Motorway said the ads also communicated that different dealers had bid on the car that was being sold to get the seller the best price. They said the cars were numbered and did not look like everyday cars. They believed the computer game style graphic “price bids” which appeared above the cars added to the unrealistic scenery. Motorway said the driving style was very choreographed and showed the drivers were in complete control at all times. They said this was supported by the driver’s relaxed demeanour and showed the simplicity of the Motorway service. They said their research demonstrated that consumers understood that Motorway offered a service where car dealers submitted price bids on cars for sale and that it was reasonable that viewers would attribute the car dealers smiles to the price bids placed on the seller’s car. They said the stunt which showed one of the drivers jumping into the cab of the truck from one of the cars was also designed to show that it was set in a controlled environment and not on a real motorway. In the final scene, the truck was seen heading off into the sunset on an empty non-descript motorway as part of the sellers imagination. In relation to the TV ad, Clearcast said they gave advice to the agency that the driving scenes should be clearly hyperbolic and that the scene where the driver climbs out of the moving van into the cabin should be surreal and look over the top, so that nothing in the ad would be easy to emulate. They said they also advised that the road should be clearly closed off and shouldn’t look as it if it was in the real world, which was achieved by making sure the cars were the only vehicles on the road. The ad showed a man in his bathtub, while his house was on the back of a truck and the computer style graphic flashing prices above the cars also further helped to create the fantastical setting. They said the ad was in an unrealistic, over-the-top setting. All 4 said the VOD ad had been approved by Clearcast." ;

                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/ad_description> "A TV ad for Aqua Pura, seen in August 2021, featured people drinking from bottles of Aqua Pura whilst enjoying time outdoors in nature. A voice-over said, “In Cumbria there’s more to water. From clouds up high, down hill and fell and mountainside. Flowing deep for years. Nature purifies on its journey to finding you. Bottle it up, guzzle it down, bathe the hills and quench the towns. For this is aqua. Nothing purer, it’s nature friendly we assure you. Crush it down, take it back, we’ll make plenty more with that. So take a sip of Cumbria. Go out, go far, go live. Aqua Pura. Hydration for the nation.” The ad ended with two bottles of Aqua Pura on a rock with a backdrop of a lake and rolling green hills, the Aqua Pura logo and text that said “Hydration for the Nation” and “100% recycled & recyclable bottle with eco-friendly cap*”. The asterisk linked to text on screen that said “*relates to 500ml bottles only”." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1. Upheld The ad ended with on-screen text that stated “100% recycled & recyclable bottle with eco-friendly cap*” alongside two bottles, including the cap and label, of Aqua Pura water. The ASA considered consumers would understand the first part of the claim, “100% recycled & recyclable bottle”, to mean that all components of the bottle, i.e. the bottle, cap and label, had been made using 100% recycled materials and could all be recycled. We considered that the continuation of the claim with the phrasing “... with eco-friendly cap*” was ambiguous in its meaning. We considered it might be understood by some viewers to distinguish the cap from the rest of the bottle and therefore that it was excluded from the “100% recycled & recyclable” claim. However, we considered that most would understand from the claim in its entirety that the cap was 100% recycled and recyclable, and that there was an additional environmental benefit provided by the cap (discussed at Point 3 below). We noted that the ad only included shots of 500 ml bottles of Aqua Pura, and that the qualifying text “*relates to 500ml bottles only” was included at the end, which was linked by asterisk to the claim “100% recycled & recyclable bottle with eco-friendly cap*”. We considered that consumers would understand that qualifying text to mean that only 500 ml bottles of Aqua Pura were 100% recycled and recyclable, and came with the “eco-friendly” cap. We therefore expected to see evidence that all components of the 500 ml bottles were made from 100% recycled material. We understood from the reports provided that Aqua Pura 500 ml still and sparkling water bottles were made from 100% recycled PET. However, we understood that the cap and label were not made from recycled material. Because viewers would understand the claim to mean that all elements of the bottle were made entirely from recycled materials and that was not the case, we concluded the claim “100% recycled … bottle” had not been substantiated and was therefore misleading. On that point, the ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation) and 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5 (Environmental claims). 2. Not upheld As referenced above, we considered consumers would understand from the claim “100% recycled & recyclable bottle with eco-friendly cap*” and the qualification “*relates to 500ml bottles only” that the 500 ml bottle, label and cap were made from 100% recycled material and could be recycled. We therefore expected to see evidence that all components of the 500 ml bottles could be recycled. We understood from the recycling certification report and additional documentation that Aqua Pura 500 ml still and sparkling water bottles along with their cap and label were processed into the clear plastic stream during the recyclability testing. During the recycling process, the cap and label were separated from the bottle and sent for further recycling. The bottles would be sent to a processor to be made into PET flakes or pellets. We therefore understood all the components of the bottle were recyclable. Because viewers would understand the claim to mean that all components of the bottle were recyclable, and we had seen evidence that was the case, we concluded the claim “100% … recyclable bottle” was substantiated and was not misleading. On that point, we investigated the ad under BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation) and 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5 (Environmental claims), but did not find it in breach. 3. Upheld The BCAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear. It required that absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation, but that claims such as “friendlier” could be justified if the advertised product or service provided a total environmental benefit over that of the advertiser’s previous product or service or competitor products or services and the basis of the comparison was clear. It also said that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise. We considered viewers would understand the claim “eco-friendly cap” to mean the cap was not harmful to the environment in any way, throughout the full life cycle of the product. For the same reason as referenced at Point 1, we considered it was clear that the claim related only to the caps on Aqua Pura 500ml bottles. We considered the claim “eco-friendly cap” was an absolute claim. We therefore expected to see evidence that demonstrated the cap was not harmful to the environment at any point during its full life cycle. However, we had not seen such evidence. We acknowledged that the lid was designed so that it remained attached to the bottle and that, as a result, it was less likely to be lost in nature where it could be confused for food by birds and other wildlife. We also acknowledged that, for that reason, the cap may have been friendlier to the environment than other types of single-use plastic bottle caps. However, the cap was made from (non-recycled) plastic. We considered that the extraction of raw materials and subsequent processing of those materials in order to produce the plastic for the cap had a negative impact on the environment. Because we had not seen evidence for the full life cycle of the cap and because the cap was made from a material that was inherently harmful to the environment, we considered the claim “eco-friendly cap” overstated the environmental benefit of the cap and was therefore misleading. On that point, the ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation) and 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5 (Environmental claims). 4. Upheld The ad featured scenes of people drinking from bottles of Aqua Pura water whilst enjoying time outdoors in nature. At the same time a voice-over described the journey through nature that Aqua Pura water made and said, “… it’s nature friendly we assure you”. In that context we considered consumers would understand the claim “it’s nature friendly” to mean that the Aqua Pura brand as well as the advertised products were good for the environment. We considered this was also an absolute claim. We therefore expected to see evidence that demonstrated that the Aqua Pura brand and full life cycle of the products had a positive impact on the environment. We acknowledged that the plastic used in the bottles was made from 100% recycled PET, all components of the bottles were recyclable, and the bottles had an attached cap which reduced its chance of being littered. We understood that the bottles may therefore be less harmful to the environment than other single-use plastic bottles. We also noted that a scene in the ad showed a woman crushing an empty bottle after she had finished drinking from it, accompanied by the voice-over, “Crush it down, take it back, we’ll make plenty more with that”. We considered that this encouraged consumers to not litter their bottles, and instead, implied they should take them home where they could then be recycled. However, we understood that not all parts of the bottles were made from recycled plastic - the cap and label were made from “new” plastic. For the same reasons as referenced at Point 3, we considered that they would therefore have a negative impact on the environment. Because we had not seen evidence that demonstrated the Aqua Pura brand had a positive impact on the environment, nor had we seen evidence for the full life cycle of the products, and because parts of the products were made from a material that was inherently harmful to the environment, we considered the claim “nature friendly” overstated the environmental benefit of the brand and products and was therefore misleading. On that point, the ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation) and 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5 (Environmental claims)." ;

Roxane UK Ltd t/a Aqua Pura (Roxane) said the 500 ml still water bottle was made from 100% ‘Terrachim’, a recycled plastic. They had their own recycling plant where recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic was made and this was used to make 100% of the plastic in the 500ml sparkling water bottle. They provided reports that they said demonstrated this. The cap was made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic and the label was made from polypropylene (PP). They also confirmed that all components of the bottles were recyclable, and provided documentation in support. They said the ad made clear that it was only the bottle itself that was 100% recycled and recyclable. In their opinion, consumers would understand that the claim related only to the bottle itself and not to the cap and label. Clearcast said the ad made clear that it, and all the claims in the ad, related only to Aqua Pura’s 500 ml still and sparkling water products, rather than relating to the Aqua Pura brand more generally. The language used, together with visuals that showed the 500 ml bottles only, and on-screen text that said “*relates to 500ml bottle only”, made clear that the claims were only about the products shown in the ad. They provided a report from a recycling certification company, which confirmed that the bottles, along with their label and cap, were successfully processed at a recycling facility. 3. Roxane defined “eco-friendly” as “not harmful to the environment”. They said the cap met this definition because it was 100% recyclable and remained attached to the bottle so would not be lost in the environment where it could cause harm to wildlife. Clearcast said the “eco-friendly cap” was available on the 500 ml still and sparkling bottles only. As referenced above they believed viewers would understand from the ad that the claim related specifically to the 500 ml products shown in the ad. They said the eco-friendly cap was produced with less plastic than other bottle cap designs. The “eco-friendly cap” was a ‘flip to open, snap to close’ cap that remained attached to the bottle. Because it remained attached to the bottle it would not get lost in nature and therefore helped protect birds and wildlife that were unable to distinguish bottle caps from food. They provided the bottle label which explained the purpose of the eco-friendly cap. 4. Roxane defined “nature friendly” as a “sustainability and marketing term referring to goods and services, laws, guidelines and policies that claim reduced, minimal, or no harm upon ecosystems or the environment”. They said the advertised products were not harmful to the environment because all elements were 100% recyclable, and they were protecting wildlife with their attached cap. Clearcast said Aqua Pura had reduced the amount of plastic used in the 500 ml bottles and caps compared to previous ones. In their opinion, because the cap was attached to the bottle and would not be lost in nature, the bottle was made from 100% recycled material, and the bottle, cap and label were 100% recyclable, the claim “nature friendly” was not misleading." ;

The complainant had seen the ad on the FT website, and the ASA understood it had also appeared in the FT digital energy newsletter. It would therefore have been of interest to investors and those interested in purchasing Repsol’s products. We considered both audiences would have an awareness that many companies in carbon-intensive industries, including the oil and gas sector, were in the process of developing renewable alternatives to fossil fuels to help consumers dramatically reduce their emissions in response to the climate crisis. In addition, both groups were increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of activities related to higher-carbon products. They would be interested in seeking out businesses, including oil and gas companies, who were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services, including those developing alternative, synthetic fuels such as renewable hydrogen. However, we considered that consumers and many business readers were unlikely to be aware of the specific details of such technology – for example, that the development of renewable hydrogen was in its infancy and was not yet commercially available. The ad included several icons, including solar panels, an electric vehicle, a wind turbine, and a petrol pump with a leaf on it, which we considered would be understood by consumers as references to lower carbon energy sources. We considered both consumers and business readers were likely to understand the claim “Renewable hydrogen, another alternative to reduce emissions […] At Repsol, we are committed to renewable hydrogen as an energy source that offers up different uses such as zero net emissions synthetic fuel production” to mean that renewable hydrogen was an alternative to fossil fuels whose production and use could help to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and that lower carbon energy – of which renewable hydrogen was one such example – formed a significant proportion of Repsol’s overall energy production that was aimed at helping to achieve net zero emissions. We considered the icons depicting examples of other lower carbon energy sources strengthened that impression. We further considered that, in the absence of qualifying information, the cumulative effect of the claim relating to renewable hydrogen, in combination with the icons displayed in the ad, gave the impression that renewable energy products comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Repsol developed and sold, or were likely to develop or sell in the near future. We understood Repsol were in the process of transforming several of their industrial complexes to aid in the production of renewable hydrogen by 2030, and that extensive development and upscaling of the technology was needed before it existed in a commercial form. However, we also understood Repsol’s operations in the area would not commence until 2024, and that their development and production of renewable hydrogen was not yet in operation. We understood Repsol’s carbon emissions stood at 171 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2021 (50% of the emissions of the UK in 2021, 346.7 Mt CO2e), and they produced approximately 600,000 barrels of oil per day. They also had a substantial oil and gas exploration strategy, owning an interest in 40,660 acres (gross) of oil and gas development and exploration across Europe, Latin America, North America, Africa, and Asia and Oceania. We therefore understood that large-scale global oil and gas investment and exploration formed the vast majority of Repsol’s business interests. We considered the ad gave the overall impression that a significant proportion of Repsol’s business comprised lower carbon energy, such as renewable hydrogen, and therefore further information about the proportion of Repsol’s overall business model that comprised lower carbon energy was material information that should have been included. Because the ad did not include that information, we concluded it omitted material information and was likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading Advertising), and 11.1 (Environmental Claims)." ;

They were also committed to reducing their methane emissions by 85% to 0.2% by 2025. Their investments in low carbon energy made up a third of their total spending, and they aimed to have 45% of their total employed capital invested in the area by 2030. They were in the process of transforming their seven industrial complexes in Spain, Portugal and Peru into multi-energy hubs to aid in the production of renewable hydrogen by 2030. Energy consumption at those complexes had fallen by 20% between 2011 and 2022, equivalent to three metric tonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide (CO2). They also aimed to achieve net zero emissions across their business by 2050. They highlighted that extensive development and upscaling of new technology, such as renewable hydrogen, was needed before it existed in a commercial form. As such, the transition to renewable energy that used new or emerging technology could not always be expressed in ads in terms of existing production. Repsol said they were the largest operator in the Spanish electric vehicle (EV) charging network. They also developed and sold liquid fuels, gasoline and diesel, renewable biofuels, and natural gas for vehicles. They produced an average of 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which nearly 70% was gas. Their hydrocarbons production was focused on gas since that fuel helped electricity production in the transition from higher-emitting fuels such as coal. They also produced oil and petrochemical products such as plastics. Lighter, stronger plastics played an important part in manufacturing EVs since the batteries for those vehicles increased their overall weight. They envisaged that renewable hydrogen would be an effective way of producing and decarbonising fuels used in transport, such as gasoline and diesel. They highlighted that the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated that oil would still be needed in a decarbonised world. Repsol said that renewable hydrogen was one of the main alternative fuels needed for synthetic fuel production to foster a transition away from fossil fuels, which in turn would help to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Renewable hydrogen was a nascent industry of key importance to Europe, the UK and the US that required a large amount of investment. They explained that Repsol was a Spanish company with no relevant presence for consumers in the UK market. The ad had therefore been targeted at potential investors in the energy sector rather than the general public, and was aimed at increasing visibility of renewable hydrogen, and highlighting Repsol’s commitment to renewable hydrogen, rather than selling a specific product. The icons used in the ad displayed other alternative sources of energy, complementing the ad’s principal message. Additionally, the ad had been designed for inclusion in the Financial Times’ (FT) digital energy newsletter, sponsored by Repsol, which was aimed at an informed audience of users who subscribed to it specifically for energy sector-related news. Repsol said the format and medium of the ad, which was constrained by time and space, meant they had been unable to add more information about their general business activities. Clicking the ad took consumers to Repsol’s corporate website where they could find more information about those activities, and their environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting; the latter of which included information about their annual emissions and plans to reduce them. They said there was no obligation on them to describe the totality of their business activities in an ad and that the ad could not have misled consumers or investors into making a transactional decision that they would not have taken otherwise." ;

One scene showed a clip of a horse race, before showing a man in a café with several other people, looking away from them at something else in the distance, over the shoulder of one of them. A voice-over stated, “Come starter’s orders, I’m a bag of nerves.” The man’s leg was shaking, making the food and cutlery on the table shake. A woman said to him, “Really?”, capturing his attention briefly, before he turned away again." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "Upheld The CAP Code stated that ads must not portray, condone or encourage gambling behaviour that was socially irresponsible or could lead to financial, social or emotional harm. CAP’s Advertising Guidance on ‘Gambling advertising: responsibility and problem gambling’ made clear that ads which portrayed or otherwise referred to individuals displaying problem gambling behaviours or other behavioural indicators linked to problem gambling were likely to breach the Code. Marketers should take care to avoid an implication of such behaviours, for instance, outwardly light-hearted or humorous approaches that could be regarded as portrayals of those behaviours. Behaviours associated with people displaying or at risk from problem gambling included detachment from surroundings and preoccupation with gambling. We noted Clearcast’s view that the ad implied the man was watching a race on television, and we agreed that based on the scene and the simultaneous voice-over referring to ‘starter’s orders’, viewers were likely to interpret the ad as showing him watching the television as the race was about to begin. He was watching intently, and his shaking the table with his knee which, while clearly intended to be humorous, suggested he was preoccupied with the race while his food remained untouched. He was described as being a ‘bag of nerves’, which we considered viewers were likely to interpret was as a result of his having placed a bet on the race. It was clear that he was engrossed in the race to the extent that his companion had to point out his actions to bring his attention away from watching the television. We noted that, after responding to his companion, he appeared to turn away, though the shot was brief and he was looking down. We disagreed with Clearcast’s view that the man was never disconnected from his companion, or from the room, and considered viewers would assume from his behaviour that he was preoccupied with the outcome of the race in relation to a bet he had placed. We also considered that the man was obviously detached from his surroundings as he watched. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad depicted gambling behaviour that was socially irresponsible, and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code rules16.116.1Marketing communications for gambling must be socially responsible, with particular regard to the need to protect children, young persons and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or exploited.and16.3.116.3.1portray, condone or encourage gambling behaviour that is socially irresponsible or could lead to financial, social or emotional harm(Gambling)." ;

He was simply stating that he got nervous ahead of starter’s orders which would be his natural reaction whether or not he was gambling. They said the ad featured people in everyday situations, and characters continuing with life in normal day-to-day activities. The scene in question did not depict gambling. They said it showed the character waiting for the race to start and was not seen placing a bet. Nor did he mention having placed a bet. They argued that nerves before a sporting event were normal emotions. Ladbrokes said many people enjoyed gambling safely every week and the ad intended to convey that enjoyment, and to portray using the app as fun and entertaining. There was no indication that gambling was causing harm or distress for the character, but he was simply nervous before the start of a race and it was his nerves that were being highlighted as opposed to unhealthy gambling behaviour. The man was in a social environment with friends eating a meal waiting for a race to start. They believed he was not demonstrating any behaviour that could be considered socially irresponsible, and that a show of nerves could not be considered as such. Clearcast said the scene that was objected to, showed a man who had placed a bet on a horse race and was watching the televised race in a café, which was shortly to begin. He was showing excitement because the horse race was about to begin. They believed he was not detached from his surroundings but was focused on watching the race on television. Although the television was not shown, it was strongly implied that he was viewing a TV set because it followed the narrative of the ad that, most of the gamblers featured before him were also watching televised horse racing. Furthermore, this character’s excitement would not make sense if he was not watching the race build up on screen. Watching the build-up to the race led to anticipatory excitement which was shown in the edit by comical knee tapping. When his companion pointed out his plate of eggs were wobbling, he replied straight away, which showed he was neither preoccupied nor distant. He reacted immediately and was never disconnected nor detached from her or the room. He might have been shown to have an annoying habit and a fidget but he was not shown being harmfully obsessed with his bet. Channel Four said they did not believe the ad was socially irresponsible or could cause financial, social or emotional harm. They highlighted a number of approaches that would have been problematic for the ad to have taken, but did not believe the ad did so. While the section of the ad referred to above depicted a level of excitement, they believed it went no further than acknowledging that betting was a leisure activity involving an element of excitement which was reasonable to depict. The character’s exhibition of excitement was also challenged by his companion who said “really”, while giving a disapproving look." ;

This ACP is part of a set of 22 actions filed by the MPF following an investigation conducted under Civil Inquiry No. 1.13.000.001719/2015-49, concerning illegal deforestation within the Antimary Agroextractivist Settlement Project (PAE), but involving different defendants. The claims in the action are based, among other points, on Brazilian Environmental Law, particularly regarding the constitutional protection of the environment, allegations of deforestation, strict liability for environmental damages—including climate-related damages—and collective moral damages. The claim also cites, as environmental liabilities, unauthorized greenhouse gas emissions resulting from illegal deforestation, calculated at 59,509.13 tons of carbon dioxide. These emissions are directly tied to Brazil's deviation from its climate goals, conflicting with the country’s national and international commitments under the National Policy on Climate Change (Federal Law No. 12,187/2009) and the Paris Agreement." ;

Class I medical devices were generally CE-marked on a self-declaration basis. CE certification in itself did not constitute evidence for medical efficacy claims, and advertisers needed to ensure that they held evidence for such claims. We noted P&G’s argument that the references to “help” mitigated the impression that the product could definitely stop a cold. However, we still considered consumers would understand that to mean that the product had the effect of stopping cold symptoms. We further noted the prominence of the more absolute claims “IT WAS STOPPED, BEFORE IT TOOK HOLD” and “BLOCK THE VIRUS”, which preceded the claim “Help stop the cold”, and the references to trapping, neutralising and removing the cold virus. We considered that the ad as a whole was therefore likely to be interpreted by consumers to mean that the nasal spray went beyond reducing symptoms and could eliminate cold symptoms completely if used as soon as they emerged. A statement of opinion, from an expert on the common cold, reflected P&G’s views on consumer interpretation of the claims in the ad. It did not make any comment on the evidence provided. We considered the evidence submitted by P&G. That included a conference paper that referred to a number of studies, some of which were also provided in full, and the results of a consumer data survey. A double-blind and placebo-controlled trial, referenced in the summary document, but not provided in full, involved 70 healthy volunteers who had been inoculated with rhinovirus type 16 (RV-16) (a cold virus). In the Vicks First Defence Group, a smaller proportion of those infected with the virus developed a cold, while those who went onto develop cold symptoms experienced a greater reduction in symptoms on day three, when symptom severity was greatest, compared to the control group. We noted that the volunteers in the study had used the product 15 minutes after being inoculated with the virus. We considered that under ordinary circumstances, people who had caught the cold virus would not exhibit symptoms until later, usually one to three days after exposure to the virus, and would not use the product until they had experienced at least some symptoms. We therefore considered that the study was not relevant to demonstrating the product’s capability to treat cold symptoms after they had emerged. A randomised, parallel, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study enrolled 400 healthy volunteers, who were asked to use the product four times a day for seven days, upon experiencing the first signs of a common cold and to score common cold symptoms daily. The symptoms assessed were sore throat, runny nose, blocked nose, cough and tired or run-down feeling. We noted that the study showed some reduction in duration and severity in symptoms. The results, however, measured the average change in symptom severity across all symptoms over seven days, and we did not have information about the changes in relation to each individual symptom. Furthermore, the results did not demonstrate that the product could get rid of symptoms entirely, which was how consumers were likely to understand the ad. An in-vitro study used bacteria from human urinary tract infections and demonstrated that the bacteria were prevented from binding to human cells extracted from the mouth by HPMC, an ingredient in the product. We considered that while it may have provided useful support for the concept underpinning the product, namely that the HPMC in the product gave it binding properties, because it was not a human trial and used bacteria instead of the cold virus, it did not measure the effect of the product on actual cold symptoms. A randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blind cross-over study with 21 healthy volunteers, referred to in the summary document, but was not provided in full, examined the production of nasal fluid following administration of the product. Three minutes after the product and control had been administered, results showed that the mean weight of nasal fluid expelled was 328.43 milligrams by those who used the product and 40.48 milligrams by those in the control group. However, while we noted that the results could be useful for underpinning the mode of action by which the product was intended to work, they did not measure its effect on a range of cold symptoms after they had emerged. A cross-over clinical trial comprising 12 healthy volunteers, referenced in the summary document, but not provided in full, looked at the pH of the nose following administration of the product.. The results suggested that the low pH formula of the product could create a low pH environment in the nose. Another study used in-vitro solution tests by way of mixing the flu virus with animal cells and the product. The results showed that the flu virus was inactivated at a pH of 3.5. In an in vivo study conducted on ferrets, the product was applied five minutes after inoculation. Because these studies did not examine the product’s ability to treat cold symptoms in human subjects, we considered they were not, on their own, sufficient to substantiate the claims. A further study tested the effects of low-pH formulas on cold symptoms in humans. A total of 43 subjects completed the study, divided between those who used the product and those who were in the placebo group. The results showed that the spray did not reduce individual symptom scores or median daily symptom scores. We understood that the objective of the consumer data survey was to measure consumers’ recall of the ad, whether they linked the unbranded version of the ad to Vicks First Defence and their familiarity with the brand generally. There were 500 participants in the survey, of which 330 of them were purchasers of cough and cold relief products. All participants were presented with the question “Which of the following statements best describes the product shown?” followed by four options: “Prevents cold from fully forming”, “Treats all symptoms of a cold”, “Treats blocked nose” and “Prefer not to answer”; 68% of the cough and cold buyers and 64% of all respondents selected “Prevents colds from fully forming” and 17% of the 500 respondents selected “Treats all symptoms of a cold”. We considered that “Prevents cold from fully forming” was somewhat ambiguous and could be understood in different ways, including to mean that the product prevented a person from catching a cold or that it prevented cold symptoms from fully manifesting. Those meanings went beyond a statement that the product could reduce the duration and severity of symptoms. The survey was primarily designed to understand consumers’ association of the product with the Vicks brand, not their understanding of how it worked, and participants had been limited to a choice of four options. We therefore considered that the survey did not support P&G’s view that consumers would understand from the ad that the nasal spray could reduce the duration and severity of symptoms if used at the first signs of a cold. Having considered the body of evidence provided, we considered that the overall impression that consumers were likely to take from the ad, that is, that Vicks First Defence Nasal spray could eliminate cold symptoms completely if used when they first emerged, had not been substantiated. We concluded that the ad was misleading and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.and3.33.3Marketing communications must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information. They must not mislead by hiding material information or presenting it in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner.Material information is information that the consumer needs to make informed decisions in relation to a product.

The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation) and12.112.1Objective claims must be backed by evidence, if relevant consisting of trials conducted on people. Substantiation will be assessed on the basis of the available scientific knowledge.Medicinal or medical claims and indications may be made for a medicinal product that is licensed by the MHRA, VMD or under the auspices of the EMA, or for a CE-marked medical device.

They said that the claim “Help stop the cold” had a prominent place in the ad and “Helps stop a cold in its tracks” was in large lettering on the front of Vicks First Defence packaging. They considered these references to “help” were important because they implied that the product could assist in stopping the development of a full-blown cold but made no definite claims about its ability to do so. They said that they did not overstate the ability of their product or make any absolute claims on efficacy as this could not be supported by clinical data. They said that the claims “When used at the first signs of a cold” and “Helps stop a cold in its tracks” had been approved for use by the Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB) in August 2017, following a review of the in-vitro and in-vivo data in support of Vicks First Defence nasal spray. They also provided a statement of opinion on consumer interpretation of the claims from an expert. They said that the product had been marketed for more than a decade in the UK. They said that the product could be used for the prevention of a common cold and to treat the symptoms of cold and flu-like symptoms and that this was supported by double-blind, placebo-controlled human studies, results of which they provided. The evidence they provided contained analyses of five in-vivo human studies, two in-vitro studies and an in-vivo study using animals. They said that when used at the first signs of a cold, the product had three mechanisms which helped in its prevention and treatment. Firstly, they said that in-vitro experiments showed how the product reduced the adhesion of microorganisms to human cells and that their formula therefore trapped the virus. Secondly, they said that the low pH formula of the product neutralised or inactivated rhinoviruses and that this was demonstrated in a human cross-over study. Thirdly, they said that the product removed the virus by increasing the production of nasal fluid. They said that the product therefore had the ability to stop a cold from taking hold and could help to reduce symptoms when used at the first signs of a cold." ;

It is claimed that the coal used by the power plant contains a high concentration of radioactive elements, causing the atmosphere, climate, water, and soil degradation.

The Plaintiff argued that the defendant had drained and burned the peatland which caused fires inside the concession areas. The plaintiff also argued that the defendant failed to provide prevention tools to avoid fires in the concession. The MoEF then explained forestry regulations in Indonesia obliging every license holder to provide fires control measures—in which the defendant considered violating its obligations.

These damages comprise of ecological damage, damage to biodiversity and carbon release, and economic losses due to land degradation.

The report identifies three key communication strategies said to be being used by several companies that risk breaching advertising rules in the UK. These are:
1.	Advertising the use of fossil LNG as reducing emissions
2.	Advertising fossil LNG as environmentally friendly

The ad showed the price of the petrol which stopped at “£77.77” after which the man said “Yes”. The ad then featured a man who was ordering a sandwich.

It also stated advertisements must not portray gambling as indispensable or as taking priority in life; for example, over family, friends or professional or educational commitments. The ad presented three characters engaging in everyday tasks and real-life scenarios that appeared to remind them of different online casino games: a slot machine; blackjack game; and roulette wheel. The ASA considered that whilst the characters were depicted as momentarily reminded of gambling and engaged in that analogy of the situation, they were not so distracted that they didn’t continue with those tasks. We also considered that the brief scenarios depicted did not present gambling as indispensable or imply that it took priority in any aspect of the characters’ lives. We therefore concluded that the ad did not portray, condone or encourage gambling behaviour that was socially irresponsible, or portray gambling as indispensable or as taking priority in life.

They said the ad featured people in everyday situations designed to represent player behaviour in a fun parody of everyday life. The characters were shown in situations where humorous analogies were made with gambling but that those analogies did not suggest that gambling took precedence over the characters’ work or other daily activities. They said that at no point did the gambling comparisons interrupt their routines or stop them completing their ordinary tasks. There was no reference to gambling or any suggestion that the characters would rather be gambling than undertaking their usual tasks. Ladbrokes said the ad did not feature characters in a work environment and did not show them gambling, but that they were continuing in normal day to day activities. They did not believe the ad’s characters appeared to be addicted to gambling and they said each of the characters showed an expression of excitement and concentration, rather than glazed, distant or day-dreaming. They therefore believed none of the scenarios showed gambling, real or imagined, taking priority over actions. Ladbrokes said the characters were presented in a petrol station, a sandwich shop and a high street department store, which meant they were not portrayed in a glamourous way. Clearcast said that although the characters saw gambling analogies whilst out and about, these were not shown to get in the way of their lives and took no precedent. Clearcast believed the analogies were nothing more than humorous reminders of the mechanics and routines of gambling and gaming. Gambling did not appear to interrupt the character’s routines or errands, and although they may be temporarily reminded of gambling, this did not mean that gambling was either indispensable or that it was taking priority. They believed the clear priorities for the characters were filling their car with fuel, choosing sandwich fillings and browsing dresses. Clearcast believed all the characters looked alert and were concentrated on what they were doing. They said they were shown particularly engaged in each of their activities and that no one looked addicted to gambling." ;

The MPF alleges that the defendant's occupation of the land was unlawful, as the area is part of an Agroextractivist Settlement Project (PAE), which is federal property under the management of the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and is occupied by traditional extractivist communities. This ACP is one of 22 actions brought by the MPF following an investigation conducted under Civil Inquiry No. 1.13.000.001719/2015-49, addressing illegal deforestation within the Antimary Agroextractivist Settlement Project, though involving different defendants. The legal arguments for the action are based, among other elements, on Brazilian Environmental Law, emphasizing the constitutional protection of the environment, allegations of deforestation, civil liability propter rem for environmental damages (including climate-related damages), and collective moral damages. The MPF also highlights the environmental liability resulting from unauthorized greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by illegal deforestation, estimated at 161,016.06 tons of carbon dioxide. These emissions are directly linked to Brazil's deviation from its climate goals, violating commitments under the National Policy on Climate Change (Federal Law 12,187/2009) and the Paris Agreement." ;

                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1. Not upheld In the context of the heading “Innovating for a sustainable future” and the preceding sentence “Being part of Drax Group means you can have confidence in our energy supply, as well as our commitment to sustainability”, the ASA considered the claim “The majority of the electricity we supply comes from Drax – generated with responsibly-sourced, compressed wood pellets” would be interpreted as an indication that the majority of the electricity supplied by Haven Power was produced by Drax, and that this electricity was produced from wood pellets which were sourced in a sustainable way. We considered that advertisers should take particular care not to mislead when making absolute ‘green’ claims such as ‘sustainable’ which did not have one defined meaning, and in addition should base environmental claims on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the marketing communication stated otherwise. In this case, however we considered that the ROO laid out sustainability requirements around the use of biomass as a source of renewable energy, and therefore assessed whether the evidence provided by Haven Power demonstrated that they met those requirements. We understood the ROO included sustainability criteria which consisted of land and greenhouse gas emission criteria. The former focused on the land from which biomass was sourced, while the latter accounted for the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions of the biomass. We understood an energy producer which operated a Renewable Obligation Order accredited generating station had to report monthly information to Ofgem in order that they would be eligible for ROCs. That included providing information which confirmed the biomass they sourced to generate electricity met the sustainability criteria set out in legislation. ROCs were certificates issued to energy producers to demonstrate energy had come from a renewable source. We understood Drax was issued ROCs for the energy they generated from biomass. Once issued, we understood ROCs were sold by energy producers to energy suppliers such as Haven Power. Because of the sustainability criteria requirements of the Renewable Obligation Order, which had to be reported for ROCs to be issued, we considered that was also sufficient to demonstrate that the energy supplied was sourced sustainably. Haven Power provided us with information showing the ROCs they had purchased for the most recent reporting period, which corresponded to the electricity they had supplied. Because we considered Haven Power had demonstrated they had met the sustainability requirements set out in the Renewable Obligation Order, we concluded the claim “generated with responsibly-sourced, compressed wood pellets” was not misleading. On that point, we investigated the ad under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation),11.311.3Absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. Comparative claims such as \"greener\" or \"friendlier\" can be justified, for example, if the advertised product provides a total environmental benefit over that of the marketer's previous product or competitor products and the basis of the comparison is clear.and11.411.4Marketers must base environmental claims on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the marketing communication states otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle. If a general claim cannot be justified, a more limited claim about specific aspects of a product might be justifiable. Marketers must ensure claims that are based on only part of the advertised product's life cycle do not mislead consumers about the product's total environmental impact.(Environmental claims), but did not find it in breach. 2. Not upheld We understood Biofuelwatch’s challenge to the claim “it produces 86% less carbon than coal-generated energy” was based on concerns regarding the methodology which underpinned it. Specifically that, energy produced from the burning of biomass did not take into account its full environmental impact because only certain carbon emissions over the course of its life cycle were accounted for. However, we understood that this was consistent with the UK’s existing methodology for accounting for carbon emissions in the energy sector and we therefore considered it was legitimate for the claim to be made on that basis. We also understood that those who engaged with the ad were likely to be business users, either energy managers, specialist energy brokers or energy analysts. We therefore considered that much of its audience would have a specialist knowledge of the energy sector and were likely to understand the methodology which underpinned the claim. Because we understood that the claim aligned the established methodology and because the audience was likely to understand that the claim “it produces 86% less carbon than coal-generated energy” was based on that methodology, we considered it was unlikely to mislead. We investigated the ad under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),11.111.1The basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.and11.411.4Marketers must base environmental claims on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the marketing communication states otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle.

Haven Power Ltd said the Renewable Obligation Order (2015) (ROO) provided a definition of sustainably sourced biomass with which they complied. They said they had to demonstrate to UK regulators that they did not source from highly biodiverse land, high carbon stock land or land that was peat land. Haven Power provided information related to Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs), which they said were issued to operators of accredited renewable generating stations for the eligible renewable energy they generated. They said energy suppliers such as Haven Power used ROCs to demonstrate their renewable energy obligations set out in the ROO. They said that the Drax biomass power plant had been issued with ROCs for the energy they produced and provided information about the ROCs they procured for the most recent compliance period. They said they adhered to the UK Government criteria for sustainable biomass. Haven Power said the principles in that criteria were reflected in the sustainability requirements for woody biomass in the ROO, which stated that woody biomass was obtained from a sustainable source if it was grown within an area of forest or other land which was managed in a way that was consistent with the Forest Europe Sustainable Forest Management criteria. Haven Power said that in order to be eligible for the subsidies they received for generating biomass electricity in the UK, they had to evidence that they met the full sustainability requirements, which included limits on supply chain emissions and the sustainable forest management requirements. Compliance against these requirements was assessed annually through a third-party audit. Haven Power said that their parent company Drax had developed a rigorous process which ensured that new and existing biomass suppliers they used had to demonstrate that all sustainability and legal requirements were being met. Their eight key stages for ensuring compliance were: chain of custody; supplier audits; EU Timber Regulation legality assessment; greenhouse gas life cycle assessment and monitoring; the sustainability data return (SDR) captured in the contract; the SDR and annual declaration; regional and country risk assessments; and supplier relationship management and monitoring. Haven Power said the alternative process was for suppliers to evidence the necessary sustainability requirements through Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) certification. They said SBP-compliant material had been benchmarked by Ofgem to fully meet the UK sustainability requirements. Haven Power said that if a supplier could provide all their biomass to Drax with an SBP compliant biomass claim, Drax did not require an audit to be carried out. Haven Power said the Drax Power Station held chain of custody certification under three schemes: the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC); the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC); and the Sustainable Biomass Program. They said the chain of custody certification was used as a mechanism for tracking wood fibre from the forest to the final product and destination. Haven Power said that each supplier in the chain had to have a documented system so that wood fibre could be identified and traced. They said Drax required that all its suppliers achieved chain of custody certification, either through FSC or PEFC, before contracts were signed and pellets were delivered. Haven Power said that in addition to the Drax internal process and SBP certification, sustainability could further be demonstrated through Forest Management (FM) certification. That confirmed forest was managed in a way that preserved the natural ecosystem and benefited the lives of local people and workers, while it ensured economic viability was sustained. They said FM certification was difficult to achieve for some types of forest owners (for example where the owner only had a small area of land and FM certification was not economically possible), so an alternative level of assessment called Controlled Wood was available. That ensured that wood fibre was not: illegally harvested; harvested in violation of traditional and human rights; harvested in forests in which high conservation values are threatened by management activities; harvested in forests being converted to plantations or non-forest use; or from forests in which genetically modified trees were planted. Haven Power said that Ofgem guidance showed that FSC, PEFC and SBP all met the definition of sustainability under UK legislation. 2. Haven Power said the claim was based on the UK Government’s methodology. They said the combustion of biomass had long been considered low carbon because the carbon dioxide released was previously captured by the plants being combusted when they grew. The carbon was then reported on national inventories when the plants were harvested rather than when they were combusted. Haven Power said that was a central tenet of global carbon accounting and that various bodies agreed the use of biomass for power generation could be low carbon: the International Energy Agency; the EU Emissions Trading System; the Committee on Climate Change; and Ofgem. Haven Power did not believe the claim “it produces 86% less carbon than coal-generated energy” would be understood to mean that biomass produced 86% less carbon than coal at the point it was burned to generate energy. That was because the wording of the ad referred with equal prominence to the sourcing of biomass and because there was no reference to power stations, or burning fuel to generate energy. They also believed the reference to Drax indicated where the electricity was supplied from originally. Haven Power believed the ad would therefore be understood to mean that biomass produced 86% less carbon across its life cycle. Haven Power said the ad referred to a ‘Read More’ link, which directed users to further information about their carbon initiatives and which they said placed in greater detail the basis of the claim. For example, it stated “Throughout our operations” and included information on the full lifecycle of biomass production, power generation and electricity supply. Haven Power said that the website was directed solely at business users and that the vast majority of their customers transacted through third-party intermediaries, energy managers or energy brokers, who were experts and who would advise and procure energy supply contracts on their behalf. They said their remaining customers were large businesses that employed expert energy analysts and who would purchase energy from them directly. They therefore believed the ad’s audience was business users who would have an existing understanding of how biomass energy generation’s carbon impact was measured. Therefore, the audience would understand the claim “it produces 86% less carbon than coal-generated energy” was based on the entire lifecycle of the biomass." ;

The first featured an aerial image of waves crashing on a shore with text that stated \"Climate change doesn’t do borders. Neither do rising sea levels. That’s why HSBC is aiming to provide up to $1 trillion in financing and investment globally to help our clients transition to net zero”. The second poster featured an image of tree growth rings with text that stated \"Climate changes doesn’t do borders. So in the UK, we’re helping to plant 2 million trees which will lock in 1.25 million tonnes of carbon over their lifetime\".
The Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) received 45 complaints, including from Adfree Cities, who challenged whether the ads were misleading, because they omitted significant information about HSBC’s contribution to carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.
By ruling of October 19, 2022, the ASA upheld the complaints.
The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims be clear and that unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.
The ASA held that consumers would understand the ads to mean that HSBC was making, and intended to make, a positive overall environmental contribution as a company. As part of that contribution, consumers would understand that HSBC was committed to ensuring its business and lending model would help support businesses’ transition to models that supported net zero targets. Additionally, they would understand that HSBC were undertaking an environmentally beneficial activity by planting trees which would make a meaningful contribution towards the sequestration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Whilst the ads appeared in the run up to COP26, that did not mean consumers would understand the intricacies of transitioning to net zero. HSBC’s current financed emissions – emissions related to the customers it financed – stood at the equivalent of around 65.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year for oil and gas alone. That figure was likely to be much higher once other carbon-intensive industries such as power and utilities, construction, transport, and coal mining had been analysed and included. HSBC also intended to continue funding thermal coal mining and power production – a type of fuel that emitted high levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses – to some degree until 2040 (or 2030 in the OECD).
Some level of financing would be required for natural gas and oil production to 2050. However, that meant, despite the initiatives highlighted in the ads, that HSBC was continuing to significantly finance investments in businesses and industries that emitted notable levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. Consumers would not know that was the case, and it was therefore material information that was likely to affect consumers’ understanding of the ads’ overall message, and so should have been made clear in the ads. The ads omitted this material information and were therefore misleading.
The ASA ruled that the ads must not appear again in the form complained of. The ASA told HSBC to ensure that future marketing communications featuring environmental claims were adequately qualified and did not omit material information about its contribution to carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.""" ;

The investigation on Volkswagen was trigged by consumer associations' allegations of false declarations made by Volkswagen when marketing its EA 189 diesel vehicles in relation to (i) the level of polluting emissions of such vehicles (Volkswagen were accused to have installed the so-called defeat device to falsify the result of the emission tests) and to (ii) their specific green features.

Gambling ads could not therefore appeal more strongly to under-18s than they did to over-18s. The ASA understood that the ad was not seen in an age-gated environment and outside of that environment Gala Spins had taken steps to target the ad only at those between 18 and 65 years of age. However, we understood that targeting of the ad was based on an audience which had self-reported their age and where there were otherwise no prohibitions on under-18s. Therefore, the steps taken could not ensure that under-18s, who falsely reported their age, were not exposed to the ad. We therefore considered whether it complied with the Code’s requirement that gambling ads must not be of particular appeal to children. We considered that the cartoon-like imagery of five stuffed toy animals was likely to appeal to under-18s. We considered the game’s name “Fluffy Favourites”, and the ad’s caption “IT’S A ROLLERCOASTER OF CUTENESS!”, were likely to strengthen that appeal. We considered that those factors combined to give the ad a child-like theme. For those reasons, we considered that the ad was likely to be of particular appeal to under-18s, and therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules16.116.1Marketing communications for gambling must be socially responsible, with particular regard to the need to protect children, young persons and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or exploited.and16.3.1216.3.12be likely to be of particular appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture(Gambling)." ;

The MPF alleges that the defendant's occupation of the land was illegal because it was part of an Agro-Extractivist Settlement Project (PAE), owned and managed by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and occupied by traditional extractivist communities. This ACP is part of a set of 22 lawsuits filed by the MPF as a result of the investigation carried out in Civil Inquiry No. 1.13.000.001719/2015-49 into illegal deforestation carried out inside the Antimary Agro-Extractivist Settlement Project (PAE), but against different defendants. The lawsuit is based, among other things, on Brazilian environmental law, concerning the constitutional protection of the environment, the accusation of deforestation, propter rem civil liability for environmental damage, including climate damage, and collective moral damages. It also mentions the unauthorized emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) caused by the illegal deforestation of the area, calculated at 6,497.48 tons of carbon dioxide and which are directly related to the Brazilian State's departure from its climate goals, out of step with national and international commitments made by Brazil in the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009) and in the Paris Agreement (promulgated by Federal Decree 9.073/2017).

We therefore expected to see a high level of evidence which demonstrated how Air France were protecting the environment and making aviation sustainable. We understood that air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. We also understood that there were currently no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry that would adequately substantiate absolute green claims, such as that Air France were “committed to protecting the environment” and helped people “travel better and sustainably”, as we considered consumers would interpret them in this context.In the absence of any evidence demonstrating that Air France were protecting the environment and making aviation sustainable, we concluded that the claims gave consumers a misleading impression of the impact that travelling with Air France would have on the environment.

We considered consumers would understand the claims “HSBC is aiming to provide up to $1 trillion in financing and investment globally to help our clients transition to net zero” in ad (a), and “we’re helping to plant 2 million trees which will lock in 1.25 million tonnes of carbon in their lifetime” in ad (b) to mean that HSBC was making, and intended to make, a positive overall environmental contribution as a company. As part of that contribution, we considered consumers would understand that HSBC was committed to ensuring its business and lending model would help support businesses’ transition to models that supported net zero targets. Additionally, they would understand that HSBC were undertaking an environmentally beneficial activity by planting trees which would make a meaningful contribution towards the sequestration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We considered that the use of imagery from the natural world, and in particular ad (a)’s image of waves crashing on a beach, contributed to that impression. The ads appeared on high streets in October 2021, in the run up to COP26, and we acknowledged HSBC’s comments that COP26 had received widespread national media coverage around the time the ads were on display. However, we did not consider that meant that consumers would understand the intricacies of transitioning to net zero, and would not expect that HSBC, in making unqualified claims about its environmentally beneficial work, would also be simultaneously involved in the financing of businesses which made significant contributions to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and would continue to do so for many years into the future.HSBC’s commitment to invest $1 trillion globally to help its clients transition to net zero in 2020 formed one of the main strands in its 2021 Group Annual Report and Accounts (the Annual Report). The Annual Report indicated that HSBC intended to invest between $750 billion and $1 trillion in helping its clients transitioning to net zero. However, it also indicated that its current financed emissions – emissions related to the customers it financed – stood at the equivalent of around 65.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year for oil and gas alone based on the information available at the time the report had been prepared. We understood that figure was likely to be much higher once other carbon-intensive industries such as power and utilities, construction, transport, and coal mining had been analysed and included. We also understood from the Annual Report that HSBC intended to continue funding thermal coal mining and power production – a type of fuel that emitted high levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses – to some degree until 2040 (or 2030 in the OECD). We acknowledged HSBC’s comments concerning the level of natural gas and oil production required in 2050, as stated by the IEA, and understood that some level of financing would be required for those activities. However, notwithstanding the reasons given for the continued financing of those industries, we considered that meant, despite the initiatives highlighted in the ads, that HSBC was continuing to significantly finance investments in businesses and industries that emitted notable levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. We did not consider consumers would know that was the case, and we therefore considered it was material information that was likely to affect consumers’ understanding of the ads’ overall message, and so should have been made clear in the ads. We concluded that the ads omitted material information and were therefore misleading. Ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.3.33.3Marketing communications must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information. They must not mislead by hiding material information or presenting it in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner.Material information is information that the consumer needs to make informed decisions in relation to a product.

They explained the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Sixth Assessment Report stated that to avoid the most significant effects of climate change, and in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C, global greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030, and net-zero emissions must be achieved by 2050. The United Nations (UN) was also encouraging countries to set short-term interim 2030 targets ahead of 2050. A report by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) outlined that financial institutions needed to align financing with a 1.5°C net zero by 2050 pathway and set interim 2030 targets, and HSBC said their Climate Strategy was consistent with those aims, including their 2030 financed emissions reduction targets for high-emitting sectors. They explained that their policies for phasing-down fossil fuel financing were also aligned with the approach recommended by the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The GFANZ had a number of membership criteria, including setting 2030 interim targets for decarbonisation, taking immediate action to begin decarbonisation, setting and publishing a net zero strategy, and adhering to strict restrictions on the use of offsets. HSBC said that the financing of greenhouse gas-emitting industries was required during the transition to net zero, and so their continued financing of those industries was not in conflict with the aims of a transition to net zero. They highlighted that the IEA’s 2021 report on net zero by 2050 outlined that at that stage the world would still need 20% of current natural gas production, and 25% of current oil production. Fossil fuels would play a critical role in a secure energy transition up to 2050 and would require financing. HSBC preferred a phase-down and industry engagement rather than divestment, an approach that had been drawn from the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investment. The SBTi had also recommended engagement with fossil fuel companies to adopt net zero targets and action plans, with divestment as a final resort for companies that were unable, or unwilling, to provide a credible transition pathway by 2040. As a business, they targeted a 34% reduction in absolute oil and gas financed emissions, and a 75% reduction in financed emissions intensity for the power and utilities sector by 2030. In 2022 they would extend their financed emissions analysis and targets to coal mining, aluminium, cement, iron and steel, and transport, and in 2023 they planned to report on the agriculture, commercial and real estate sectors. They planned to phase-out their financing of thermal coal by 2030 in the European Union and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, and by 2040 in the rest of the world. They said that aim was consistent with the IEA’s report and the UN’s guidance in the area. With reference to the claim in ad (b), HSBC had entered into a four-year partnership with the National Trust, worth £4 million, to create 2,000 hectares of carbon-rich woodland. Under that partnership it endeavoured to plant two million trees by 2025, which according to the Woodland Carbon Code, and based on the average 100-year lifespan of a tree, would lock in 1.25 million tonnes of carbon. The trees would be at various sites, and 90,000 had already been planted since the partnership’s inception. HSBC believed the claims in ads (a) and (b) highlighted two tangible and specific short-to-medium term initiatives, capable of quantifiable measurement, and would not be seen as commenting, in a broader sense, on their green credentials or environmental contribution. Furthermore, the ads had appeared in the run up to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), which they believed would have affected how the average consumer understood the claims made. Not least because there was a period of heightened media and corporate engagement on climate change leading up to, and during, the Conference, attended by debate about the role of banks in combatting climate change. The ads therefore did not mislead about HSBC’s total environmental impact and invited consumers to find out more about the initiatives through a call to action - “Search HSBC Sustainability”. They said that consumers who searched for those terms on the Internet would find a link to a page on HSBC’s website where they could access a detailed summary of climate change initiatives which had been, and would be, introduced by HSBC. Consumers could further access HSBC’s Climate Strategy on that same website." ;

Additionally, on your behalf, Golden Leaves funeral plans will even contribute to an environmental fund that combats climate change for the benefit of future generations.” A page titled “Eco-Coffin Range Green Funerals UK Golden Leaves Funeral Plan” included the text “Explore our selection of coffins to include in an eco-friendly funeral in the UK”. Below that, the ad included an image of a coffin and the text “Glade Veneer – Our Glade Funeral Plan comes with a classic style veneered coffin. This traditional coffin is made using FSC-certified Ecologique board, oak veneer style wood finished with water-based polish. Manufactured by J C Atkinson, the UK’s premier eco-friendly coffin manufacturer, you are assured that you are purchasing quality green coffins.”" ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1. Upheld The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information. The Code also required that absolute claims be supported by a high level of substantiation, and that marketers base environmental claims on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the marketing communication stated otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle. The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claims ““Explore our selection of coffins to include in an eco-friendly funeral in the UK” and “Manufactured by J C Atkinson, the UK’s premier eco-friendly coffin manufacturer, you are assured that you are purchasing quality green coffins” to mean that the coffins that they were buying would have either no impact or an overall beneficial impact on the environment. Because the claims were unqualified, we considered that consumers would understand them to be absolute claims about the total environmental benefit specifically of the coffins, over their full life cycle including burial or cremation. The life cycle analysis assessed the cremation impact and particulate emissions of a range of coffins when burned. It also assessed the total impact of the manufacture and distribution of different types of coffin. The life cycle analysis did contain information about which kinds of coffin might have a lower impact than others, however, it did not state that any type of burial or cremation would have a neutral or positive environmental benefit. Because the evidence that had been provided to us did not demonstrate that there was no negative impact on the environment over the full life cycle of the coffins, we concluded that the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation),11.111.1The basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.11.311.3Absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. Comparative claims such as \"greener\" or \"friendlier\" can be justified, for example, if the advertised product provides a total environmental benefit over that of the marketer's previous product or competitor products and the basis of the comparison is clear.and11.411.4Marketers must base environmental claims on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the marketing communication states otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle. If a general claim cannot be justified, a more limited claim about specific aspects of a product might be justifiable. Marketers must ensure claims that are based on only part of the advertised product's life cycle do not mislead consumers about the product's total environmental impact.(Environmental claims). 2. Upheld The claim “How can I have a Green funeral” appeared alongside “Choosing an environmentally-friendly funeral […] makes a positive statement of intent to help preserve the world in which we live”. The page stated that the funeral plans offered would “minimise the funeral’s impact on the environment” and described the ways in which that would happen including that “The entire carbon footprint of a funeral service may be offset by tree planting in conservation areas or by donating funds to preserve endangered rainforests”. The page clarified “Woodland Conservation” and “Supporting the Rainforest” to mean that “a sapling will be donated for planting in woodland” and “you may sponsor a tree in a rainforest which needs protection from commercial exploitation” respectively. The page also detailed other ways in which their funeral plans provided environmental benefits including “a selection of eco-coffins” and the option to buy into a fund that “helps fund the installation of energy efficient measures into the homes of the elderly and those most in need”. We considered that consumers would understand from the page, taken as a whole, that the claim “Green funeral” would mean that all apects of the funeral and its life cycle would have a neutral or positive effect on the environment. Whilst we acknowledged that the page said that the plans were designed to “minimise the funeral’s impact on the environment”, we considered that claims such as “the entire carbon footprint […] maybe offset” and “an environmentally-friendly funeral” which “makes a positive statement of intent to help preserve the world in which we live” would be understood to mean that choosing the plans would result in an overall neutral or positive environmental impact. We therefore needed to see evidence that all aspects of all funerals covered by the plans including manufacture, delivery, transport, burial, cremation, memorial service and other parts of the whole life cycle of the funeral would have no negative impact on the environment. We understood that the plans offered included carbon offsetting or conservation options to ensure that the carbon emissions involved in the funeral were offset elsewhere. We were, however, neither provided with evidence as to how that was calculated to cover the whole life cycle of the funeral nor whether such schemes were credible. We considered that, in order to demonstrate the absolute claim that the funeral was “green” or “eco-friendly”, we needed the evidence to demonstrate that the funeral would have no negative impact on the environment. We acknowledged that some of the money paid by consumers into a fund which was claimed to invest ethically into companies and funds that benefitted the environment. However, it was not clear from the literature that had been provided to us, to what extent that justified the funeral plans claiming they were environmentally friendly. Because we considered that consumers would understand the terms “green” and “environmentally-friendly” in the context of the ad to be absolute claims about the whole life cycle of the funeral, and because the evidence did not support that purchasing a funeral plan from Golden Leaves would have a net neutral or positive impact on the environment, we concluded that the claims had not been substantiated and were misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

They said that the environmental impact of the coffin should be assessed alongside the whole plan which included tree planting and conservation donations which would help to offset the carbon emissions of the funeral.

DUH argues that by failing to do so, the automaker is violating the fundamental right to climate protection and impinging upon the rights and freedoms of future generations, as phase out would be necessary for the company to adhere to its allocated carbon budget. The claim is grounded in the Paris Agreement and German Tort Law.

The defendant is a cattle raiser and has been fined several times by the environmental agency for illegal deforestation of a total of 5,600 hectares in the state of Amazonas, using fire. It is argued that his illegal activities have an impact on the biomass of the Amazon, illegally interfering with the forest's carbon stock and emitting greenhouse gases (GHG), intensifying the climate crisis. It is argued that climate damage is projected continuously and addresses residual environmental damage in climate matters, which corresponds to the set of effects and imbalances that cannot be remedied. The climate damage also implies intergenerational environmental damage, since it spreads indefinitely, causing future damage. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's conduct was held under violation of the Paris Agreement and that the international obligations internalized by Brazil are binding for the Judicial Branch, implying the determination of reparability of environmental climate damage. It presents a means of quantifying climate damage based on studies by the CADAF Project (Carbon Dynamics of Amazonian Forest), representing 160.34 tons of carbon emitted per deforested hectare; on a study developed by the Center for Management and Strategic Studies: \"REDD in Brazil: an Amazonian approach\", setting 161 tons of carbon per hectare; and on the social cost of carbon (SCC), arguing that there is a direct proportion between the number of hectares deforested and the generation of carbon, in line with the parameters set by the Amazon Fund. Therefore, the plaintiff argues that climate damage can be identified on an individual scale by multiplying the estimated GHG emissions from the activity (5,600 hectares multiplied by 161 tons emitted per hectare) by the SCC (based on the cost calculated by the OECD of 60 euros per ton). Thus, the deforestation generated the illegal emission of 901,600 tons of carbon, resulting in the obligation to pay the amount of R$292,118,400.00. As a preliminary injunction, it is requested that (i) the litigious nature of the property which is the subject of the action be recognized; (ii) the defendant be ordered not to transfer the occupation of the area to third parties; (iii) the defendant be prohibited from leasing or lending chainsaws and other deforestation tools; (iv) the defendant be prohibited from selling or donating oxen or agricultural products; (v) the blocking or unavailability of assets in the equivalent amount of R$292,118,400.00; (vi) the suspension or restriction of the defendant's access to tax benefits and credit lines; (vii) the defendant be ordered to implement carbon sinks. On the merits, the plaintiff claims that the defendant be condemned to (i) repair the environmental climate damage in ecological compensation; (ii) repair the interim climate damage; (iii) promote ecological compensation; (iv) promote financial compensation for illegal greenhouse gas emissions, with the amount of R$292,118,400.00 being reverted to the National Climate Change Fund; (v) promoting financial compensation to be set by the court for the amounts to be reverted to funds for preventing and responding to climate disasters; (vi) compensating the amount related to the disgorgement of profits; and (vii) confirming the requests made as a matter of urgency." ;

The TV ad, seen in September and October 2022, featured a girl who said “Right now Anglian Water is creating wetlands to clean water using nature and make homes for wildlife. By building a really long pipe to bring water to places that need it most, while protecting nature too. And huge tanks to collect rain so there’s less chance of floods in the future. In fact, everything they do today is for tomorrow …” A male voice-over said, “Never still, never stop. Anglian Water.

The ads stated “Right now Anglian Water is creating wetlands to clean water using nature and make homes for wildlife. By building a really long pipe to bring water to places that need it most, while protecting nature too. And huge tanks to collect rain so there’s less chance of floods in the future. In fact, everything they do today is for tomorrow”. We considered that the overall impression of the ad was that Anglian Water was making, and intended to make, a positive overall environmental contribution as a company. As part of that contribution, they were increasing their pipe network, cleaning water using nature and installing tanks to collect storm water, which would have positive benefits for wildlife and nature. We considered that the voice-over, which stated, “In fact, everything they do today is for tomorrow” and the visuals used in the ads, which included various clips of green spaces, trees and wildlife, contributed to that impression. The complainants were concerned because they understood that Anglian Water had a history of dumping sewage into rivers and the sea, had killed fish and wildlife as a result, and had been fined because of those actions. All water companies had licences and permits that they were required to comply with to reduce their impact and protect the water environment. The Environment Agency stated that storm overflows were a necessary part of the current sewerage system. Water companies discharged storm sewage (wastewater diluted with rainwater) to rivers or seas during periods of heavy or prolonged rainfall to prevent storm sewage backing up into homes and streets. If they operated within those circumstances and were compliant with their permit, they were not reported and recorded as pollution incidents. Furthermore, water companies were monitored for their compliance with their permits to discharge treated water from sewage treatment works and water treatment works. In 2021, which we understood was the most recent year for which data was available, Anglian Water had an overall Environmental Performance Assessment (EPA) rating of two stars (out of a possible four), which meant that the ‘company requires improvement’. The EPA report stated that they performed below target (amber status) for the number of sewerage pollution incidents and for their compliance with their discharge permit. Their performance was significantly below target (red status) for the number of serious pollution incidents. Furthermore, Anglian Water had had enforcement action against them on multiple occasions in recent years for Environmental Permitting Regulations (EPR) offences. We accepted that Anglian Water were carrying out a number of activities that could have a positive impact on the environment. However, because they also carried out activities that caused harm to the environment, which contradicted the overall impression of the ad, we considered that was material information which should have been made clear in the ads. We concluded that the ads omitted material information and were therefore misleading.

They felt it was their obligation to elicit customer support for the changes Anglian Water wanted to see in their region, for example, helping customers save water and avoid sewer abuse. They did not believe that the ads were misleading. The ads included a number of initiatives that showed where Anglian Water were investing in environmental protection and improvement for the long term. The ads were part of a wider, multi-media and multi-channel campaign which explained each initiative and presented a more complete picture of the impact Anglian Water had on the environment, and how they were taking steps to reduce it where it may have been detrimental. The campaign also included addressing criticism aimed at both Anglian Water and the industry more generally regarding perceptions of environmental performance. They worked within the parameters, and often exceeded the expectations, of those who regulated the industry, including the Environment Agency, the Drinking Water Inspectorate, Natural England, the Water Services Regulation Authority (OFWAT) and the Consumer Council for Water. They provided links to a number of their press releases and pages on their website that they said substantiated the initiatives referenced in the ads. They believed that they had an overwhelmingly positive impact on the environment when all their activities were taken into account and they did not believe that any significant information had been omitted from the campaign, of which the ads were a part. They acknowledged that there had been active public debates about legacy assets such as combined storm overflows (CSOs), but said that they did not construct these anymore. The work that they did on CSOs was targeted at either removing them or reducing the frequency that they were used. They were sympathetic to the suggestion that CSOs were not an appropriate way to handle the increasingly intense rainfall that was experienced as a consequence of climate change, however, they were just one of the reasons why rivers fell short of the Environment Agency’s ‘Good Ecological Status’. CSOs accounted for only around 4% of the reasons rivers failed to meet this status nationally, and less than 1% of the reasons in the Anglian Water region. It was incorrect for media coverage to conclude that use of CSOs would always result in environmental harm, was always illegal, or was something the company actively sought to do. Anglian Water did not actively dump sewage into rivers and seas. Large tracts of the existing sewage network carried both surface water (e.g., rainwater) and wastewater (e.g., from homes and businesses) to Anglian Water recycling centres before it was cleaned and returned to the environment. Where exceptional storm events occurred, which could overwhelm the network, to avoid homes flooding the discharges to the environment compromised highly diluted sewage. This had a negligible environmental impact on the receiving watercourse and was permitted by the Environmental Agency. Sewers had not been built like this for years, since well before Anglian Water came into existence when the water industry was privatised in 1989. Since then, Anglian Water had acted to reduce the number of CSOs and the frequency they operated. However, until they could be eradicated, they acted as a necessary safety valve in old sewerage systems to protect homes and businesses from flooding during heavy rainfall. As there would be no future for the region or for those who lived and worked there without a sustainable supply of water and a healthy environment, they believed it was true to say that all the work they were actively engaged in was to secure a more prosperous future for the region. Clearcast endorsed Anglian Water’s comments. They ensured that they had evidence for all the claims made regarding the improvements and structures Anglian Water were putting in place, including how they would prove to be a benefit. They were satisfied that Anglian Water’s plan of action would help in the future. They believed that the claim “everything they do today is for tomorrow” was referencing the initiatives that were discussed within the advert, and that those were very obviously pointed out. Referring to a news article that discussed Anglian Water’s river sewage discharges, Clearcast said that it was not relevant to the ads because they were clearly about Anglian Water’s future aims and the initiatives they were putting in place to help make the service better. They provided copies of a number of press releases and pages on the Anglian Water website that they believed substantiated the initiates referenced in the ad." ;

                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1. Upheld The ASA welcomed Perfectly Green’s assurance that future marketing communications for the product would not use the name “Eco-grass”, or claim that it was environmentally friendly. We considered that consumers would understand the claim that Soul Eco-grass was recyclable to mean that the product was easily recyclable once it had reached the end of its life cycle. We considered that consumers would expect that recycling process to be available to UK consumers. We consulted the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on the matter of the recycling of PE and PP materials. We understood from Defra that plastics usually needed to be separated into their specific “families” (PE, PP etc.) prior to any reprocessing, because mixed materials gave poorer quality recyclate. We also understood that Defra did not believe that, at the time of the complaint, the UK had the necessary infrastructure to carry out that recycling process, nor were they aware of recycling locations which could do so. We noted that this understanding was echoed by Perfectly Green’s own response, that UK consumers did not yet have widespread access to recycling plants suitable for the product. Perfectly Green provided links to a short online news article published by Metropolis, a design and architecture magazine, which referred to the sustainability and recyclability of PP and a link to a blog post by a polymer testing laboratory based in the USA, titled “Polyolefins are Everywhere!”, which described common uses for different types of plastics, and said that they were considered non-toxic. We did not consider that either article was relevant to the issue raised in the complaint. While we acknowledged that PP might be recyclable under the right circumstances, that fact did not address the complications posed to the recycling process by a product made up of both PP and PE, nor did it negate the lack of infrastructure in the UK which could carry out such recycling. We also did not consider that either polyolefins prevalence or potential lack of toxicity was relevant to the issue of whether Soul Eco-grass could be recycled. Perfectly Green also provided links to an online article discussing the future of the sustainability and recycling of artificial turf, published on the Synthetic Turf Councils’ website, and a Netherlands-based website for a Dutch company responsible for building the first circular processing facility for artificial grass. We did not consider that articles discussing the potential future of the industry, or which highlighted the steps taken in the Netherlands to address the problem of recycling artificial grass, were relevant to the issue of how Eco Soul-grass would be recycled in the UK at the time of the complaint. In the absence of any qualifications noting the difficulties posed to the recycling of the product due to its mixed composition, and the lack of existing UK infrastructure to process it once it had reached the end of its life cycle, we concluded that the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),11.111.1The basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.and11.411.4Marketers must base environmental claims on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the marketing communication states otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle. If a general claim cannot be justified, a more limited claim about specific aspects of a product might be justifiable. Marketers must ensure claims that are based on only part of the advertised product's life cycle do not mislead consumers about the product's total environmental impact.(Environmental claims). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear, and stated that unqualified claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. It also stated that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise, and required that marketing communications did not mislead consumers about the product's total environmental impact. The Code also required that absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. The ASA considered that the inclusion of the word “eco” in the name of the product implied that it was “eco-friendly”, and that the ad contained no qualifications or further information about the basis for that. We considered that the overall wording of the ad, which portrayed the product in a positive environmental light, together with the use of “eco” in the product name, and the inclusion of the recycle symbol and thumbs up emojis, meant that consumers would understand that the product was “eco-friendly”. We considered that claims that products were “eco-friendly” were absolute, and in the absence of further context or qualification, would be understood to mean that the advertised product was not harmful to the environment in any way, throughout its full life cycle. We therefore expected to see evidence which demonstrated that Soul Eco-grass caused no environmental damage over its full life cycle. We acknowledged Perfectly Green’s comments that they believed the lack of watering, or need for upkeep with potentially chemical-based products or lawnmowers, meant that the product was environmentally friendly. However, because the extraction of raw materials and subsequent processing of those materials in order to produce artificial grass had a negative impact on the environment, we did not consider that the product had a positive environmental impact across its full life cycle. We also did not consider that the potential uses of the product highlighted by Perfectly Green were relevant to the environmental impact it had, and considered that in some circumstances the product would be used to replace real grass, thereby having a detrimental impact on biodiversity. Because we considered that the ad would be understood by consumers to mean that Soul Eco-grass was environmentally friendly, and because we had seen no evidence regarding the environmental impact over the course of the full life cycle of the product, we concluded that the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),11.111.1The basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.11.311.3Absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. Comparative claims such as \"greener\" or \"friendlier\" can be justified, for example, if the advertised product provides a total environmental benefit over that of the marketer's previous product or competitor products and the basis of the comparison is clear.and11.411.4Marketers must base environmental claims on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the marketing communication states otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle. If a general claim cannot be justified, a more limited claim about specific aspects of a product might be justifiable. Marketers must ensure claims that are based on only part of the advertised product's life cycle do not mislead consumers about the product's total environmental impact.(Environmental claims)." ;

Perfectly Green Ltd said that Soul Eco-grass was manufactured from materials that belonged to the polyolefin family of polymers, namely polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). They understood that polyolefins could be recycled by pyrolysis (cracking) or gasification, and that their chemical composition and structure made them a potentially useful source of hydrocarbons or carbon atoms. They provided links to two online news articles, an online blog post, and a link to a website which they believed supported the claims made regarding the recyclability of the product. Perfectly Green said they believed that as the backing of the product was made of PP, and did not include conventional artificial grass backings such as latex or polyurethane, potential recycling of the product would not face the complications associated with artificial grasses which used non-polypropylene-based backings. Perfectly Green also said that the producer of the product had informed them that they believed PE and PP plastics did not need to be separated when recycled. Perfectly Green said they acknowledged that consumers did not yet have widespread access to recycling plants suitable for the product, because such sites were at the early stages of development in the UK, but that they expected facilities to be available in the future. They said it was their understanding that the product was, nonetheless, fully recyclable. 2. Perfectly Green said that they believed the technical specification of the product as outlined above meant that they were entitled to name it “Eco-grass”.Regarding the perceived environmental damage caused by artificial grass, they said that it was sometimes used as an alternative to concrete, decking, patio slabs or other artificial and/or manufactured surfaces. They said that artificial grass could be an option for homeowners whose lawns could not be maintained due to issues such as lack of sunlight, the presence of lawn pests, or due to old age or disability. They also pointed out its use as a safety surface in playgrounds, and its ability to create ‘green spaces’ in locations such as roof gardens and balconies. Perfectly Green also said they believed that the product was environmentally friendly because it did not need to be watered, did not require upkeep with chemical-based products such as pesticides, herbicides, or fertilisers, and did not need to be mowed. They did, however, inform the ASA that they would remove the words “Eco-grass” from the name of the product, and that no future marketing communications for the product would contain that name, or claims which implied that the product was environmentally friendly." ;

Copper Clothing have created a face mask that does just this. […] Copper Clothing’s copper-infused face mask destroys 99.99% of COVID-19 in a matter of minutes.”" ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "Upheld The ad stated “Copper Clothing’s copper-infused face mask destroys 99.99% of COVID-19 in a matter of minutes”. We considered that listeners were likely to understand the claim to mean that the Copper Clothing face mask could rapidly kill COVID-19 particles that it came into contact with and would protect the wearer from contracting the virus. While the statement “a matter of minutes” was ambiguous, we considered listeners would understand that the active element of a face covering intended to provide protection via biocidal means would take effect with a high level of efficacy very shortly after contact, if not instantly. We sought advice from the Health & Safety Executive (HSE).The product contained copper with the intention of destroying a harmful organism by means other than mere physical or mechanical action. We understood that the active substance in the product - copper sulphate pentahydrate - was approved for use in the category of biocidal products into which the product fell. That meant that biocidal products containing it needed to be authorised before they could be supplied and used. Copper Clothing’s face masks were not authorised (by HSE) and so we understood it was unlikely they were legally on the market at the time the ad was seen. That notwithstanding, it was relevant to consider the evidence provided. We referred to the Efficacy Guidance provided by the European Chemicals Agency for Biocidal products, which outlined various forms of data that might be expected to determine the efficacy of a biocidal product. The guidance recommended at least a log-4 (99.99%) reduction to show efficacy against viruses, and required comparisons with untreated control samples and an environment representative of real life conditions of use. In order to substantiate the efficacy claims, we therefore expected to see methodologically-sound evidence that reflected how the product was likely to be used in real life. When measuring the reduction of very large numbers of pathogens, even small changes in the percentage figure represented significant changes in the degree of reduction. For example, the 99.99% reduction required by the standard meant a 10,000 times decrease (log 4) whereas a 99% reduction would represent a 100 times decrease (log 2).Copper Clothing Ltd provided two studies in relation to bovine coronavirus, studies in relation to other viruses and general studies which examined copper-impregnated products. However, they did not relate to the Copper Clothing face mask itself or COVID-19 specifically. Copper Clothing Ltd provided two reports which referenced SARS-CoV-2 as the test organism. The first report listed the fabric tested as “CAZ”. The report provided stated “Good effect” after 10 minutes contact time with a log reduction of 2.31, and “Excellent effect” after 30 minutes contact time with a 5.12-log reduction.The second report listed the test product as “Antiviral non-woven mask”, with an “unmodified mask” acting as a control. The report showed a 98.73% rate of decrease on the test product after 10 minutes and a 99.99% decrease after 25 minutes. We also noted that both tests only reported the minimum-required log-4 (99.99%) decrease after 25-30 minutes’ contact time, with a much lower reduction reported after 10 minutes’ contact time. We considered that was not in line with the rapid effect consumers were likely to understand the mask had from the ad. Furthermore, the testing did not take into account how the abilities of the mask would be affected by factors involved in the real-life use of the mask, such as moisture or temperature changes from the wearer’s breathing, or by repeat washing of the item. We considered that the impression given by the ad, that the mask could rapidly kill COVID-19 particles that came into contact with it and would protect the wearer from contracting the virus, had not been adequately substantiated. We therefore concluded that the ad was misleading and breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP Code rules3.13.1Advertisements must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising) and3.93.9Broadcasters must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that the audience is likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

Because Wickes did not normally charge for the service, they therefore needed to show that consumers would pay £200 for similar services elsewhere in order to claim \"worth over £200\". We considered that the evidence provided by Wickes demonstrated that many companies charged for a kitchen design service and that, where companies made a charge, the £200 figure appeared to be in line with charges for a similar service. In the very specific context of an ad which promoted a supply and fitting service, and which took into account factors which included the home environment and requirements of individual customers, we considered that was a sufficient basis for the claim. We therefore concluded that the claim was not likely to mislead. We investigated the ad under BCAP Code rules3.13.1Advertisements must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.93.9Broadcasters must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that the audience is likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

This was also irrespective of the level of design service or the amount of design consultant time they required. They said that this was not the case with other kitchen retailers. They supplied examples of web pages from interior designers and kitchen companies which stated that design service fees ranging from £165.83 to £400 would be deducted in full or in part from the final payment if a customer went on to purchase a kitchen or other project. If they chose not to go ahead, they paid the full cost of the design service. Wickes believed that, as a service that other businesses charged for and which was capable of being charged for as a separate service, they were entitled to point out that there was no charge for the service at Wickes whether or not a customer went ahead with the purchase. Wickes acknowledged that the amount of input from the designer would vary from customer to customer, but said that the “over £200” figure was based on salary and employer costs and the amount of time a designer would spend with a customer who went through the full design service. Wickes said not all their competitors offered a design service and that, to put a figure on it in the way Wickes did, gave consumers an idea of the value of the service they would receive. Clearcast said they had initially questioned how a price could be put on a free service but subsequently agreed that it had an inherent value. They believed the claim was justified as long as the ad made clear that the design service was “worth” the figure claimed and did not claim that it was a price previously charged by Wickes." ;

The ad began with a voice-over, spoken by a child, which said, “Our story began with a dream, to see if we could take on an industry. It wasn't easy, but slowly, good began to happen.” Scenes of traffic moving, a port full of shipping containers, broken ice floating on the sea, litter in a river and a forest fire were shown. The voice-over continued, “But as the world produced more energy it became nature's problem, and we were part of it. An answer was needed so we started connecting the dots, to become a progressive energy and solutions partner, enriching lives for a sustainable future.” Solar panels, children in classrooms, a well being built and recycling in a factory were shown. The voice-over said, “To reduce emissions, grow renewable energy, bring education to more, champion social impact and promote a circular economy, as well as achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050” and text stating “Net Zero 2050” was shown on screen. The voice-over continued, “Let's connect the dots together and create a more sustainable future for all so that our next generation will always have something to look forward to” and a child was shown looking out into the distance.
By a ruling of June 7, 2023, the ASA upheld its challenge to the ad.
The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear and stated that claims could mislead if material information was omitted.
Consumers would understand the ad to mean that Petronas was already an energy company that was contributing to a sustainable future by making progress towards emissions reductions and growing the use of renewable energy, as well as having a plan in place that would result in it achieving these goals and net zero by 2050.
The acknowledgment in the ad that Petronas was part of “nature’s problem” was about their past contribution. It did not therefore counteract the claims in the ad about Petronas’s current activities and future plans.
Petronas told ASA that they were taking steps towards net zero and promoting sustainable energy, and these were reflected in the ad. Other claims in the ad were said to be intended to be aspirational rather than targets that had already been achieved. However, despite that, in 2021 Petronas’ operations produced 45.2 million tons of greenhouse gases. While viewers would recognise that companies in the oil industry were likely to be higher emitters of greenhouse gases than many other industries, they would not understand the extent of Petronas’ continuing significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions given the presentation and claims in the ad, which went beyond aspirational claims. The information about the balance of Petronas’ current activities, its emissions and the pathway to reducing them in line with the claims made in the ad, was therefore material information likely to affect consumers’ understanding of the ad’s overall message and so should have been made clear. The ad therefore omitted material information and was misleading.
The ASA ruled that the ad must not be broadcast again in its current form. The ASA told Petronas to ensure their future marketing communications did not misleadingly omit material information.
This Ruling formed part of a wider piece of work on environmental claims in the energy sector, following intelligence gathered by the Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”).""" ;

In a fixed contract, consumers paid one fixed price throughout the contract period. In a tiered contract, consumers agreed to pay different prices at different times. In a variable contract, consumers agreed to pay a core subscription price for the fixed term of the contract (notwithstanding any 'special introductory prices'), but the provider reserved the right to increase the price at their discretion. We understood that the contracts offered in this case were fixed ones. We considered that the monthly price of a contract was likely to be material to consumers when deciding on a telecommunications package, and that consumers were likely to understand from the ads that the price of their plans would be fixed for the duration of their contract. Ad (b) explicitly stated that there would be “no mid-contract rises on your Fixed Price Plan”. The name of the plan in that ad was also likely to reinforce the idea that prices would not rise for consumers during their contract. We acknowledged the increase in the usage of the network during the Covid-19 pandemic was unlikely to have been foreseen at the time the ads were seen. However, we disagreed with TalkTalk that consumers would not expect to pay a fixed price for the level of usage seen during the lockdowns. Consumers had agreed a price for their broadband to be delivered with a particular speed, to be used as required, and they would expect that price to be honoured. Consumers were likely to understand that some limitations would exist in many cases to advertising claims, and we agreed that a one-off incident would not undermine a general claim such as ‘next-day’ delivery, for example. However, in the context of the price of a contract which was described as ‘fixed’, we considered that consumers would expect to be able to rely on that price during the period for which it was claimed to be fixed. Because the ads claimed that the price of the contracts would be fixed for 24 months, and ad (b) claimed that there would be no mid-contract price rises, when that was not the case, we concluded that the ads were likely to mislead. Ad (a) breached BCAP Code rules3.13.1Advertisements must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising) and3.183.18Price statements must not mislead by omission, undue emphasis or distortion. They must relate to the product or service depicted in the advertisement.(Prices). Ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Advertisements must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising) and3.173.17Advertisements must not explicitly claim that the advertiser's job or livelihood is in jeopardy if consumers do not buy the advertised product or service.(Prices)." ;

It made clear that if a communications provider wanted to increase the monthly core subscription price (or prices) agreed by the customer at the point of sale, Ofcom was likely to regard it as a materially detrimental contract change requiring the customer to be given at least one month's written notice of the increase and the right to terminate their contract without penalty. The guidance made clear that the importance of the core subscription price in the subscriber's choice of contract meant it should be clear to the subscriber before entering into any contract what the price offered and agreed was. It said the subscriber should be able to compare offers, make informed decisions and rely on the price agreed. Whilst we noted the guidance, we assessed whether the ads breached the CAP and BCAP Codes." ;

They said the price could be changed in accordance with their terms and conditions, which included a clause stating that TalkTalk might need to change charges or agreements for legal, regulatory or business reasons. TalkTalk said the plans were designed and priced for a reasonable (pre-pandemic) environment such that consumers’ and TalkTalk’s expectations in paying a fixed price would be for a reasonable and normal usage of broadband. They believed it was reasonable to assume that neither consumers nor TalkTalk expected broadband usage, and the price thereof, to cover persistent long-term high usage as a result of lockdowns, including working from home, home schooling, being entertained and keeping in touch with friends, family and work colleagues. TalkTalk said their intent at the time the terms were created, and when the ads were made, was only to use the terms in exceptional circumstances, and they had not done so until April 2021. TalkTalk said they were committed to ensuring their network remained part of the UK’s critical national infrastructure, and material investment was required to maintain their network. As usage increased, demand increased and therefore more investment was required. Pricing under their plans was based on a certain level of usage and incremental usage, but not to the extent that such usage increased to during the lockdowns. They said usage of their network increased from 3.3 Tbps to 5.4 Tbps between the launch of the plans and the beginning of 2020 and then in 2020 alone, due to the lockdowns, it significantly increased from 5.4 Tbps to 7.6 Tbps. Further, they did not believe that consumers expected to pay a fixed price for the level of usage seen during the lockdowns. Therefore, due to exceptional circumstances, TalkTalk relied on the terms regarding fair usage and business reasons to make price changes. However, they believed the claims were justified and not materially misleading or likely to be misleading at the relevant times they were made. Unfortunately, the unlikely events had happened with the Covid-19 pandemic, meaning they had to change their approach to the plans, contrary to the claims, but that could not have been foreseen at the time. They believed the claims were substantiated at the time they were made because consumers would likely have understood the claims to mean that the price of the fixed price plans would be fixed during the minimum contract term, save in exceptional circumstances. TalkTalk believed that previous ASA rulings supported their position that claims usually had certain limited exceptions that were not expressly mentioned in marketing claims, and that it would be unrealistic to expect that terms that were unlikely to be relied upon, but which later were due to unlikely circumstances, would be specifically stated in an ad. They cited examples of limitations to a price guarantee, fair-usage policies on ‘unlimited’ data claims, and next-day delivery claims. Clearcast said at the time the ad script was cleared, they received confirmation that prices would be fixed for the minimum contract period of 24 months." ;

The MPF alleges that the defendant's occupation of the land was unlawful as it is part of an Agroextractivist Settlement Project (Projeto de Assentamento Agroextrativista - PAE), owned by and of interest to the Federal Union, managed by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA), and occupied by traditional extractivist communities. This ACP is part of a set of 22 actions filed by the MPF following an investigation conducted under Civil Inquiry No. 1.13.000.001719/2015-49, concerning illegal deforestation within the Antimary Agroextractivist Settlement Project (PAE), but involving different defendants. The claims in the action are based, among other points, on Brazilian Environmental Law, particularly regarding the constitutional protection of the environment, allegations of deforestation, strict liability for environmental damages—including climate-related damages—and collective moral damages. The claim also cites, as environmental liabilities, unauthorized greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the illegal deforestation, calculated at 69,196.81 tons of carbon dioxide. These emissions are directly tied to Brazil's deviation from its climate goals, conflicting with the country’s national and international commitments under the National Policy on Climate Change (Federal Law No. 12,187/2009) and the Paris Agreement." ;

Upheld Both ads (a) and (b) referred to Mum & You baby wipes as 100% biodegradable and featured the claim “our wipes break down quickly after they are thrown away; in as little as 15 days; even in landfill conditions”. In that context, the ASA considered consumers would understand the claim to mean that the wipes would completely biodegrade often within 15 days in all conditions in which they might be disposed, including landfill. We understood that the Mum & You wipes were made from viscose, a natural fibre derived from wood, and that viscose was able to biodegrade through the action of microorganisms to form water and carbon dioxide. We therefore understood that the wipes could eventually biodegrade in all conditions, including in environments such as landfills. However, given how consumers would understand the claim in the ads, we expected to see evidence that the baby wipes could fully biodegrade often within 15 days, in all conditions. The advertiser had provided three reports, which they said tested the compostability of the fibres used in the wipes, and the biodegradation of the wipes in landfill and home composting conditions. Regarding the biodegradation of the wipes in landfill conditions, we assessed whether the methodology used to determine the biodegradation rate reflected the likely conditions that would consistently be found at UK landfills. We noted the report stated that the test accelerated the biodegradation process because of the optimal conditions provided. The test used an anaerobic environment whereas we understood that when household waste was deposited at a landfill in the UK, the surrounding environment was aerobic and would only become anaerobic over time, and that this could take several months to a year. Additionally, during the test, the wipes were milled to less than 1mm in size and were then mixed with methane producing bacteria and kept in an incubator set at 37 degrees Celsius for the duration of the test. However, we understood that consumers would place the used wipe in the bin whole, and we had not seen evidence that the test’s approach of breaking up the wipe would not speed up the rate of biodegradation. Additionally, during the test, the wipes were clean. However, we understood that baby wipes were seldom thrown away clean. Rather, they were used to clean away organic matter, namely food, faeces and other bodily secretions. We had not seen evidence that the test took account of the effect such organic matter would have on the wipes’ biodegradation rate. Furthermore, we also understood that conditions would vary across a UK landfill, and in different landfills, depending on factors including the waste that had been deposited and compacted in a specific area, the moisture level, the temperature and the types of microorganisms that were present. We accepted that the report showed that the wipes fully biodegraded in the test conditions within 15 days. However, the test was carried out under optimal conditions, and it did not replicate the condition of the wipes at the time of disposal or the conditions of a landfill, including when rubbish first arrived there. We therefore considered the test was not appropriate to substantiate a claim that the wipes would completely biodegrade within 15 days of arriving at a landfill. We noted we had not been provided with any evidence relating to the speed of degradation of the wipes in aerobic landfill conditions. Regarding the biodegradation of the wipes in home composting, we considered that when the wipes were disposed of, they would often not be suitable for home composting because they would be contaminated with matter that should not be composted. However, we nonetheless assessed the evidence in relation to situations where the wipes might be composted at home. The report produced by the manufacturer of the viscose fibre used in the wipe stated that the fibre was fully compostable in soil conditions according to the European standard EN13432. However, we considered that because the wipe was made up of ingredients other than the viscose fibre, these could have affected the rate of compostability. Additionally, the report did not state the rate that the viscose fibre composted under the test conditions. We therefore considered that the test did not substantiate the claim. Regarding the compostability test that had been carried out on the wipe, we noted that the report post-dated the ad. Nonetheless, we assessed whether the methodology used to determine the biodegradation rate reflected the likely conditions that would consistently be found in home composts. The test used mature compost whereas we understood that when waste was deposited in the compost bin or pile, the surrounding organic matter was likely to be that of other recent waste. Although that waste may have already started to decompose, it would take months to reach maturity. We had not seen evidence that the test’s approach of mixing the wipe with mature compost would not have speeded up the rate of biodegradation. Additionally, during the test the compost was kept at 25 degrees Celsius and in the dark, the moisture content was monitored and adjusted as required, and it was stirred. We understood that there were different types of home composting structures, including composting bins and composting piles. We considered that the conditions, with regards to temperature, light level and moisture content would vary between different compost structures. Additionally, while most consumers would periodically stir the compost, we considered that most would not do so as frequently as was done during the test. We considered that the test conditions were optimal and therefore were likely to accelerate the biodegradation rate. Furthermore, during the test, the wipes were clean. As referenced above, baby wipes would most often be contaminated when they were thrown away. We had not seen evidence that the test took account of what effect that organic matter would have on the wipes’ biodegradation rate. We also considered that the specific composition of the compost would vary within and between composts depending on the other waste that had been composted, the environmental conditions mentioned above and the types of microorganisms that were present. We accepted that the test demonstrated that after two weeks only the border of the baby wipe remained intact, and after four weeks it was completely biodegraded. However, because the wipe was not completely biodegraded within 15 days, and because the test was carried out under optimal conditions and it did not replicate the conditions consistently found when home composting, we concluded that the test did not substantiate the claim as consumers would understand it. Because consumers would understand the claim to mean that the wipes would completely biodegrade often within 15 days in all conditions in which they might be disposed, including landfill, and the evidence we had seen did not substantiate that, nor had we seen evidence for the speed of degradation in all environments in which the wipe would be disposed, we concluded that it was misleading. On this point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation),11.311.3Absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation.

Upheld The CAP Code required that absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation, but that claims such as “greener” or “friendlier” could be justified if the advertised product provided a total environmental benefit over that of the advertiser’s previous product or competitor products and the basis of the comparison was clear. It also stated that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise. Claims that were based on only part of the advertised product’s life cycle must not mislead consumers about the product’s total environmental impact. We considered that consumers would understand the claim “Being biodegradable is important to us as it means today’s mess won’t be a problem for tomorrow’s generation” in ad (b) and the similarly worded claim in ad (a), to mean that, once the wipe had been disposed of, it would not have any negative impact on the environment. We considered that this was an absolute claim. We therefore expected to see evidence relating to the environmental impact of the wipe for the part of its life cycle from when it had been disposed of. However, we had not seen such evidence relating to the advertised product. As referenced at point 1, we accepted that the wipe was capable of physical decomposition. However, we understood that when organic waste such as the advertised wipe biodegraded in landfill anaerobically, it would emit methane. We understood that some landfills collected some of the methane that was produced, but that not all did. Because methane was a highly potent greenhouse gas, if it was released into the atmosphere it contributed to global warming; a problem which would affect future generations. We therefore considered that the disposal of the wipe could have a negative impact on the environment and we had not seen evidence to the contrary. We therefore concluded that the claim “Being biodegradable is important to us as it means today’s mess won’t be a problem for tomorrow’s generation”, and the similar claim in ad (a), had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. On this point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation.(Substantiation),11.311.3Absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. Comparative claims such as \"greener\" or \"friendlier\" can be justified, for example, if the advertised product provides a total environmental benefit over that of the marketer's previous product or competitor products and the basis of the comparison is clear.11.411.4Marketers must base environmental claims on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the marketing communication states otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle. If a general claim cannot be justified, a more limited claim about specific aspects of a product might be justifiable. Marketers must ensure claims that are based on only part of the advertised product's life cycle do not mislead consumers about the product's total environmental impact.and11.711.7Marketing communications must not mislead consumers about the environmental benefit that a product offers; for example, by highlighting the absence of an environmentally damaging ingredient if that ingredient is not usually found in competing products or by highlighting an environmental benefit that results from a legal obligation if competing products are subject to that legal obligation.(Environmental claims)." ;

Q River Ltd t/a Mum & You said their wipes were made from viscose, a plastic-like material derived from wood. The wipes were plastic free and made from 99.5% naturally derived ingredients. They provided two reports from a biodegradability testing company. The first related to the wipes’ biodegradation in landfill conditions, and the second to their biodegradation in home composting conditions. Both tests used industry standard methods. The first report calculated the biodegradation of Mum & You Baby Wipes according to the international standard ASTM D5511 (2018) “Standard Test Method for Determining Anaerobic Biodegradation of Plastic Materials Under High-Solids Anaerobic-Digestion Conditions”. The first test simulated an anaerobic landfill environment because the anaerobic digestion was a dry (>20% solids) and stationary (no mixing) environment. The test showed that, by 15 days, the wipe had an 86.6% biodegradation. This meant that 86.6% of the carbon in the wipe had been converted to carbon in the biogas (carbon dioxide and methane). The remaining carbon (13.4%) in the wipe was utilised by bacteria for energy. This demonstrated that the wipe degraded completely. Mum & You also provided a statement from the biodegradability testing company that said the test used by Mum & You was the most used test method worldwide to test landfill biodegradation. The testing company also said the test used by Mum & You was preferred over the test referenced by Procter & Gamble UK (P&G), which was the ASTM D5526 (2018) “Standard Test Method for Determining Anaerobic Biodegradation of Plastic Materials Under Accelerated Landfill Conditions”. Both test methods could be used to simulate biodegradation under landfill conditions. However, the test referenced by P&G was performed under less optimal conditions, and, as a result, took longer to obtain results and had more variation in the results obtained. The test used by Mum & You was more reliable and reproducible. As was common with lab tests, because of the optimised conditions, the test used by Mum & You was an accelerated test. In a real-life setting, the same level of biodegradation would be obtained but the rate would depend on local conditions, including, for example, temperature and humidity. Because the lab test had to follow strict protocols to enable the results to be repeatable and replicable, it could not contain every potential disposal scenario. They said they stated on their packaging, website and marketing communications that the ASTM D5511 (2018) test had been used to determine the biodegradability rate. However, they would amend the claim to clarify that the rate of biodegradation was based specifically on simulated landfill conditions. They recognised that the wipes would normally have some form of organic waste on them when they were disposed of. However, it was not practicable to test and measure the range of potential waste that may be on a used wipe. It was impossible to gauge what impact, if any, the organic contaminants would have of the speed of biodegradability. Additionally, the biodegradability claim was made about the wipe only. They believed that consumers, when purchasing the product, would understand that the claim related only to the wipe and did not extend to what the consumers then used the wipe to clean. The second test report, which was carried out after the ad was published, calculated the compostability of the wipes in a home compostability testing programme according to the European standard EN 13432 “Packaging: requirements for packaging recoverable through composting and biodegradation”. It mixed the wipe with compost – which consisted of mature compost and garden, fruit and vegetable waste – and was incubated at an ambient temperature in the dark. The test showed that, after two weeks, only the border of the wipe in the samples remained, and after four weeks the samples had completely disintegrated. The test was stopped after four weeks instead of the maximum duration of 26 weeks. They said that, prior to carrying out the above test, the manufacturer of the fibres in the wipe had provided them with a report that supported that the fibre was fully compostable according to the European standard EN 13432. They provided a copy of the report. They also provided a certificate from an accreditation organisation that certified that the wipes were compostable at home. 2. Mum & You said the vast majority of consumers in the UK had some knowledge about the possible options to alleviate the damage that had been caused to the environment by human activity, but that there was no instant cure. They considered consumers were aware that industries were slowly adapting to create replacement products that were more environmentally friendly, but that those products were probably not going to be perfect. They did not believe that consumers would expect a replacement for a wipe that contained plastic to be 100% environmentally friendly. Rather, a wipe that did not contain plastic would be less harmful to the environment than a wipe that did contain plastic and therefore would not biodegrade. They considered that consumers would understand the claim as stating that being biodegradable was important as it meant that today’s mess was less of a problem for tomorrow’s generation; not that it would solve all of the problems for tomorrow’s generation. They referred to a study that measured the full life cycle analysis (LCA) of wipes made from different materials and found that, compared to plastic-based wipes, bio-based wipes had a 38% lower environmental impact. Mum & You acknowledged that greenhouse gas emissions were produced when biodegradable wipes were placed in landfill, but understood that most of the methane was captured on site and used as an energy source. Additionally, the use of controlled biological processes such as anaerobic digestion allowed for the methane to be captured in a closed system, which prevented it from being released into the atmosphere. Plastic-based wipes would have been produced in a high carbon emitting process, released microplastics into the environment, caused sewage blockages and contributed to plastic pollution. They believed that a product that did not contain plastic and was 100% biodegradable, but emitted greenhouse gases during its biodegradation, was still better for the environment than a similar non-biodegradable, plastic containing wipe. They did not claim that the wipes were carbon neutral or net zero." ;

The ad featured a testimonial from a customer who stated, “Because I live in a small flat, I used to hang my clothes on the radiator or clotheshorse. I used to find condensation and the smell of damp clothes all the time. Now I put things in the DriBUDDi, it’s just gone”. The ad showed various clothes and a towel sitting on a radiator with condensation appearing on the window above, followed by a close-up image of water droplets on a window." ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "Upheld The ASA understood that the DriBUDDi was a drying pod used to dry laundry indoors. The fabric zip-on cover created an enclosed space in which heated air circulated and featured small holes at the top of the cover to allow air flow. We noted that the testimonial was given by a man who compared his experience of drying clothes on the radiator in a small flat with using the DriBUDDi. When he used the DriBUDDi, he noted that the smell of damp and condensation was “just gone”. During his testimonial, the ad showed several items drying on a radiator with condensation on the window above, followed by a zoomed-in shot of condensation on a window. Whilst we acknowledged that the claim appeared clearly within a testimonial, we considered that viewers would interpret it as a claim about the product’s efficacy which was capable of objective substantiation, rather than a subjective claim based solely on personal experience. We therefore considered viewers would understand that the DriBUDDi, itself, was able to prevent the smell of damp and condensation produced by drying clothes inside, particularly in a small household space. We firstly assessed the evidence provided by Clearcast. We examined the first article which they considered substantiated the claims in the ad. We noted that it originated from a science magazine; it outlined the physical process underpinning the drying of clothes and discussed the different methods of drying clothes indoors. The article commented only on the speed and running cost of drying pods in comparison to other heated airers. It did not examine the amount of condensation produced by drying pods, and consequently, we considered that the article was not relevant to the efficacy claim in the ad. The second article was a consumer magazine review of the best and cheapest methods of drying clothes indoors. It assessed the benefits and disadvantages of drying pods in terms of their capacity, price and speed. While the article identified that other drying methods either fought or brought risk of damp, the article was silent on how a drying pod affected dampness. However, because neither article evidenced that drying pods prevented condensation from forming, we considered that they were not relevant to the claims made in the ad and did not demonstrate the efficacy of the product. We then assessed the testimonial documents supplied by Clearcast, which were signed by the speakers in the ad. We acknowledged that evidence showed the testimonials were genuine. However, we considered that personal or customer endorsement alone did not substantiate the efficacy claim as consumers would understand it. We therefore expected JML to hold objective substantiation that demonstrated the product prevented condensation from forming when used as advertised. We next examined the in-house test reports. We noted that the first test used nine garments, with a dry weight of 1.74 kg and a washed weight of 2.66 kg. The garments were weighed again at the end of the test to verify that they had dried completely. In order to test the efficacy of the DriBUDDi’s ability to prevent condensation forming, the humidity of the room was measured before and after the garments had dried. We noted that before drying, the humidity of the room was 53%, and after, it had dropped to 50%. The test also relied on physical observation of the environment to monitor whether condensation formed on the window while the DriBUDDi was in use. From the video footage of the first test, we noted that condensation was not visible on the window or any of the surfaces in the room during or after the test. While the test results suggested that humidity decreased during the test, we considered that did not necessarily indicate there was less moisture in the air. We understood the humidity measurement provided by JML was ‘relative humidity’, which measured, as a percentage, the amount of moisture present in the air relative to the amount that would be present if the air was saturated. We understood that warm air could hold more moisture than cold air, and therefore, increasing the temperature of the air while keeping the moisture level constant would decrease the relative humidity, as the air had greater capacity to hold moisture. With that in mind, we understood that as the DriBUDDi heated the room, the air temperature increased, causing the relative humidity of the room to decrease. However, we understood that did not mean the DriBUDDi reduced the level of moisture in the air, rather that the air was now warmer and able to hold more moisture before reaching saturation. For that reason, we did not consider the results sufficiently evidenced that the DriBUDDi prevented condensation. Furthermore, we noted that this test was performed with considerably less laundry than the advertised capacity of the DriBUDDi. While the ad stated that the DriBUDDi could hold up to 18 garments or 10 kg of washing, the test was performed using only nine garments that weighed 2.66 kg. We understood that the volume of laundry would significantly affect the level of moisture present in the DriBUDDi and within the test environment. Because the test had not been conducted with 10 kg of laundry, and therefore did not demonstrate that the DriBUDDi could be used at its advertised capacity without the formation of condensation, we further considered the test was not sufficient to substantiate the claim. In addition, we considered that the test conditions were not representative of the typical household room in which the DriBUDDi would be used. We noted that the videos of the first test, supplied by JML, showed the DriBUDDi operating in a large room with an internal window facing a warehouse floor. However, we considered that, because the internal window was sheltered from the outside air, it would have a higher surface temperature than if it was an external window, as typical in the average UK home. We understood that condensation formed when water vapour came into contact with cold surfaces, and therefore we considered that the temperature of the window was an important factor in whether condensation formed. We also considered that the size of the room was a significant variable in the test, which neither matched the description of the small flat in the testimonial nor the average household room in which the product would be used. We understood that a larger room afforded more space for the air to circulate, and it was less likely that the air would become saturated with water vapour, causing condensation. Therefore, we considered that, by conducting the test in an environment which did not represent the average UK home, and in conditions that would likely result in less condensation, the study was insufficient to substantiate the claim. JML then repeated the test in a household room with a larger volume of washing. The test used 18 garments, with a dry weight of 3.82 kg and a washed weight of 5.42 kg. Similarly, the test relied on observation of the environment to detect the presence of condensation. We firstly noted that the size of the room was not given by JML, nor apparent from the video. We further noted that the quality of the video was low and as a result, the light coming through the window behind the DriBUDDi obscured the surface of the glass. It was therefore difficult to discern whether condensation had formed. Given that the test relied solely on observation, we concluded the test was not documentary evidence for the claim and was insufficient to prove the claim that the DriBUDDi prevented condensation. We understood that the User Guide for the JML DriBUDDi stated that the product “should only be used in a well-ventilated area. If ventilation is lacking, it can also be used near an open window”. We accepted that ventilation was important to mitigate condensation formed by clothes drying indoors, as it allowed moisture to move from the room. We therefore considered that if the DriBUDDi was used according to the User Guide, in a room sufficiently well-ventilated, the formation of condensation may be prevented. However, we considered that the impression of the ad was that the DriBUDDi itself prevented condensation from forming, rather than environmental factors such as ventilation or presence of an open window. For that reason, we considered that the ad exaggerated the capabilities of the DriBUDDi. Given that the studies provided were insufficient to prove the claim that the DriBUDDi prevented condensation, and the User Guide indicated that the prevention of condensation was due to external factors, we concluded that the claim exaggerated the capabilities of the DriBUDDi and had not been substantiated.

They believed viewers would interpret the claim within that context and understand that it was intended to compare the user experience of the DriBUDDi with that of drying clothes on a radiator inside. JML provided results from two in-house tests. In the first test, they used the DriBUDDi to dry nine garments, weighing 1.74 kg dry and 2.66 kg after washing, over the space of two hours. The then followed up with a second test, which tested 18 garments weighing 3.82 kg dry and 5.42 kg after washing. They supplied videos of each test which demonstrated test conditions. They observed that throughout both tests, condensation had not formed on the window next to where the DriBUDDi stood. They said that proved the claim in the testimonial was accurate and not misleading. They explained that excess moisture in the air led to condensation which could form on walls, windows and other surfaces, but because the DriBUDDi was an enclosed space, moisture was kept inside the fabric cover. Clearcast said that they had been clearing ads for the JML DriBUDDi for over 10 years and believed the way the product worked was widely understood by audiences. Hot air circulated within the ‘cocoon’ covering of the DriBUDDi to allow for a speedier drying time and to prevent moisture from escaping onto windows and walls. They referred to two articles which highlighted the benefits of using heated drying pods, and that research conducted by the University of Manchester found that drying clothes on radiators raised moisture levels in the home by up to 30%. They also said that, while the original data to support the claim was not easily accessible, the advertiser had provided results of two tests which substantiated the claim in question. Clearcast also supplied forms that were signed by the individuals who they said had given testimonials in the ad, confirming that the views expressed were true and genuine. Clearcast acknowledged that testimonials alone were not adequate substantiation for an objective claim; however, they believed that the forms nonetheless supported that the claims were accurate to the users’ experience." ;

The TV ad featured a woman about to eat a burger while watching television. The programme she was watching said, “The planet is continuing to warm” after which the voice-over said, “Now that’s not what Zoe likes to hear, but she’s gonna roll up her sleeves and do her bit […] and there it is, a delicious Tesco plant chef burger. We’ve lowered the price of dozens of our Plant Chef products because a little swap can make a difference to the planet.” b. The VOD ad seen on the ITV Hub was the same as ad (a). c. The radio ad stated, “It may not sound like it, but Zoe here is doing her bit for the planet. By swapping to Tesco Plant Chef burgers every now and then, she’s making a difference, not by much, but every little, well you know, and we’re all for it. So we’ve lowered the price of dozens of our Plant Chef products. Good for your pocket, even better for the planet.” d. The press ad featured a woman biting into a burger with text which stated “We’ve lowered the price of dozens of Plant Chef products because a little swap is good for your pocket and even better for the planet”. Either side of the burger was text which stated “Every” and “helps”. e. The tweet, posted on 25 October 2021, featured text which stated “We’ve lowered the price of dozens of Plant Chef products, making it easier for you to swap every now and then. Good for your pocket, even better for the planet. Make the swap at tes.co/plantchef”. It included a video of a woman eating a burger accompanied by text which stated “We’ve lowered the price of dozens of Plant Chef products, like this burger”. f. The website www.tesco.com, on the groceries page stated, “We’ve lowered the price of dozens of Plant Chef products Because a little swap is good for your pocket and even better for the planet”. Underneath an image of a woman eating a burger, text stated “As a nation, if we swapped beef for a plant-based alternative just 1 out of 5 times, the amount of CO2 emissions we could save would be the equivalent to driving 27 billion fewer miles in a car!”" ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "1., 2. & 3. Upheld The CAP and BCAP Codes stated that environmental claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle. They also stated that comparative claims could be justified if the advertised product provided a total environmental benefit over that of the advertiser’s previous product or competitor product and the basis of the comparison was clear. The ASA acknowledged that it was generally accepted amongst the scientific community that diets which included meat, and particularly red meat, had a greater environmental impact than plant-based diets, and that switching to a more plant-based diet was a way in which individuals could reduce their overall environmental impact. However, we also recognised that specific plant-based products, particularly processed products which could contain a number of different ingredients sourced from around the world, could nevertheless contain ingredients or be produced and transported by methods that had a high carbon or negative environmental impact. Notwithstanding the general benefits of plant-based diets in broad environmental terms, it would not necessarily always be the case that specific plant-based products would always be guaranteed to have a lower carbon or environmental impact than specific meat-based products. All of the ads referred to Tesco’s Plant Chef product range, and the Plant Chef plant-based burger in particular and mentioned swapping to those products. We considered that consumers would understand that ads (a) to (f) were promoting a swap from a meat burger, such as beef, to Tesco’s Plant Chef plant-based burger, rather than understanding the claim to be a general claim about swapping from meat to plant-based food in general. We considered the claims “a little swap can make a difference to the planet”, “even better for the planet” and, “a little swap is […] even better for the planet” would be understood to mean that such a swap would make a positive environmental impact on the planet. We noted that ad (e) featured the URL tes.co/plantchef, which was a link to other products in the Plant Chef range and did not provide any additional information to substantiate the claims regarding the environmental benefit of the Plant Chef burger over a meat burger. Beneath the image of the woman eating a Plant Chef burger, ad (f) stated “As a nation, if we swapped beef for a plant-based alternative just 1 out of 5 times, the amount of CO2emissions we could save would be the equivalent to driving 27 billion fewer miles in a car!” We recognised that information suggested a more general premise that swapping meat for a plant-based diet generally was better for the environment. However, we considered the focus of all the ads was to promote the Tesco Plant Chef range, as highlighted by the claim that “We’ve lowered the price of dozens of Plant Chef products”, rather than to promote a move to eating a more plant-based diet generally. Because we considered the ads implied that switching to products in the Plant Chef range would positively affect the environment, we expected to see evidence that that was the case based on the full life cycle of the Plant Chef burger in comparison with a meat burger. However, we understood that Tesco did not hold any evidence in relation to the full lifecycle of any of the products in the Plant Chef range, or of the burger featured in the ads. We were therefore unable to assess the product’s total environment impact over its life cycle compared with that of a meat burger. Because we had not seen evidence in relation to ads (a) to (f) that demonstrated that Plant Chef products could make a positive environmental difference to the planet compared to their meat equivalents, nor had we seen evidence for the full life cycle of the Plant Chef burger, we concluded the claims regarding their positive benefits to the planet had not been substantiated and were likely to mislead.

They must not mislead by hiding material information or presenting it in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner.Material information is information that consumers need in context to make informed decisions about whether or how to buy a product or service.

However, the ASA understands that some plant-based products may contain a combination of ingredients, which may have been subject to complex production processes – such products could theoretically result in their having a similar or greater negative environmental impact than basic plant ingredients, or a meat-based alternative. The Code requires that environmental claims about an advertised product are based on its full life cycle and if they are not, such claims are likely to breach the Code unless the ad makes this clear and does not mislead consumers about the product’s total environmental impact.

Tesco Stores Ltd t/a Tesco said all the ads featured a plant-burger and made reference to the “Plant Chef products”, a range of 100% plant-based products. Tesco said their internal customer insight showed price was one of customers biggest barriers to purchasing and consuming more plant-based foods. So to make plant-based eating more accessible they reduced the prices of products in the range, which was the key focus of the ads, although they all featured claims which considered the environmental impacts of plant-based products. Tesco said the claims were not, nor were they meant to be, absolute environmental claims, as they did not claim that the products were wholly sustainable or good for the planet. Rather, the claims were all explicitly comparative in nature because they highlighted that by “swapping” to products such as Plant Chef products, it “can make a difference to the planet”, or that such a swap would be better for the planet. They said the obvious alternative to the plant-based products were burgers containing meat and therefore they formed the basis of the comparison. Tesco said the most important element of the claims was the emphasis on the “swap” or “swapping”, which meant that an equivalent meat-based product was being taken from the shopping basket and replaced by a Plant Chef product. They said the average consumer was being asked to make a change by way of a substitution.Tesco said the ads made a limited claim as to the marginal gain, when all other things were equal, that switching to a plant-based product could make. For example, ads (a) and (b) said “a little swap can make a difference”. Ad (c) said “she’s making a difference, not by much, but every little …”. Tesco said the wording “little” played an important part in determining the breadth of the claims. They said they were not claiming that the products were sustainable or good in and of themselves, but that by eating plant-based products, as opposed to meat-based, consumers could make a small or “little” difference. In addition, by using the word “better” it showed that the benefit could be achieved over the compared product, namely the meat equivalent. Tesco said they believed the average consumer, being aware of both meat and plant-based products, would understand that by making a swap to such plant-based products, it could make a difference to the planet and in that specific way the Plant Chef product was “better” for the planet, or less detrimental to the environment then their meat equivalents. They said the basis of the claims was clear. Tesco said to support the claims they had worked with a UK University and a charity to advise them in relation to the environmental impacts of plant-based versus comparable meat-based products. They relied on third party and scientifically led publications which all contained similar conclusions, that plant-based diets could have environmental benefits for the planet; they provided copies of that supporting documentation. Tesco said they considered that there was widespread scientific evidence to support the claims that a “swap” to plant-based products could make a difference to, or be better for the planet, when compared to the production and consumption of equivalent meat-based products. Tesco said those views were widely shared, understood or capable of being understood by the average consumer, in the context of the grocery market. Regarding the ingredients in the Plant Chef range, Tesco said they were committed to zero-net deforestation in their sourcing of palm oil and as members of the Consumer Good Forum had achieved that by 2020. They said they were also a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) which supported sustainable palm oil production, which ensured that 100% of the palm oil in their own brand products, including Plant Chef was RSPO certified. Tesco said that although some of the Plant Chef products contained ingredients that would have been imported from other countries, according to the scientific studies they had considered, the presence of imported ingredients did not negate the environmental benefits created by those products. Even with such factors considered, the benefits of swapping to plant-based products was still apparent. Tesco said their ads did not make any comparisons with any particular country or farming method. They said consumers would understand that the comparison being made was to typical comparable products such as Tesco beef burgers, in comparable packaging and not a comparison to products such as those which might be delivered directly and locally from ‘farm to butcher’ as those products were not commonly available in Tesco. Clearcast said they fully endorsed Tesco’s response in relation to ad (a). They said they did not invite Tesco to substantiate their qualified and comparative environmental claim because they considered that there was already adequate published science-based research as well as ASA guidance which made the claim a generally accepted one.

They said the phrase \"even better for the planet\" was cleared because, as Tesco said, reducing meat consumption was one small step, amongst many others, that listeners could take to reduce their carbon footprint." ;

The first claimed “… we’re taking a louder, bolder approach to sustainable aviation” in the body of the text, and “… you’ll earn Etihad Guest Miles every time you make a conscious choice for the planet … Environmental airline of the year” in the accompanying video. The second claimed “… we’re taking a louder, bolder approach to sustainable aviation” in the body of the text and “… we’re cutting back on single-use plastics and are flying the most efficient planes. Flights with a smaller footprint … Environmental airline of the year” in the accompanying video.
The Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) challenged whether the ads were misleading because they exaggerated the environmental benefits of flying with Etihad. By ruling of Apr. 12, 2023, the ASA upheld that challenge.
The CAP Code required that absolute environmental claims be supported by a high level of substantiation.
Etihad had commented that the claim “sustainable aviation” would be understood, especially in the aviation industry, as a long-term, multifaceted goal, which included their aspiration to reach “net zero” carbon emissions by 2050. However, the ads were aimed at the general public, and they did not mention Etihad’s desire to be “net-zero” by 2050 or position the claim “sustainable aviation” as a long-term aspiration.
Etihad had commented about the use of modern aircraft and flight practices to reduce emissions. However air travel continued to produce high levels of CO2 and non-CO2 emissions which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. Many of the initiatives Etihad said they were committed to delivering were targeted to only deliver results years or decades into the future. Further, initiatives such as reducing single use plastics and using more efficient aircraft were not adequate substantiation to evidence a \"sustainable aviation\" claim.
While steps were being taken by Etihad to reduce the environmental impact of its service, there were currently no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry which would adequately substantiate an absolute green claim such as “sustainable aviation” as we considered consumers would interpret it in this context.
The claim therefore exaggerated the impact that flying with Etihad would have on the environment and the ads breached the Code. Etihad was told to ensure that their ads did not give a misleading impression of the impact caused by travelling with the airline and that robust substantiation was held to support them.""" ;

(Mizuho), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG) breached the Guidelines with regard to their financing of coal power plants in Vietnam. The complaints allege that SMBC, MUFG and Mizuho are in breach of OECD guidelines because they failed to provide environmental and social impact assessments and consequently failed to urge project sponsors to assess and prevent or minimize environmental damage. They claim that the project’s emissions intensity (estimated at 860-880g CO2/kWh) is of an unacceptably high level by international standards, and would generate twice as much CO2 per unit of power generated as the average electricity generating plant in Vietnam. In addition they allege that banks were made aware about the environmental impacts of the project, but there is no evidence that they took any steps to influence their client to disclose additional environmental information or to implement additional mitigation measures that would reduce the project’s emissions. Further, they failed to adequately consult communities that were affected by the coal-fired power stations." ;

Luciano Lliuya’s suit, supported by NGO Germanwatch, alleged that RWE, having knowingly contributed to climate change by emitting substantial volumes of greenhouse gases (GHGs), bore some measure of responsibility for the melting of mountain glaciers near his town of Huaraz. Especially, as the melting gave rise to an acute threat: Palcacocha, a glacial lake located above Huaraz, has experienced substantial volumetric increase since 1975, which has dramatically accelerated from 2003 onwards. Luciano Lliuya presented several legal theories in support of his claim, including one that characterized RWE's emissions as a nuisance due to which plaintiff had incurred compensable costs to mitigate. Acknowledging that RWE was a contributor to the emissions responsible for climate change and thus for the lake's growth, Luciano Lliuya asked the court to order RWE to reimburse him for a portion of the costs that he and the Huaraz authorities are expected to incur from setting up flood protections. The share calculated amounted to 0.47% of the total cost - the same percentage as RWE’s estimated contribution to global industrial greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of industrialization (from 1751 onwards)." ;

However, it had subsequently been promoted by bet365 into users’ Twitter feeds. Because bet365 had promoted the tweet, we considered that they had incorporated all of the tweet’s contents into their advertising, and the whole tweet was therefore an ad for bet365. The CAP Code stated that marketing communications for gambling products must not be likely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture. They must not include a person or character whose example was likely to be followed by those aged under 18 years or who had strong appeal to those aged under 18. We noted the CAP Guidance “Gambling and lotteries: Protecting under-18s” stated that football was an activity in which a very significant proportion of under-18s participated directly on a frequent basis and had a general interest in through following professional teams and players across a variety of media. There was also a highly developed infrastructure around organised participation and the sport had an exceptionally high media profile including popular, dedicated media for under-18s. Those who played at an elite level were likely to appeal strongly to children and young persons. The guidance also stated that UK footballers who played for top clubs were considered high-risk in terms of how likely they were to be of strong appeal to under-18s. The ad included Granit Xhaka who was a player at Arsenal Football Club at the time the ad was seen and would be well known to the fans of that club, and also to those who followed Premier League football more generally, including children. We also considered that he would be well known for being captain of the Swiss national team. We therefore considered he was likely to be of strong appeal to under-18s. We considered that it would have been acceptable for the ad to appear in a medium where under-18s, for all intents and purposes, could be entirely excluded from the audience. That would apply in circumstances where those who saw the ad had been robustly age-verified as being 18 or older, such as through marketing lists that had been validated by payment data or credit checking. Because Twitter was a media environment where users self-identified on customer sign-up, and did not use robust age-verification, we considered that bet365 had not excluded under-18s from the audience with the highest level of accuracy required for ads the content of which was likely to appeal to under-18s. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 16.1, 16.3 and 16.3.12 (Gambling)." ;

They said the main video content and the main text of the tweet was produced by the publisher, which in this case was Sky Sports Premier League. Bet365 said it was designed to replicate the broadcasting of ads ahead of sport content on television and that for this ad, they had acquired the rights for their ads to appear on a pre-roll video ahead of the Sky Sports Premier League content in the tweet. Due to that, the content in the body of the tweet and the main video was produced by Sky Sports and therefore the tweet and video content from Sky Sports was separate to the bet365 part of the tweet. Bet365 said controls existed to ensure that their Amplify content would only be promoted to users over 25 years of age and above. They also said they ensured that no individuals with strong appeal to young persons were included in the pre-roll advertising that they produced, prior to being shown to the Sky Sports content. Bet365 said 0.2% of Sky Sports Premier League’s Twitter account was registered to those under the age of 18. They further said the bet365 part of the video ran for five seconds, in comparison to the Sky Sports Premier League part of the video which ran for 21 seconds. Bet365 said the ad was targeted to be delivered to those over 25 years of age, and believed the ad was not served to anyone under 25. Whilst they did not believe that the Premier League highlight clip was incorporated into their advertising, they provided details of Granit Xhaka’s audience demographics on Instagram and TikTok at the request of the ASA. They said he did not have a public profile on Twitter. On Instagram, 0.4% were registered as under 18. On TikTok, 32.3% were registered as under 18. They said his total audience demographic for both platforms showed that 3.38% were registered as under 18. Bet365 said Granit Xhaka did not have a verified profile on Twitter and that bet365 did not have a TikTok profile or presence and they did not carry out any marketing on that platform. Sky Sports said they were not aware of having received complaints in relation to the tweet, but that they had no further comments to make. Twitter said the promoted tweet in question was part of an Amplify Sponsorship campaign using the website card format. They said it was not in breach of Twitter’s Ad Policies and they were not aware of having received complaints about it. They said in the event the complaint was upheld, the ad would be removed." ;

The ad featured two women in front of the Giza Pyramids in Egypt, alongside the text “People & planet-friendly small group adventures since 1989”.
A complaint was made to the Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”). The complainant challenged whether the claim “people & planet-friendly small group adventures” misleadingly minimized the impact of Intrepid Travel’s holidays on the environment.
By ruling of May 31, 2023, the ASA upheld that complaint.
The CAP Code stated that the basis of environmental claims must be clear, and that unqualified claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. It also stated that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise, and required that marketing communications did not mislead consumers about a product’s total environmental impact. The Code further required that absolute claims were supported by a high level of substantiation.
Intrepid Travel had commented that they did not offer flights as part of their travel packages, and that consumers would therefore understand that the claim was a narrow reference to their tour offering only. However, the claim was not qualified with that information. The presentation of the Giza Pyramids in Egypt within the ad, together with the claim “planet-friendly”, indicated that such tours were international and that it would be necessary to travel, in most cases by flying, to take part in their tours.
The claim “people & planet-friendly small group adventures” was an absolute claim, which would be understood to mean that taking part in an Intrepid tour caused no environmental damage throughout its full life cycle. The ASA therefore expected to see evidence which demonstrated that taking part in an Intrepid Travel tour, including the necessary travel to and from the destination location, caused no environmental damage over its full life cycle.
Whilst Intrepid Travel took part in a number of environmental schemes, these did not relate to the life cycle of a holiday with Intrepid Travel, and they had not been referred to in the ad. Also many of these initiatives were targeted to deliver results years into the future. Also, whilst Intrepid Travel had a carbon offsetting programme, resulting in it being certified as carbon neutral, Intrepid Travel did not calculate all greenhouses gases produced by their consumers travelling to and from their tour locations, nor did their offsetting programme take account of those emissions.
Because air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which made a substantial contribution to climate change, and those emissions were not accounted for by Intrepid Travel, the absolute claim “people & planet-friendly adventures” had not been adequately substantiated. The ad had misleadingly minimized the impact of Intrepid Travel’s holidays.
The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again in the form complained of. The ASA told Intrepid Travel to ensure that the basis of future environmental claims was made clear and did not give a misleading impression of the impact of their holidays, and that robust substantiation was held to support future claims.""" ;

The ad appeared in The Economist magazine, which was read by consumer and business readers, as well as politicians and public policy professionals. The ASA therefore considered members of those groups were the ad’s likely audience. While the ad was not for a directly purchasable product or service, we considered it was likely to raise Equinor’s profile and influence readers’ opinions of Equinor as a brand by increasing awareness of their activities and plans in the UK. Readers of The Economist were likely to have an awareness that many companies in carbon-intensive industries, including the oil and gas sector, were in the process of investing in renewable alternatives to fossil fuels to help governments, businesses, and consumers reduce their emissions in response to the climate crisis and in their transition to net zero. Those who were concerned about the environmental impact of activities related to higher-carbon energy sources would be interested in seeking out, supporting, or promoting businesses, including oil and gas companies, who were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services, including those investing in renewable energy production, such as wind farms, and technology such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, ads were likely to mislead if they exaggerated the contribution that lower-carbon initiatives played, or would play in the near future, as part of the overall balance of a company's activities when making claims about green initiatives. The ad featured an image of a worker on an oil rig, with another oil rig visible in the distance. Text in the body of the ad included “Wind, oil, gas, carbon capture”, and further text at the bottom of the ad stated “we’re producing the oil and gas the UK needs now; and will be powering millions more homes with wind, capturing and storing carbon safely”. We considered the overall impression of the ad was that Equinor’s current and near future business activities in the UK included providing energy sourced from a mix of fossil fuels such as oil and gas, and renewable sources such as wind, as well as capturing and storing carbon dioxide. The claim “Wind, oil, gas, carbon capture”, gave equal prominence to each of those activities. In the absence of sufficient qualifying information that, together with the further text at the bottom of the ad, was likely to be interpreted to mean that CCS and energy sourced from windfarms formed a significant proportion of Equinor’s current and near future activities, alongside oil and gas. We understood Equinor were a partner-investor in several UK windfarms, and were involved in several CCS projects in the north-east of the UK. Equinor’s 2022 Integrated Annual Report (the Report) stated that their total scope 1 and 2 operated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 11.4 million tonnes CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent). Equinor also held significant interests in international oil fields, including the UK’s Rosebank oil field, in which it held a 40% stake, which had increased to 80% in 2023. We understood from the report that their oil and gas production stood at around 2,039 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022. Additionally, the Report stated that in 2022 their capital expenditure on renewable investments stood at 14%, growing to 30% by 2025. Furthermore, we understood from the Report that large-scale global oil and gas investment and extraction formed the vast majority of Equinor’s business activities and would continue to do so in the near future. While the ad was clear that the UK energy blend was in transition, it gave the overall impression that CCS and energy sourced from windfarms formed a significant proportion of Equinor’s business activities, alongside oil and gas. We therefore considered further information about the overall proportion of Equinor’s business model that comprised renewable energy and CCS was material information that should have been included. Because the ad did not include that information, we concluded it omitted significant information and was therefore likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 11.1 (Environmental claims)." ;

The ad highlighted Equinor’s contributions to the UK beyond oil and gas, including their renewable energy and carbon capture activities. They said the ad was a one-off that had been published in The Economist magazine. It did not advertise any consumable product or service, and was not aimed at the general public, but at decision-makers and their influencers, a group that included politicians in government and opposition, as well as advisors and journalists. They said that group would not make decisions based solely on the information featured in the ad, and would carry out their own due diligence, which could include scrutinising Equinor’s policies and plans. Equinor said the ad did not feature subjective or vague terms, and stated facts about the fields in which Equinor was involved, and signalled their recognition that a transition towards cleaner fuels was necessary and would occur. The transition to cleaner energy required investment, innovation, and a broad mix of energy sources, and that it was essential to strike a balance between providing energy security while also enabling that transition. Equinor highlighted that the words “oil” and “gas” appeared prominently in the ad, and the text at the bottom of the ad stated they were “producing the oil and gas the UK needs now”. Additionally, it featured an image of an oil and gas worker on an oil rig, looking out to another oil rig. The ad did not engage in a discussion of the merits or environmental impact of oil and gas production versus energy from wind power or carbon capture and storage. Its aim was to show that Equinor was engaged in a broad energy mix, and illustrated the activities in which Equinor was involved. Equinor’s ambition was to become net zero by 2050. To that end, they were engaged in cutting emissions from oil and gas production and developing new technology to accelerate decarbonisation. They were also leveraging digitalisation and technology to reduce production emissions and the carbon footprint of their offshore oil and gas production. They were a partner and operator in the Sherringham Shoal, Dudgeon, Hywind Scotland, and Dogger Bank windfarms – the latter of which was still under construction – and a partner-licence holder in the Endurance Carbon Capture and Storage hub.

The lawsuit is based, among other things, on Brazilian environmental law concerning the constitutional protection of the environment, the accusation of deforestation, propter rem civil liability for environmental damage, including climate damage, and collective moral damages. It also mentions the unauthorized emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) caused by the illegal deforestation of the area, calculated at 108,820.37 tons of carbon dioxide and which are directly related to the Brazilian State's departure from its climate goals, in disagreement with national and international commitments assumed by Brazil in the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009) and in the Paris Agreement (promulgated by Federal Decree 9.073/2017).

The ads were in support of the proposed expansion of LLA and featured the headline claim “If we miss our environmental limits, our expansion will be stopped in its tracks”. They made reference to a Green Controlled Growth Framework which contained legally enforceable and independently monitored environmental limits. Ad (a) explained that those limits included restrictions on the expanding airport’s noise, carbon, air quality and road traffic impacts. Ad (b) provided no further information about the limits. The ASA considered people would understand the main aim of the LLA expansion was to facilitate an increase in capacity at the airport, which would include expansion in the volume of flights the airport could support. The purpose of the ads was therefore to reassure people about the efforts being taken to mitigate the environmental impacts caused by expansion. We considered people would understand from the ads that the proposed expansion was subject to environmental limits and that if they were breached the expansion would stop. Ad (a) included information about the limits in the Green Controlled Growth Framework, which included limits on the expanding airport’s carbon impact. The ad also referred to the expanding airport’s “noise impacts”, which under the proposals included noise from air traffic movement (i.e., landing take-off cycle, and the climb, cruise and descent phase) resulting from the expansion. This would be likely to be understood, in the context of an airport, as meaning noise from both the airport’s ground operations, and from the air traffic movement. We considered the term “carbon impacts” would also be understood in that context, and that people who saw ad (a) would therefore interpret the reference to “carbon” as meaning carbon emissions from both the expanded airport’s ground operations and from the increase in air traffic movement. Ad (b) did not provide further information about the limits included in the Green Controlled Growth Framework. We considered people who saw the ad would understand, from references to “environmental limits” that they would include emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG). They were also likely to assume that limits relating to emissions from an airport would include those from air traffic movement, and would therefore interpret the phrase “environmental limits” in that context as meaning the limits included carbon emissions from both airport ground operations and emissions from air traffic movement. We considered the image of an aeroplane taxiing on a runway in both ads contributed to the impression that emissions from air traffic movement would be a key factor into the Green Controlled Growth Framework. The proposed expansion was due to happen in two phases – in the first the current LLA terminal building would be expanded, and in the second an additional terminal would be built and later expanded. The project was due to take place over a number of years, with monitoring of the different limits on expansion conducted annually. The Green Controlled Growth Framework identified three principal sources of GHG emissions arising from the proposed expansion – airport operations, surface access and air traffic movements. However, although the Green Controlled Growth Framework included limits on noise from all three sources, only the first two were included in the environmental limits on expansion for carbon emissions, with air traffic movements excluded. We understood that in 2019 LLA’s total GHG emissions stood at 1,341,235 tonnes CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent), of which 83.7% were from air traffic movements and around 1.3% were from airport operations. That meant the majority of LLA’s overall GHG emissions came from air traffic movements. We further understood that this figure did not include non-CO2 emissions such as soot particles, nitrogen oxide and water contrails from air traffic movements. As noted above, people would understand the main source of emissions from LLA’s expanded operations would come from additional air traffic movements, and so they would likely expect environmental limits on carbon emissions to include those derived from that source. They would therefore not expect those emissions to have been omitted from the Green Controlled Growth Framework’s limits.

The headline claim stated “FREE RANGE AND HAPPY, NATURAL GOODNESS STARTS WITH OUR HENS”. Further text below included “We work hard every day to keep all our free-range hens happy. Giving them acres of field to explore, foliage and trees to play in and only picking the very best farmers to work with.

Like perching, sheltering or having a catch up. And, because hens love cleaning their feathers, we include dust baths on all our farms.”" ;
                                                                                           <https://www.michaeldebellis.com/climate_obstruction/assessment> "Not upheld The website included the claims “Free Range and Happy, Natural Goodness Starts with our hens. We work hard to keep all our free-range hens happy. Giving them acres of field to explore, foliage and trees to play in” and “All of our farms exceed free-range standards in the UK as set by the RSPCA Farm assurance scheme, Freedom Foods”. The ASA considered that those claims, together with the brand name “Happy Egg Co.”, would be understood by consumers to mean that the hens which supplied Happy Egg Co.’s eggs were free range and able to enjoy access to open space and greenery and that they lived in conditions which exceeded the RSPCA’s free-range standards with regard to the space to which they had access. We also considered that the imagery shown of hens surrounded by greenery and open space on the website contributed to that impression. We understood that having tree cover was important for hens’ welfare because trees were considered by the RSPCA to be effective in encouraging range use and foraging behaviours in free-range laying hens. PETA believed that consumers would understand the claims and visual depictions, as well as the branding “Happy Egg Co.”, to mean that hens on farms which supplied Happy Egg Co.’s eggs were able to stretch, roam, forage and dust bathe, and had easy access to green grass and freedom from overcrowding and stress. They had inspected three supplier farms between 15 September and 26 October 2020 and shared video footage of the farms, which showed a large number of hens inside sheds within confined spaces, open, barren space next to sheds with no foliage or greenery where hens were roaming, several hens missing feathers and one hen with a cut on its skin, faeces inside sheds, several dead hens, and scenes of other hens pecking a dead hen. They believed the footage indicated that the farms inspected did not exceed, and in some cases failed to meet, RSPCA Assured Farm standards in relation to food and water contamination, facilitation of movement between different tiers of the shed, provision of adequate enrichment, encouragement of birds to use the outdoor areas, provision of adequate vegetation cover, and frequency of inspections. We noted that two of the farms were reinstated the next day after an inspection showed they had met RSPCA Assured Farm standards and that the third farm was also reinstated by the RSPCA after two weeks, having undertaken a number of remedial actions. While one of the farms was determined by the RSPCA to have failed their Assured Farm standards, we did not consider that was in itself indicative that Happy Egg Co. supplier farms did not meet those standards. We understood that beak trimming was currently permitted under the RSPCA’s Assured Farm standards, as prohibiting it could lead to injurious pecking and have a negative welfare impact on some flocks. We looked at the audit list supplied by Happy Egg Co. and understood that their supplier farms were subject to eight different audits at various frequencies, five of which were internal audits and three of which were external audits. Happy Egg Co. carried out a Regional Management Team farm visit every ten weeks, a Subscriber Lion audit every six months, a tree audit every two years, a food safety protocol assessment every six months and an Environmental audit annually. An RSPCA assured audit was carried out annually, an Animal & Plant Health Agency audit was carried out annually, and a Lion Code audit was carried out every 18 months. The example questionnaire for each farm inspected included various questions, such as the conditions of the farm, flock health, feather conditions of hens, litter conditions, enrichments, environmental conditions, range conditions including whether shelters were within 20 metres of the shed, and the procedure in place for dead hens. We also looked at the Range Management Policy document which set out various requirements including total range area, percentage of area with natural cover, decontamination and sanitisation procedures, fencing, range shelters, range management, and paddock rotation. We considered that this information demonstrated that there were comprehensive measures in place to ensure that all of the Happy Egg Co.’s supplier farms provided hens with access to outdoor spaces and greenery, and satisfied the RSPCA Assured Farm standards for free-range hens.We noted that Happy Egg Co. stated that they encouraged their suppliers to use the activity kits they had developed to enhance hens’ stimulation and natural behaviours. It was not clear whether those kits were of a standard that exceeded the minimum requirements for enrichment activities set by the RSPCA, or what proportion of supplier farms used them in practice. However, we noted that all of the supplier farms of Happy Egg Co. exceeded the 5% natural cover requirement set out by RSPCA welfare standards for laying hens, as referred to by PETA and Happy Egg Co. to determine RSPCA Assured Farm status, with the vast majority having at least 20% natural cover. We considered that demonstrated that the farms exceeded RSPCA Assured Farm minimum standards with regard to the nature of the outdoor space that was provided to hens to roam. We concluded that the claims “Free Range and Happy, Natural Goodness Starts with our hens. We work hard to keep all our free-range hens happy. Giving them acres of field to explore, foliage and trees to play in” and “All of our farms exceed free-range standards in the UK as set by the RSPCA Farm assurance scheme, Freedom Foods”, as consumers were likely to understand them in context, had been substantiated and were not misleading. We investigated the ad under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules3.13.1Marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so.(Misleading advertising),3.73.7Before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation.

They had to be approved by the British Egg Industry Council (BEIC), the government Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and be certified as an RSPCA Assured farm before they could apply to be a Happy Egg supplier. RSPCA Assured Farm status was determined by meeting standards set out in a document entitled “RSPCA Welfare standards for laying hens”. As an initial step, Happy Egg Co. searched BEIC's database to ensure a prospective supplier was BEIC approved and inspected the prospective supplier's RSPCA certificate to ensure it was an RSPCA Assured farm. An initial farm visit was then conducted by a member of their in-house Agriculture Management Team to assess the farm against a list of core criteria, such as hens' feather condition, flocks' general health, range conditions, and availability of shelters. An RSPCA Assured farm was required to have at least 5% \"natural cover\" in place, which included trees and foliage. However, they required all potential suppliers to have a suitable plan in place to achieve a higher percentage of natural cover, in excess of the RSPCA's minimum standards. Therefore, as part of their initial visit, a tree audit was also completed to identify any additional planting that might be required in the current or next planting season and the plan was agreed with the potential supplier. They said that they also encouraged all potential suppliers to use their Happy Egg play kits, and they provided images of wooden structures which they said provided additional shelter for hens, and agreed their allocation with the potential supplier. They also provided an example questionnaire which they completed for each farm they inspected. Following their visit to a potential supplier, a report was completed, an example of which they provided. The report outlined various questions including feather and flock health conditions, litter conditions, enrichments, and range conditions. They then assessed the overall results and graded the farm as \"Red\", \"Amber\" or \"Green\". The “Green” standard was required to qualify as an approved supplier for Happy Egg. If a potential supplier met their requirements, they then planned the farm's transition to adopt their bespoke Happy Egg feed before the supplier could be integrated into the Happy Egg supply network. The supplier could begin supplying eggs ten days after the delivery of Happy Egg feed, to allow time for nutrient uptake by the birds. Once suppliers were approved, they were subject to eight different types of audit carried out at varying frequencies to ensure they maintained the required standard, some of which could be unannounced, including by the RSPCA. Those organisations, or the suppliers themselves, made Happy Egg Co. aware of any issues found during such audits. They provided a list of audits and their frequency. All of their suppliers were certified as free-range by the APHA, which imposed a minimum standard that laying hens did not have their access to open air runs restricted for a continuous period of more than 16 weeks. Their bespoke Happy Egg feed was fortified with vitamins, and contained 28% more Vitamin D per 100 g than standard eggs. They also promoted hens' happiness through Happy Egg play kits and dust baths to clean their feathers. They said that the RSPCA welfare standards for laying hens stated that for birds aged 21 weeks and older, stocking density should not exceed 2,000 hens per hectare over the life of the flock and 2,500 hens per hectare at any one time. All their suppliers complied with the RSPCA Standards and provided access to at least one hectare or 2.47 acres of range per 2,000 hens. This was checked and recorded during audit visits. Based on their latest audit data, they said that the average stocking density at their supplier farms was 1,973 birds per hectare and that each hen, on average, had 5.07 square metres of space on the range. The RSPCA standards also required that for birds aged under 21 weeks, the range area should provide at least one square metre per bird at all times and they said that all of their suppliers complied with that. Hens had free access to the range throughout the day and the number of hens using it could vary from farm to farm, dependant on weather conditions, though there was usually a greater percentage of a flock using a range in the afternoon and evening. The use of a range by hens combined with prolonged periods of wet weather led to poached areas of ground, and prolonged dry periods of weather combined with heavy bird footfall could wear down the grass and lead to a dry and dusty appearance. Their suppliers followed Happy Egg Co.’s and third-parties' range management programmes to re-establish worn areas.Happy Egg Co. said that hens were housed indoors at night to protect them from predators. The RPSCA Standards required that all RSPCA Assured farms provided birds with access to at least 5% natural cover whilst out on the range, which comprised existing or newly-planted trees, shrubs or other canopy forming plants. Happy Egg Co. said that all of their supplier farms provided hens with more than 5% natural cover, with 86% of hens having access to ranges with more than 20% natural cover, 12% having access to 10-19% and 2% having access to 5-9%. They carried out additional tree assessments and counted them to ensure compliance, and could provide us with their database if required. They provided a copy of their Range Management Policy document. They said that they were aware that People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals had inspected three farms that supplied eggs to The Happy Egg Co. and that they lodged complaints with the RSPCA concerning the treatment of hens at those farms. Upon receipt of those complaints the RSPCA suspended the farms' membership to the RSPCA Assured farm scheme whilst investigations were made and the RSPCA informed them of the allegations. They said that they immediately suspended the three suppliers from the Happy Egg pool and launched their own investigation which ran alongside that of the RSPCA. The RSPCA investigated all three farms but after a rigorous physical inspection they reinstated two of the farms the next day, after concluding that they already met the RSPCA Assured farm standards. A third farm was subjected to a longer two-week investigation and required to take some remedial actions, after which it was also reinstated by the RSPCA. The Happy Egg Co. then conducted their own audits of the farms to ensure they met their own enhanced standards. The farms were reinstated as approved suppliers once they were satisfied those standards had been met. Happy Egg Co. said that this process illustrated the effectiveness of their safeguarding measures. They provided video footage of one of their supplier's farms, as well as images of three of their supplier farms from May 2021, which they said depicted the hens' environment." ;

The lawsuit is based, among other things, on Brazilian environmental law concerning the constitutional protection of the environment, the accusation of deforestation, propter rem civil liability for environmental damage, including climate damage, and collective moral damages. It also mentions the unauthorized emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) caused by the illegal deforestation of the area, calculated at 77,296.03 tons of carbon dioxide and which are directly related to the Brazilian State's departure from its climate goals, out of step with national and international commitments made by Brazil in the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009) and in the Paris Agreement (promulgated by Federal Decree 9.073/2017).

The underside of the plane was represented by an image of the earth from space. The ad included text which stated, “LUFTHANSA GROUP. CONNECTING THE WORLD. PROTECTING ITS FUTURE. #MakeChangeFly”.
The Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) challenged whether the ad gave a misleading impression of Lufthansa’s environmental impact.
By ruling of March 1, 2023, the ASA upheld that challenge.
The CAP Code required that absolute environmental claims be supported by a high level of substantiation.
The claim “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” was likely to be interpreted by consumers as an environmental reference to how Lufthansa's approach to aviation was protecting the future of the world. Further, it was likely to be understood to mean Lufthansa had already taken significant mitigating steps to ensure that the net environmental impact of their business was not harmful.
However air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. Many of the initiatives Lufthansa said they were committed to delivering were targeted to deliver results only years or decades into the future. There were currently no environmental initiatives or commercially viable technologies in the aviation industry which would substantiate the absolute green claim “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE”, as consumers would interpret it.
The basis of the claim had therefore not been made clear and it had not been adequately substantiated, meaning the ad breached the Code.
The ASA told Lufthansa to ensure that the basis of future environmental claims was made clear and did not give a misleading impression of the impact caused by travelling with the airline, and that robust substantiation was held to support future claims""" ;

A person wearing a black hooded coat stepped into view close to the camera, pulled out a semi-automatic rifle and began shooting at the pink-coated figure. Slow motion close-ups showed bullet holes appearing in the coat. The black-hooded individual walked whilst firing, towards the pink-coated figure, changing magazines before pulling out a pistol and continuing to fire. A close-up of the pink-coated figure revealed that it was a mannequin. Further shots destroyed the mannequin’s head while a short scream was heard. The black-hooded individual walked away, towards a building with a corrugated iron roof, showing the ThruDark logo on the back of the coat. They then turned back, pulled out a shotgun that was hidden under the coat and began firing again. Large holes appeared in the mannequin’s head and torso and its head fell off. The black-hooded individual finally walked away and the video cut to a black screen with the text “There can be only one”, followed by ThruDark’s logo. Throughout the ad, classical music was played in the background. The video’s caption stated “‘There can be only one.’ #shroud #thrudark #endeavourthroughadversity”." ;

Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. It further stated that marketing communications must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence and that particular care must be taken to avoid causing offence on the grounds of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability or age. The ad depicted a black-hooded figure repeatedly shooting at a figure wearing a pink coat. The ASA noted that the distinctive colouring of its coat was particularly prominent against the otherwise gloomy colour-scheme. While we agreed that colours were not inherently gendered, we considered that pink was culturally associated with femininity in the UK. In that context, we considered that the simplistic imagery of the stark contrast between the black and pink figures visually alluded to the figures being, respectively, male and female. A close-up of the mannequin’s delicate facial features, which when surrounded by the pink hood we considered would be read as feminine, further enhanced this contrast with the black-hooded figure. We considered that viewers would interpret the ad as alluding to a man shooting and killing a woman or as practising and preparing for a similar scenario. We considered that the ad glamorised and condoned that scenario and was unlikely to be understood as a parody. Rather than suggesting a comedic tone, we considered the use of gentle classical music, with slow-motion emphasis on the damage inflicted on the mannequin, added an eerie tone to the ad. We also considered only a small proportion of the ad’s audience were likely to recognise the “Wilhem scream” and be aware of its background. We therefore concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious and widespread offence, that it condoned and encouraged violence against women, and was irresponsible. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.4 (Harm and offence). 2. Upheld We understood the ad was intended to promote the changing robe worn by the black-hooded figure. We further understood that ThruDark had a military legacy as its founders had previously served in the UK Special Forces. While the ad was set in an outdoor environment and the brand was focused on outdoor clothing, we understood that the guns shown in the ad were not equipment which would typically be used for sport or legal hunting in the UK. We therefore considered that, in the context of an ad from a clothing retailer for outerwear, the presence of three semi-automatic firearms was incongruous and jarring. Throughout the ad, the black-hooded figure repeatedly fired at the mannequin using a semi-automatic rifle, pistol and shotgun, until its head fell off. We considered that the particular weapons used, and the relentless shooting at the target, displayed an extreme level of violence which, as referenced above, would not be interpreted as a comedic parody. Although we accepted that the inclusion of a gun in an ad would not always be irresponsible, we considered that the use of multiple guns (and the particular weapons used), in an ad which promoted an item of outerwear, together with the focus on the guns’ destructive capacity and the added emphasis of the slow-motion effect, glamorised guns and gun violence. We therefore concluded that the ad irresponsibly glamorised guns and condoned gun violence and was in breach of the Code. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.4 (Harm and offence)." ;

ThruDark Ltd said they had a proud military heritage and had shown weaponry in previous brand communications and content as a reference to their background. They had established themselves as a brand that was known for their tongue-in-cheek humour and disruptive messaging. They said the ad’s scenario was filmed in good humour and had comedic intention. They had used classical music by Chopin in the background, which they specifically chose to soften and mock the crude nature of the scenario. Additionally, they had used the “Wilhelm scream” stock sound, an inside joke among sound designers, for slapstick comedic effect. They considered that the “Wilhelm scream” was particularly illustrative of the humorous nature of the ad. Some aspects were filmed in slow motion to lessen the sense of realism and heighten the slapstick tone, which was intended to parody the glamorisation of violence frequently shown on television. They considered it was clear from the beginning of the ad that the pink-coated figure was a mannequin. They said it was male in form and did not have feminine facial features, as shown in a “behind the scenes” video shared by a co-founder. They considered that if viewers believed the mannequin was female because it was wearing a pink changing robe, that belief was rooted in the viewer’s own prejudices. They said they had taken positions against the “shrink it and pink it” culture shown by other brands and pointed to previous posts in which they questioned why womenswear was equated with the colour pink. They had used the colour pink because that was the most radical visual departure from their signature black branding and it was the first, brightest-coloured robe they had to hand. They had consistently spoken out against brightly coloured clothing given their background in night operations as part of elite military units. They also did not consider that the black robe would be assumed to indicate the male gender. In the context of the music, comedy sound effects and slow motion, the contrast in the colour of the robes portrayed a fantastical battle between light and dark. The slogan “There can only be one” was a clear reference to the changing robe comparison. It also referenced the cult 1980s fantasy film Highlander, reinforcing the sense of fantastical battle. On the use of guns during the ad, they stated that the simple presence of a gun was not, in and of itself, evidence of a particular stance on gun usage. They said ads for violent action films, children’s toy guns and clay pigeon shooting were permissible on social media platforms. They considered the presence of weapons in the ad was in keeping with their brand’s military heritage and identity. They said that the ad was not irresponsible, because the actions took place in a secure firing range by a highly trained former UK Special Forces operator, and the use of an inanimate object minimised any potential risk of harm. They considered that it was clear that the location was a firing range and not a field because of the target stations, sand bank and covered firing positions. They also said that public disclaimers were messaged at the time. They believed it was not relevant that the firearms used were semi-automatic, but highlighted that the use of semi-automatic weapons would typically be considered to be less extreme than the use of automatic weapons.The ad did not include any form of encouragement or incitement of violence against minority groups, or anti-social behaviour. The ad was in line with their military heritage and was overall well received by the 350,000 people who had viewed it. In their view, the 11 complaints reflected the internalised biases of the complainants and did not evidence that the ad caused serious or widespread offence or was irresponsible. Meta said that they investigated the matter and had restricted the ad from appearing in the United Kingdom." ;

The MPF alleges that the defendant unlawfully occupied land within an Agroextractivist Settlement Project (PAE), federal property managed by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and occupied by traditional extractivist communities. This ACP is one of 22 actions brought by the MPF following an investigation under Civil Inquiry No. 1.13.000.001719/2015-49 into illegal deforestation in the Antimary Agroextractivist Settlement Project, though involving different defendants.

The MPF bases its legal arguments on Brazilian Environmental Law, emphasizing constitutional protections for the environment, civil liability propter rem for environmental damages (including climate-related damages), and collective moral damages. The MPF also highlights the environmental liability associated with unauthorized greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from deforestation, estimated at 510,046.20 tons of carbon dioxide. These emissions allegedly contribute to Brazil’s deviation from its climate goals, violating the National Policy on Climate Change (Federal Law 12,187/2009) and the Paris Agreement.

The ACP includes the following key requests: (i) reversal of the burden of proof from the outset; (ii) immediate cessation of activities causing ongoing damage; (iii) restoration of the environment to its original state or, alternatively, payment of compensation aimed at environmental restitution; (iv) compensation for interim and residual environmental material damages; (v) compensation for climate-related damages; and (vi) compensation for collective moral damages.

In March 2022, the defendant submitted a defense, denying responsibility for the deforestation and disputing the existence of collective moral damages. The defendant requested the dismissal of the action.""" ;
