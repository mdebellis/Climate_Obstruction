To determine the status of EUAs, the Court applied a three-part test identified in Re Celtic Extraction.  In order for EUAs to be considered property, there must be statutory framework conferring an entitlement on their holder to an exemption from a fine, the “property” must be transferable under a statutory framework, and the “property” must have value.

When the authorities failed to respond, Shrestha petitioned the Supreme Court of Nepal to issue a writ of mandamus or other appropriate order to enact such a law. According to the petition, the Environmental Protection Act of 1997 was inadequate because it did not address climate change, the Climate Change Policy of 2011 had not been implemented, and as a result, the humans and ecosystems of Nepal had experienced grave climate impacts. Shrestha alleged that the government’s failure to adequately address climate had violated the rights to a dignified life and a healthy environment guaranteed in the Constitution of Nepal, and violated Nepal’s commitments under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. The existential threat created by climate change impaired his constitutional rights to (i) live with dignity, (ii) live in a healthy and clean environment, (iii) access basic healthcare services, and (iv) food and protection from starvation.

Mexico, through the National Agency for Industrial Security and Environmental Protection in the Hydrocarbon Sector (ASEA) and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), adopted its national guidelines for the integral prevention and control of methane emissions from the hydrocarbon sector as a way to implement this decision. The guidelines stipulate that any entity or person regulated by ASEA, like private companies or state-owned companies in the hydrocarbon sector, must establish a program for the monitoring, prevention, and control of methane emissions for both new and existing facilities. Originally, the guidelines ordered regulated entities to draft their programs within 12 months of the beginning of operations for new facilities or those still under construction and within 12 months of the guideline’s coming into force for existing facilities. The new guidelines gave regulated entities a 3-month period to turn in their respective programs after they were drafted. However, in June 2020, the 3-month period outlined previously was expanded to 19 months.

The Agreement established that that the intermittency of renewable energy projects jeopardized the reliability of the National Electric System. As such, it ordered CENACE to limit the operation of intermittent energy projects and to suspend and reject pre-operational trials of intermittent wind and photovoltaic power plants in the process of commercial operation.","Whether The Agreement and its Annex to guarantee the efficiency, quality, reliability, continuity, and security of the National Electric System in light of the SARS-CoV2 (COVID 19) pandemic transgressed the right to a healthy environment and constitutes a setback on energy transition goals.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210419_Amparo-1862021_judgment.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20211104_Amparo-1862021_decision.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/idheas-litigio-estrategico-v-centro-nacional-de-control-de-energia-cenace-and-secretaria-de-energia-sener

Rules relating to the provisional assignment of credits for new installations also found to be contrary to the implementing statute because they effectively altered the definition of “new entrants” in the statute.

The accompanying press release stated that due to the “UK’s over-delivery on reducing emissions” there was “space to take a more pragmatic, proportionate, and realistic approach to reaching net zero...”. A number of policy changes were announced. The 2030 ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars was delayed to 2035. Policies requiring landlords to upgrade the energy efficiency of their properties were dropped. And the ban on new fossil fuel boilers for certain households was delayed.
On December 1, 2023, environmentalist and TV personality Chris Packham announced a public law challenge to these decisions. The grounds of claim are:
• The obligation under Section 13 Climate Change Act 2008 to have proposals and policies to meet carbon budgets is continuing and the proposals and policies must be current. If they are altered, there must always be plans in place to meet the budgets. The secretaries of state breached this obligation.
• There was a failure to take into account considerations listed under Section 10 of the Climate Change Act, such as the risk to delivery of proposals and policies and to the achievement of the carbon budgets and the 2050 net zero target.
• There was a failure to consult on the changes, particularly a failure to take into account ongoing consultations about off-grid heating and minimum energy efficiency in rental properties
• The decisions were based on misinformation
• There was a breach of the duty to inform the public of the reasons for the decisions to change the policies",Whether the government's 'new approach to Net Zero’ announced in September 2023 is legal.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231201_22915_press-release.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230920_22915_press-release-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230920_22915_press-release-2.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/rpackham-v-secretary-of-state-for-energy-security-and-net-zero-and-secretary-of-state-for-transport-challenge-to-the-new-approach-to-net-zero

R(Friends of the Earth Ltd) v Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero; ClientEarth v SSESNZ; Good Law Project v SSESNZ (challenges to the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan),2023,,Pending,"Suits against governments, GHG emissions reduction and trading, Other","United Kingdom, England and Wales, High Court of Justice","United Kingdom, Climate Change Act 2008","In June 2021, the UK’s sixth carbon budget was set, covering the period 2033 to 2037. In November 2021 the government published its strategy for meeting that and the other preceding carbon budgets. However that strategy was held to be in breach of the Climate Change Act 2008 - R(Friends of the Earth, ClientEarth and Good Law Project) v SSBEIS [2022] EWHC 1841 (Admin). The court ordered government to revise its strategy to correct the legal errors identified. That revised strategy – the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan – was published in March 2023. However that too was challenged on public law grounds in claims brought by Friends of the Earth, ClientEarth and the Good Law Project.
Friends of the Earth’s challenge raises grounds under both section 13 and section 14 of the Climate Change Act. Under section 13, Friends of the Earth argue that the Secretary of State did not consider delivery risk in a lawful way, and that there was no legally sufficient basis for the Secretary of State to conclude that the proposals and policies “will enable” the carbon budgets to be met. Further, Friends of the Earth argue that the Secretary of State unlawfully failed to put forward proposals that “must” contribute to sustainable development. Under section 14, Friends of the Earth argue that the Plan unlawfully does not include information obviously material to the critical issue of risk to the delivery of the carbon budgets.
Good Law Project's challenge focuses on the government's refusal to include a proper assessment of the delivery risk associated with each of the policies and proposals in the Plan. Good Law Project argue that this is unlawful because it is a breach of section 14 , which requires the Secretary of State to publish sufficient information to allow meaningful scrutiny of the government’s net zero policies.
ClientEarth’s challenge focuses on the government’s failure to have regard to considerations that are legally essential under section 13, related to the risks of its plans not delivering the emissions savings required to meet the UK’s climate targets. ClientEarth also argues that the government’s assumption that the projected emissions savings from its policies will be delivered ‘in full’ was not rational having regard to the government’s own assessment of delivery risks to key policies.

MOEA's Regulation for Large Power Consumers entered into force on January 1, 2020 and requires large consumers to transition 10% of their contracted capacity to renewable energy. Plaintiffs challenge two aspects of the regulations. They argue that the regulations improperly applied only to 10% of contracted capacity, rather than 20% of actual consumption; and the regulations improperly raised the threshold for who qualifies as a large power consumer to 5,000kWh, exempting 90% of large company consumers. Plaintiffs argue that the defects are in violation of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act and the Renewable Energy Development Act, which set a 20% renewable energy goal by 2025. Plaintiffs seek a court order for the MOEA to amend the Regulation for Large Power Consumers.

Thomson v. Minister for Climate Change Issues,2015,[2017] NZHC 733,Decided,"Suits against governments, GHG emissions reduction and trading, Other","New Zealand, High Court of New Zealand","New Zealand, Climate Change Response Act 2002","Sarah Thomson, a New Zealand law student, filed a Statement of Claim in 2015 against New Zealand’s Minister of Climate Change Issues alleging that the Minister had failed in several respects regarding the setting of greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets required by New Zealand’s Climate Change Response Act of 2002. That Act implements New Zealand’s responsibilities as a ratifying Annex I member of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It requires the Minister to set an emissions reduction target in keeping with the statements of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and to consider whether to revise that target as the IPCC issues updated findings. In March 2011, pursuant to the 2002 Act, the Minister had set a target of 50% reduction from 1990 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels by 2050. The Minister did not review or revise that target following the 2014 issuance of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report. In July 2015, in advance of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Paris, the Minister submitted New Zealand’s intended nationally determined contribution (INDC)--and then subsequently a nationally determined contribution (NDC)--consistent with a “provisional target” of only 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030. As Thomson's Statement of Claim noted, “this equates to a reduction of 11% below New Zealand’s 1990 emission levels by 2030,” and thus “will not, if adopted by other developed countries in combination with appropriate targets set by developing countries, stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” Thus Thompson challenged both the target set pursuant to the 2002 law and the target set as part of New Zealand's NDC pursuant to the United National Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, both ratified by New Zealand.",Challenge to Minister's target for greenhouse gas emission reductions,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2015/20151110_2017-NZHC-733_complaint-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20171102_2017-NZHC-733_decision-1.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/thomson-v-minister-for-climate-change-issues

The European Court of Justice (CJEU) found that under Directive 2003/87/EZ, penalties for failure to surrender credits still apply even if the entity held a sufficient number of allowances at that time.

Ontario alleged that Parliament exceeded its constitutional authority in passing the GGPPA, arguing that the GGPPA is not authorized by the “national concern branch of the peace, order, and good government power” because the provinces are capable of regulating greenhouse gas emissions themselves and that “there is no need to expand the scope of federal jurisdiction to impose a one-size-fits-all federal carbon price.” Ontario further argues that even if the GGPPA falls within the scope of a national concern, the GGPPA represents an unconstitutional tax because it does not provide an adequate nexus between the charges it imposes and its regulatory purpose.",Whether the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act passed by the national government is constitutional,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180913_C65807_points-of-claim-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20181130_C65807_complaint.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2019/20190628_C65807_decision.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/ontario-v-canada

The action challenges Law 14.182/2021, which deals with the privatization of the national electricity company Eletrobras and promotes changes in the Brazilian electricity sector regime. The law derived from a provisional measure, which can only be adopted in exceptional circumstances. The plaintiffs argue that the provisional measure, which was then turned into the law in question, lacked the requirement of urgency, circumventing the regular legislative process. They claim that, when considering the conversion of the provisional measure, the National Congress approved amendments that resulted in substantial changes to Brazilian energy planning. The final wording of the provisions reveals an undue attempt to prevent a possible veto by the President of the Republic. The Law, under the terms approved, requires the mandatory contracting of energy from small hydroelectric power plants and natural gas thermoelectric plants. The plaintiffs argue that such a requirement makes the necessary decarbonization of the Brazilian energy matrix more distant and will lead to an increase in annual greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), in breach of the commitments made under the Paris Agreement and by the President of the Republic at COP26. The plaintiffs point out that the enactment of the Law violates the legal and constitutional order since it is contrary to the duty to act in favor of the protection of intact and stable climatic conditions.

They invoke that the Portuguese State adopted in 2021 a Climate Framework Law (i.e., Law no. 98/2021, of 31 December 2021), according to which the Portuguese State, until February 1, 2023, had an obligation to adopt several measures (including to enact laws and other political acts) aimed at achieving the GHG emissions reduction goal of 55% until 2030, in comparison with the emissions values of 2005.
These measures include the adoption of the carbon budgets for 2023/2025 and 2025/2030; a report of assessment of climate impact of the legislation in force; the regulation of the climate risk and impact of financial products; an amendment to the rules in relation to corporate governance; an amendment to the legal regime on the exploration for, and exploitation of, hydrocarbons.

Where the exporting country was not a member of the European Union, the exemption was available only if there was a prior agreement between the importing and exporting countries regarding recognition of guarantees of origin. When Green Network requested an exemption from its obligation to purchase green certificates, the Italian national grid manager rejected that request since there was no agreement regarding guarantees of origin between Italy and Switzerland at the time the renewable energy was imported. Green Network brought an action in administrative court, which was dismissed.

The complaint was lodged after two letters were sent to the Swedish state, one in May 2022 (to which the sitting Minister for Climate and Environment replied) and one in November 2022 following a change in government in October 2022 (to which there was no reply), where the plaintiffs outlined their requests. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the risk of the negative impacts of climate change constitutes interferences with their rights to life, private and family life, and non-discrimination under articles 2, 8, and 14 of the ECHR, respectively, as well as the right to property under article 1, protocol 1 of the ECHR. These interferences are argued to constitute rights violations since Sweden is failing to do its fair share to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration in the atmosphere to keep warming below 1.5°C as compared to pre-industrial levels, by not undertaking immediate and adequate procedural and substantive measures to continuously reduce GHG emissions and enhance GHG sinks, thus failing to adequately protect the plaintiffs from adverse impacts of anthropogenic climate change. In particular, the plaintiffs argue that climate change impacts in the period leading up to 2100 will be serious, especially in relation to impacts on human health, and that they are expected to be particularly affected by these impacts because expect to be alive at that time, based on the average life span in Sweden. In terms of specific impacts, the plaintiffs cite longer and more intense heatwaves causing both mild and severe health effects, shorter and more temperate winters leading to the increased spread of diseases through ticks, and changes to precipitation patterns leading to health impacts stemming from flooding, among others.","The adequacy of Sweden’s climate change mitigation policy, in possible violation of human rights protected by the ECHR.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220510_18245_na.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221107_18245_na.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221125_18245_application.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221125_18245_na.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220601_18245_na.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/anton-foley-and-others-v-sweden-aurora-case

The plaintiffs request Russian authorities to take measures that will reduce the country’s greenhouse emissions, in line with targets of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C agreed under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Russia is currently the fourth biggest producer of carbon emissions worldwide, and need to reduce 31% of its 1991 levels to meet the 2030 goal of the Paris Accords.

The 123 plaintiffs are members of the civil society organization, leaders of political parties, and general citizens affected by climate change. The claimed rights include right to life, right to pursue happiness, right to general freedom, right to property, right to healthy environment, State’s obligation to provide its people from disasters, and State’s obligation to protect the fundamental rights of the people.
The plaintiffs argue the 35% threshold set by the provision of the law (i) depletes South Korea’s per-capita-based carbon budget for 1.5 degrees and 1.7 degrees before 2030, (ii) falls short of the global reduction pathway presented in the IPCC 1.5 Special Report, and (iii) contributes to the Emission Gap pointed out by the UNEP. The plaintiffs further argue that the provision of the law does not prescribe the specific standards and criteria for delegation as required by the Constitution.

The court concluded that the state has a duty to take climate change mitigation measures due to the “severity of the consequences of climate change and the great risk of climate change occurring.” In reaching this conclusion, the court cited (without directly applying) Article 21 of the Dutch Constitution; EU emissions reduction targets; principles under the European Convention on Human Rights; the “no harm” principle of international law; the doctrine of hazardous negligence; the principle of fairness, the precautionary principle, and the sustainability principle embodied in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; and the principle of a high protection level, the precautionary principle, and the prevention principle embodied in the European climate policy. The court did not specify how the government should meet the reduction mandate, but offered several suggestions, including emissions trading or tax measures. This is the first decision by any court in the world ordering states to limit greenhouse gas emissions for reasons other than statutory mandates.",Seeking declaratory judgment and injunction to compel the Dutch government to reduce GHG emissions,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2015/20150624_2015-HAZA-C0900456689_decision-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20181009_2015-HAZA-C0900456689_decision-3.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20181009_2015-HAZA-C0900456689_decision-4.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2019/20190108_2015-HAZA-C0900456689_appeal-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2019/20190412_2015-HAZA-C0900456689_appeal-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2019/20190913_2015-HAZA-C0900456689_opinion.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2019/20190913_2015-HAZA-C0900456689_opinion-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2019/20191220_2015-HAZA-C0900456689_judgment-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200113_2015-HAZA-C0900456689_judgment.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/urgenda-foundation-v-kingdom-of-the-netherlands

The NGO argued that the NDC failed to respect the principle of non-regression in human rights law. In its original 2015 NDC, Mexico committed to a 22% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 as compared to 2000 levels. In the revised NDC presented in December 2020, Mexico raised the baseline against which the GHG emission reduction is measured. Greenpeace argued that the updated NDC would effectively cause the additional emission of 14 million tons of CO2e; (ii) eliminate the peak of GHG emissions stipulated for 2026; (iii) rule out the 50% reduction target for 2050, which would nullify the mitigation horizon in the medium and long term.

On the basis of the monitoring, the Government shall, if necessary, decide on the additional measures required to achieve the targets.“ The new Climate Change Act sets a target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2035 – a target recommended by Finland’s Climate Council. With the new law, there is now a legal obligation to reach carbon neutrality by 2035. However, the collapse of Finland’s carbon sinks in 2021 has created a situation where the government’s climate policy plans are insufficient for meeting the Climate Act’s targets. The reason is due to the intensive forest logging and the slowing down of forest growth that has become a source of greenhouse emissions.",Whether the Finnish government has ignored its commitments to mitigate GHG emissions under Finnish law.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230607_18412_judgment.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230607_18412_judgment-2.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/finnish-association-for-nature-conservation-and-greenpeace-v-finland

Turp v. Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada,2012,2012 FC 893,Decided,"Suits against governments, GHG emissions reduction and trading, Kyoto Protocol",,"Canada, Kyoto Protocol Implementation Act, 2007","Daniel Turp sought judicial review of Canada’s decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. He alleged that the Conservative-led Government could not do without some form of authorization from Parliament. Underlying this dispute and Canada’s ambivalent commitment to Kyoto was the fact that Canada was led from 2004 to 2015 by Governments elected with either a razor-thin majority of seats or reliant for their majority position on a coalition of parties. Canada had signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998 and ratified it in 2002. A Conservative Government entered into power in 2006, shortly after the Protocol entered into effect in 2005. When that Government made clear that it would not pursue greenhouse gas emissions reductions adequate to comply with Kyoto, a member of parliament proposed a private bill—i.e., proposed legislation not put forward by the government—requiring compliance with the Protocol, which became known as the Kyoto Protocol Implementation Act (KPIA). About a month after Canada gave notice of its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol in December 2011, the applicant, Turp, sought judicial review of that decision. Between his filing and issuance of the court’s opinion, Parliament repealed the KPIA.",Challenge Canadian Government's withdrawal from Kyoto Protocol,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2012/20120717_2012-FC-893_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/turp-v-minister-of-justice-and-attorney-general-of-canada

"Marks and Spencer PLC v Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities",2023,,Decided,"Suits against governments, GHG emissions reduction and trading, Other","United Kingdom, England and Wales, High Court of Justice","United Kingdom, Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (England and Wales)","This challenge concerned Marks and Spencer’s flagship London store. In July 2023, the Secretary of State refused planning permission for its demolition and replacement with a new mixed office and retail store. The claimant brought a public law challenge.
In March 2024, the High Court upheld that challenge, thus quashing the refusal of planning permission.
One ground of challenge concerned the Secretary of State’s finding that there was a ""strong presumption in favour of repurposing buildings"", which was “reflected” in the following paragraph of the National Planning Policy Framework:
""152. The planning system should support the transition to a low carbon future in a changing climate, taking full account of flood risk and coastal change. It should help to: shape places in ways that contribute to radical reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, minimise vulnerability and improve resilience; encourage the reuse of existing resources, including the conversion of existing buildings; and support renewable and low carbon energy and associated infrastructure.""
The Secretary of State had misinterpreted this policy, and so erred in law. Whilst there was some encouragement for the reuse of buildings, there was nothing close to a presumption. (Judgment, paragraphs 54 to 57.)
A further ground related to the Secretary of State’s approach to ""embodied carbon"". Again, the Secretary of State had misinterpreted planning policy, this time in the London Plan. That policy stated “Major development should be net zero” and included a carbon offsetting requirement. However that related to the operational phase. It did not relate to the embodied carbon in the construction phase. The Secretary of State had misinterpreted the policy on this point, and in the process appears to have become “thoroughly confused”. The court stressed the importance in making clear that this case was not about whether or not it would be appropriate or justified to have such a policy in the light of the climate emergency. Such a judgement is not the function of the court. The issue for the court was whether the Secretary of State erred in law by misinterpreting policy. (Judgment 113 to 124.)",The legality of the refusal of planning permission for the demolition and rebuilding of Marks and Spencer’s flagship London store.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2024/20240103_67115_judgment.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/marks-and-spencer-plc-v-secretary-of-state-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities

It repealed the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-Carbon Economy Act, which had established an emission reduction target of 37% below 2005 levels by 2030 in the province, and implemented a revised target of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. In response, Ecojustice assisted seven youth environmental activists who filed an application against Ontario, contesting the constitutionality of CTCA. The Applicants argued that the revised target did not adequately address the risks associated with climate change, thereby violating the rights of Ontario youth and future generations as protected by sections 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They contended that their section 7 right to life, liberty, and security of the person was infringed due to the perilous and existential threats posed by climate change to the lives and well-being of Ontarians. The Applicants maintained that their section 15 right to equality was violated because the revised target created a distinction based on age, imposing a greater burden on younger Ontarians who would endure the long-term impacts of climate change. They sought a declaration that the revised target was unconstitutional and an order requiring Ontario to establish a revised emissions target grounded in scientific principles, consistent with Ontario’s commitments under the Paris Agreement.",Youth brought suit to challenge Ontario's 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2019/20191125_CV-19-00631627_complaint.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200415_CV-19-00631627_reply.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20201112_CV-19-00631627_decision.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200615_CV-19-00631627_complaint.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200615_CV-19-00631627_complaint-2.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220906_CV-19-00631627_complaint.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230414_CV-19-00631627_judgment.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230515_CV-19-00631627_appeal.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2024/20241017_CV-19-00631627_decision.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/mathur-et-al-v-her-majesty-the-queen-in-right-of-ontario

The application alleges that the UK Government is in breach of their obligations under Articles 2, 3 and 8 of the Convention for failing to address the risks of the climate crisis, future pandemics and antibiotic resistance created by factory farming. This application poses novel climate arguments focusing on the danger of agricultural methane emissions, and highlighting soy feed consumption in UK factory farming as a key driver of deforestation in the Amazon basin. The application also cites for the first time before the ECHR the ruling of the Brazilian Supreme Court in PSB  et al v Brazil (on Climate Fund), which recognized the Paris Agreement as a human rights treaty.

The consent was granted via the A57 LinIn January 2023  the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), Peak District and South Yorkshire branch launched a legal challenge against the Secretary of State for Transport’s decision in November 2022 to grant development consent for a major new dual carriageway known as the trans-Pennine link road. The consent was granted via the A57 Link Roads Development Consent Order 2022.
When making this Order the Transport Secretary accepted the scheme would “result in an increase in carbon emissions” but concluded that the “proposed development is consistent with existing and emerging policy requirements to achieve the UK’s trajectory towards net zero”.
The challenge alleges the Transport Secretary failed to consider the environmental impacts of the scheme, including cumulative carbon emissions.
At the hearing in October 2023, all parties accepted that the above ground was materially the same as the challenge advanced by Dr Boswell in Boswell v Secretary of State for Transport [2023] EWHC 1710 which was dismissed by the High Court. However Dr Boswell had been granted permission to appeal by the Court of Appeal. The parties were in agreement with the court's suggestion that this ground of the present claim be stayed pending a decision from the Court of Appeal in Boswell. Accordingly, no submissions were made on the substance of this at the hearing. In November 2023 a judgment was issued, which recorded the above approach at paragraph 7.

Nordzucker AG,,[2015] C-148/14,Resolved,"Suits against governments, GHG emissions reduction and trading, EU ETS","European Union, European Court of Justice","European Union, Secondary Law, Directives, 2003/87/EC","Nordzucker AG (“Nordzucker”), a sugar refinery operator in Germany, produced an emissions report for 2005 pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC,  part of the European Union’s greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. Nordzucker’s emissions report excluded emissions resulting from steam generation necessary to operate the refinery’s drying facility on the basis of a letter from a German Ministry stating that such facilities were exempted from compulsory emissions trading schemes. An expert verified the report, and Nordzucker surrendered emissions allowances equal to the emissions stated in the report. Subsequently, the German Emissions Trading Authority examined Nordzucker’s emissions report and found that it should have included emissions attributable to the refinery’s drying facility. Nordzucker revised its emissions report and surrendered additional allowances. German authorities found Nordzucker liable for failing to timely surrender emissions allowances and levied a penalty as provided in Article 16(3) of Directive 2003/87. After a series of appeals, the German Federal Administrative Court referred to the European Court of Justice the question whether excess emissions penalties apply where an operator surrenders allowances equal to emissions stated in a verified report, but where the report is later found to understate the operator’s emissions and additional allowances are surrendered. The European Court of Justice found that such penalties should not apply and that, in such cases, national authorities should establish proportionate penalties taking into account relevant factual circumstances.",Determination of proper penalties to be levied for excess emissions under EU’s GHG emissions trading scheme,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2015/20150205_2015-C-14814_opinion.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2015/20150429_2015-C-14814_judgment.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/germany-v-nordzucker-ag
Industrie de bois de Vielsalm & Cie v. Walloon Region,2011,European Court of Justice C-195/12,Decided,,"European Union, European Court of Justice",,"The European Union adopted Directive 2004/8/EC to promote high-efficiency cogeneration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Directive, Member States are to adopt certain supporting mechanisms to encourage cogeneration. In implementing the Directive, Walloon decided to exclude biomass from wood, because of the potentially negative environmental consequences. Industrie de bois de Vielsalm (IBV), which operates a cogeneration plant from sawmill waste, applied to the Walloon Government for green certificates under the support mechanism and was rejected. IBV challenged the refusal arguing that the exclusion of biomass from wood (1) was inconsistent with the Directive and (2) violated the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Constitutional Court of Belgium referred these issues to the EU Court of Justice. The Court of Justice found Walloon's interpretation of biomass was permissible under the Directive given its purpose. Furthermore, the Court found that while Member States were subject to the equal treatment and non-discrimination clauses of EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights in implementing the cogeneration support mechanism, the Walloon Government did not defy those clauses when it excluded wood and wood waste from its biomass support scheme.",Whether the Swiss government's climate change mitigation targets and implementation measures were adequate under EU Directive 2004/8/EC.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2013/20130926_European-Court-of-Justice-C-19512_judgment.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/industrie-de-bois-de-vielsalm-cie-v-walloon-region

The Court, confirming an earlier decision of its advocate general, rejected the claim, holding that the EU has the right to permit a commercial activity, in this instance air transport, to be carried out in its territory only on the condition that operators comply with the criteria that have been established by the EU.  The court rejected the argument by the airlines that the ETS could not apply to flights that mostly take place outside of EU territory.
