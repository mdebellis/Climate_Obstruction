As corporations are increasingly being held accountable for deception of shareholders and the public on climate risk, as authors and journalists explore this history, and as lawmakers investigate it, Climate Investigations Center embarked on a year-long investigation of the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), arguably the most impactful industry group ever to campaign against climate change regulation and science.
As corporations are increasingly being held accountable for deception of shareholders and the public on climate risk, as authors and journalists explore this history, and as lawmakers investigate it, Climate Investigations Center embarked on a year-long investigation of the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), arguably the most impactful industry group ever to campaign against climate change regulation and science.
The United States woke up to climate change in 1988 after extreme weather caused drought across half the country and newsworthy Senate hearings on the science stressed urgent action. In 1989, the Global Climate Coalition, the first industry organization to challenge government action on climate, was launched from the offices of the National Association of Manufacturers, with leadership dominated by coal-vested electric utility interests, fossil fuel companies (oil, coal) and their trade associations, and heavy manufacturing (i.e. steel, aluminum, railroads, and automobiles). The GCC was corporate America’s primary vehicle of climate change science denial and regulatory delay during its existence until 2002.

A.  From GCC’s founding until its dissolution, the industries with the most to lose in a carbon-constrained future were central components to the GCC’s strategy and output.
A.  From GCC’s founding until its dissolution, the industries with the most to lose in a carbon-constrained future were central components to the GCC’s strategy and output.
B.  From the outset, the corporate interests that controlled the central components of the GCC were fossil fuel producers, including coal mining interests and oil companies, and fossil fuel dependent industries, including coal-burning utilities, railroads who moved coal, automobiles, and chemical companies. When the GCC became a standalone non-profit organization in 1995, independent from the National Association of Manufacturers, the membership grew, adding at least 8 new utilities and 7 new oil and coal corporations as members. At the same time, the budget tripled, with tax documents showing three million dollars in corporate and trade association dues in tax years 1996 and 1997, compared to one million dollars in dues from the years 1994 and 1995.

As shown below, coal, oil, and gas interests also dominated the GCC’s Board, the highest level of membership available within the GCC, and the GCC committee largely responsible for the creation of GCC’s climate science denial.

A.  Monitoring and analyzing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) negotiations was the GCC’s primary goal, with documents showing GCC’s “IPCC Tracker Budget” receiving an average of two-and-a-half times more annual funding than any other line-item in the budget, topping $78,000 in 1996. These funds were used for corporate scientists to attend IPCC meetings, GCC’s participation in the IPCC process, and to draft reports synthesizing IPCC findings.

B.  The GCC and its member companies sent large delegations to IPCC meetings, some registered with the UN as “Global Climate Coalition” representatives, while other corporate representatives would register with different business-friendly NGOs – forming one coordinated industry coalition bearing many different names. At the IPCC’s Second Conference of the Parties in 1996, only twenty-eight of the forty-five representatives with ties to the GCC disclosed that relationship. The number of representatives associated with the GCC present at COP-2 was more than two times the typical COP delegation from any one developing country (usually ranging from one to twenty members).

C.  The GCC engaged with the IPCC in bad faith; GCC corporate representatives registered with different organizations to attend the IPCC meeting but would report back to the GCC their efforts, emphasizing IPCC findings that validated the interests of their member corporations and omitting those that did not. Simultaneously, demonstrated in previously unreleased documents, the GCC coordinated an attack on the IPCC process – erroneously targeting scientist Ben Santer through direct communications and public-facing editorials.

A.  The GCC’s rhetoric evolved over time, its early years producing some of its most strident public climate change denial. During this time, examples of the coalition denying anthropogenic climate change and highlighting fringe contrarian theories were commonplace. Despite internal discussions about what they could and couldn’t factually assert, along with small adjustments to the GCC’s talking points, the group continued to proffer doubt and uncertainty around climate science and refer to the same, small group of climate deniers until the group disbanded.

The STAC also shaped the GCC’s carefully worded, strategic denial – shaping the group’s climate positions, emphasizing natural climate variability, questioning the reliability of climate modeling, and diminishing humanity’s role in greenhouse gas emissions.

C.  Despite internal documents and drafts showing the GCC internally acknowledging the legitimacy of anthropogenic climate change while debunking prevailing “contrarian theories” in 1995, the GCC never publicly disclosed their full understanding of climate change science. Instead, it would continue to publicly emphasize factors other than human greenhouse gas emissions, touting the same “contrarian theories” they had internally debated and debunked, as late as 1999.

A.  The GCC influenced international negotiations through engagement with the United States government delegation involved in the negotiations themselves. From just 1996 to 1997, documents show the GCC met with high-ranking government officials on at least ten occasions, supplying the State Department with talking points and GCC-written reports that perpetuated denial and regulatory delay. In those meetings, “[t]he GCC position was one of no need for rushing into any controls [of greenhouse gases].”

VI. GCC Denial of Climate Impacts on Human Health","heading: VI. GCC Denial of Climate Impacts on Human Health, text: VI. GCC Denial of Climate Impacts on Human Health
A.  As early as 1994, the GCC questioned if modeling was able to “quantify the cost of climate change with respect to … health” in an “Issues and Options: Potential Global Climate Change” report. In a 1995 GCC bulletin, the Coalition countered Harvard School of Public Health’s Dr. Paul Epstein, who contended that more tropical weather from global warming would lead to an increase of tropical disease. Then, in a 1996 strategy memo to the GCC Board of Directors, the GCC flagged that, “[f]or the first time, the Administration is likely to play the health card – an unfounded argument that climate change will cause an increase in diseases and will otherwise affect the health of US citizens.”

B.  GCC’s STAC received internal briefings from Exxon in 1996 outlining a strategy to foster debate and question findings that linked human health impacts to climate change. The GCC followed Exxon’s advice, releasing its own statements marking computer modeling as insufficient to show a causal connection between adverse impacts on human health and climate change.

C.  In 1997, the GCC quietly funded an American Council on Science and Health (ACSH) report on human health and climate. The final ACSH report was never circulated among the STAC committee from the documents we have here. However, in 1997, ACSH did publish a report on the subject titled “Global Climate Change and Human Health” and despite sharing the same subject as the STAC grant, the report disclosed no funding or support from the GCC or any other corporate entities. The report held that sustained fossil fuel consumption was “fundamental to the well-being of the human population,” thus, ACSH argued, the use of these fuels should not be curtailed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The efforts were successful : the US Congress refused to ratify Kyoto and Exxon later lobbied the Bush administration to pull out of the protocol altogether. This left global efforts to rein in greenhouse gas emissions in tatters.

McCoy told an undercover Unearthed reporter that although he didn’t believe Exxon had buried its own science, the company had cast doubt on the scientific consensus: “Did we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes. Did we hide our science, absolutely not. Did we join some of these ‘shadow groups’ to work against some of the early efforts? Yes, that’s true. But there’s nothing illegal about that. You know, we were looking out for our investments, we were looking out for our shareholders.”

The reference to “shadow groups” is likely to relate to a powerful network of think tanks and pressure groups through which Exxon fought both the science and political action on climate change. Between 1998 and 2014, the company spent at least $30 million funding climate denial groups, such as the Heartland Institute, Competitive Enterprise Institute, and Heritage Foundation.

This network played a critical role in shifting the Republican Party from a position of support for action to cut emissions in the 1980s to its near-total opposition to tackling climate change from the mid-1990s to today.

Geoffrey Supran, a researcher at Harvard University who has written a number of scientific papers on Exxon’s efforts to mislead the public on climate change, told Unearthed : “I don’t believe the company has ever publicly acknowledged its role in climate denial… to have active employees of the company acknowledge its past behaviour is significant and certainly relevant to ongoing litigation and investigations against the company.”

Supran continued: “The company has thrown up the straw man argument that they never hid or ‘covered up’ the science, but that’s never actually been our point. The point is that they misled the public about climate change by contributing quietly to climate science but loudly to promoting doubt about it, so what this person said seems exactly consistent with that.”

a carbon tax.
The proposal sought to spread the cost of tackling climate change beyond the fossil fuel sector, taxing businesses in every sector of the economy for each tonne of carbon emitted – either by them directly or embedded in products they sell to consumers. The cost of this would then be passed on to the public.

In making the announcement, Tillerson sketched the outlines of a new ExxonMobil playbook on climate change – one that accepts the science but nevertheless seeks to delay rapid emissions cuts.

Instead of subsidising renewables, governments should prioritise research and development to discover a “breakthrough” technology. In the meantime, Exxon would remain “fundamentally an oil and gas company because we think that’s what society needs and will have to have for the next 50 years”, Tillerson said.

He added that other members of the oil industry that have recently announced their support for a carbon tax – such as the American Petroleum Institute (API), an influential lobby group – did so because “they’ve got nothing else, so it’s an easy talking point to say, look I’m for a carbon tax”.

As alluded to by McCoy, in the absence of major legislation limiting US emissions – such as the cap-and-trade system proposed during the Obama administration – Biden has moved to accelerate the transition to clean energy and transport through government spending.

Speaking in early May, McCoy said: “We’re playing defence, because President Biden is talking about this big infrastructure package and he’s going to pay for it by increasing corporate taxes. So it’s a delicate balance we’re asking for help with taxes over here [lobbying for subsidies for a carbon capture project] and we’re saying, don’t increase our taxes over here.”

He explained that if the plan stuck to “roads and bridges”, the budget could be reduced from $2 trillion to $800 billion, limiting the need for tax rises: “The international tax piece is for, for ExxonMobil is close to a billion dollars.”

This would mean “the negative stuff starts to come out, because there’s a germaneness right… that doesn’t make any sense for a highway bill. Why would you put in something on emissions reductions, on climate change to oil refineries in a highway bill?”

Joe Manchin, I talk to his office every week, he is the kingmaker on this because he’s a Democrat from West Virginia which is [a] very conservative state, so he is, and he’s not shy about sort of staking his claim early and completely changing the debate.”

With the vast majority of the clean energy and transport spending now stripped from the proposed bipartisan legislation, Biden has signalled that he will attempt to address climate change through a separate budget reconciliation bill, which can be passed with a simple majority vote.

An Exxon spokesman said: Our discussions on the current infrastructure bill are not accurately portrayed. Our lobbying efforts are related to a tax burden that could disadvantage U.S. businesses, and we have made that position known publicly. ExxonMobil stands by our position that increased taxes on American businesses make the U.S. less competitive.

Throughout the GCC’s existence, the industries with the most to lose in a carbon-constrained future were ringleaders in the GCC and central in informing their denial and delay strategy. From GCC’s founding until it was disbanded, coal-burning electric utilities, oil majors and refiners, and other fossil fuel producers like coal mining companies, were central to the GCC’s strategy and output. Coal interests, oil and gas corporations, and their respective trade associations represented fifty-seven percent of the GCC’s membership over seven years of data uncovered in our documents. As shown below, coal, oil, and gas interests also dominated the GCC’s Board, the highest level of membership available within the GCC.

Coal mining companies and coal-fired utilities were one of the most well-represented interest groups in STAC. Powerful utility industry EEI, for instance, had more than their former staffer Shlaes running the GCC but also placed
John Kinsman
amongst STAC’s members. Kinsman was responsible for keeping STAC
abreast of IPCC findings
and
scrutinizing its science
. He also was responsible for shaping the
internal draft climate change primer
with Lenny Bernstein, discussed below, that both acknowledged the reality of anthropogenic climate change and debunked “contrarian theories” that supported natural climate variability. The primer in this form was never published publicly.
Another coal interest group, the Western Fuels Association , became a board member of GCC and committee member to STAC at the same time they were launching their own denial campaign, “the Greening Earth Society.” The WFA’s Ned Leonard served on STAC. Leonard eventually went on to work with EEI and the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity . In addition to WFA, The Electric Power Research Institute, the National Coal Association and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, all trade associations of utilities and coal interests, contributed four representatives to STAC’s efforts.

Alongside trade associations, member corporations reliant on coal were active members of STAC as well. Illinois Power Company and Union Electric (both entities now a part of Ameren Corporation ) seemed to have the greatest individual control, occupying the Co-Chair position, plus two additional support staff serving on STAC.

Oil companies and their trade associations were heavily represented within STAC as well. Individual corporations Mobil, Exxon, Texaco (now a part of Chevron ), and ARCO contributed five staffers to STAC. Like coal and utilities, oil interests concentrated their STAC support through their principal trade association, API, which committed four staff members to STAC. One of API’s STAC members was Mitchell Baer, who API hired away from the American Meteorological Society after Baer published work expressing skepticism toward the “enhanced greenhouse effect” as climate change was often referred to in the 1980s and early 90s.

As consensus around climate change grew, so did rifts between GCC’s industry members. The nine corporations that departed GCC from 1996 to 2000 included two automakers, one chemical manufacturer, one utility, and five oil companies. BP started the exodus in 1996, stating that “the time to consider the policy dimensions of climate change is not when the link between greenhouse gases and climate change is conclusively proven, but when the possibility cannot be discounted and is taken seriously by the society of which we are part. We in BP have reached that point.”

The documents in our collection reflect the internal tension caused by BP’s departure – fear that the GCC was receiving too much negative publicity and an interest to distance themselves from anti-Kyoto Protocol sentiments. Documents show the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers’ (AIAM) in internal discussions about leaving the GCC, stating, “[t]he message of the GCC is there is no scientific basis for global warming … AIAM Government Relations, Technical, and Manufacturing Operations Committees are considering whether to join the International Climate Change Partnership rather than continuing with the GCC.” Based on a 1998 GCC membership document distributed at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) Fourth Conference of the Parties, it appears that AIAM did leave the GCC soon after their internal discussion.

Another GCC STAC member was Ford Motor Company . In Ford’s 2001 Climate Report , the section, “Changing Our Approach to a Changing Climate,” recounted the early 1990’s when, “[a]long with energy companies, automakers and others, we questioned the science of climate change.” This period, of course, was when Ford was affiliated with the Global Climate Coalition. Ford then highlighted the late 1990’s as the period when “we started listening,” citing scientific consensus as the reason for it to “shift significantly” its “stance on climate change.” And Ford did, leaving the GCC in 1999 . The GCC responded to Ford, remaining steadfast to its core mission, claiming that Ford’s departure was “driven by a campaign of misinformation by fringe environmental groups.”

After the 1992 Earth Summit, the GCC’s principal objective was to slow down the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). New GCC documents reveal how the coalition took advantage of their seat at the table during the UNFCCC process and sought to influence Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. The GCC infiltrated the process and informed industry allies about the latest scientific findings, the same information they used to craft the next volley of denial. A previously unknown “ IPCC Tracker budget ” garnered 30 percent of total committee expenditures , two-and-a-half times larger than the average GCC committee’s funds, during 1994, 1995, and 1996 (the only tax records we have acquired thus far).

The GCC used these funds to aggressively track and attack the IPCC, its peer review process , and its underlying models . While critical of its goals, the GCC remained keen on UNFCCC and IPCC developments , sending delegations of more than 20 people to the COP meetings, hiring independent contractors to listen in their stead, and distributing their staff and members to other business-friendly NGOs – forming one coordinated coalition bearing many different names.

For instance, at the Second Conference of Parties (COP-2) in 1996, the GCC sent twenty-eight delegates , representing ten member companies from the automotive, utility, manufacturing, petroleum, and mining industries. At the same COP, seventeen representatives of GCC member companies like Dow Chemical, BP, and Duke Power (now Duke Energy) participated in the COP wearing badge credentials of eight additional organizations. Further, none of the three GCC STAC members attending COP-2 disclosed their GCC affiliation, opting instead to wear badges of The Climate Council or the Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs D’Auotomobiles, for instance. That totals forty-five representatives with ties to GCC present at COP-2, more than two times the typical COP delegation from any one developing country (usually ranging from one to twenty members).

Additionally, the GCC and allies launched a sustained campaign against the IPCC Summary for Policymakers document that accompanies each IPCC report.

Simultaneously, demonstrated in previously unreleased documents, the GCC coordinated an aggressive attack on the IPCC process – erroneously targeting scientist Ben Santer through direct communications and public-facing editorials. The GCC widely distributed a memo to media outlets titled, “ The IPCC: Institutionalized ‘Scientific Cleansing .’” The memo argued that edits were made, “rais[ing] very serious questions about whether the IPCC has compromised, or even lost, its scientific integrity.”

Coal-funded GCC member Western Fuels Association also cited the memo in “ Bait and Switch?

STAC was at the center of shaping the GCC’s climate positions, emphasizing natural climate variabilities, questioning the reliability of climate modeling, and diminishing the importance of humanity’s role in greenhouse gas emissions. However, in a 1995 internal draft version of a GCC “ primer on climate change ”, written in response to the IPCC 2nd Assessment, Mobil Corporation’s staff scientist Lenny Bernstein (a STAC Co-Chair ) accepted anthropogenic climate change and debunked each of the prevailing “contrarian theories.” The “contrarian theories” section of the draft primer was subsequently removed by the Committee before publication. The draft memo that was approved by STAC , in contrast to Bernstein’s draft, concluded, “claims that human activities have already created a significant impact on climate, seem unsubstantiated given the many limitations and uncertainties in the studies used to support those claims.”

In addition to the sixty-three million dollars contributed to U.S. Congresspeople on behalf of GCC members from 1989 to 1999, documents revealed during litigation and through public record requests demonstrate the GCC targeted all aspects of U.S. government, with a special attention to the State Department when mitigatory action at the UNFCCC seemed to grow more imminent (the State Department led the U.S. Delegation to UNFCCC meetings). The GCC leveraged their relationships, effectively communicating talking points, position statements, key policy wishes, and STAC-composed reports and essays throughout that period.

They met with the Council on Environmental Quality , State Department , members of Congress , President Clinton and other Administration staff on at least ten occasions from 1996 to 1997. During that period, the State Department asked the GCC for input “on a number of issues … discussed at the next round of UN climate change meetings in July [1996].” The GCC STAC supplied a paper questioning the integrity of IPCC scientist Ben Santer, and the Second Assessment Report for not including enough discussion of “natural variability” or “natural forces.” The paper also criticized the use of the phrase, “discernible human influence” which was much stronger language than in the IPCC First Assessment Report. In at least two other meetings with the State Department, “[t]he GCC position was one of no need for rushing into any controls,” a message of delay that they aggressively repeated and defended in reports, monthly bulletins, and other materials aimed at influencing public opinion.

supplied a paper
questioning the integrity of IPCC scientist Ben Santer, and the Second Assessment Report for not including enough discussion of “natural variability” or “natural forces.” The paper also criticized the use of the phrase, “discernible human influence” which was much stronger language than in the IPCC First Assessment Report. In at least
two other meetings
with the State Department, “[t]he GCC position was one of no need for rushing into any controls,” a message of delay that they aggressively repeated and defended in reports, monthly bulletins, and other materials aimed at influencing public opinion.
The GCC continued to voice its opinion to government officials until at least 2001 , when a State Department briefing instructs Under Secretary Dobriansky to tell the GCC , that the “POTUS rejected Kyoto, in part, based on input from you.”

In 1996, the prospect of a mandatory treaty was looming and the GCC wanted to expand its reach, engaging more purposefully in the climate change dialogue on the ground in the U.S. In a newly published GCC Board of Directors memo, “ The Coalition’s Strategy in 1997 ,” outlined the GCC’s targeted plan and new State and Local Committee .

“GCC strategy must include broad based grassroots effort designed to present a balanced view on the climate issue an the state and local levels. The Coalition has formed a new State and Local Committee to monitor activities now occurring in individual states, to coordinate the state/local activities of all GCC committees, and to serve as a liaison with other business and public interest groups with similar views on climate change.”

GCC 1997 advertisement
One year later, in a 1997 Mother Jones article titled “ Astroturf Troopers ,” another internal memo was revealed showing the plan coming to fruition. In conjunction with an advertising campaign , the GCC’s Susan Moya penned a memo briefing its membership about a planned “Strike for Liberty” Kyoto Protocol protest, promising their “stateside” spokespeople daily updates from the negotiations, and attaching a list of media contacts and “In the States – Grassroots” allies.

Those contacts were comprised of several organizations from the now infamous Koch network, front groups and organizations created and funded by industry members of the GCC, and organizations from the pro-property rights, anti-regulatory “Wise Use” movement . The following list demonstrates those connections:

This document collection provides new insight into the GCC’s denial efforts surrounding the growing consensus that climate change impacts would have a negative effect on human health. As early as 1994 , the GCC questioned if modeling was able to “quantify the cost of climate change with respect to … health.” In 1995 , the GCC countered  Dr. Paul Epstein of the Harvard School of Public Health, who contended that more tropical weather from global warming would lead to more tropical disease. Then, in a 1996 strategy memo to the GCC Board of Directors (BoD), the GCC flagged that, “[f]or the first time, the Administration is likely to play the health card – an unfounded argument that climate change will cause an increase in diseases and will otherwise affect the health of US citizens.”

Soon after the BoD memo, Exxon’s Barry Friedlander and Dennis Devlin presented a white paper and follow-up slide deck to STAC on, “what’s known about the relationship between climate change and risks to human health, to address: diseases affected by temperature, including strengths, weaknesses and data gaps.” Devlin’s presentation recommended identifying “scientific leaders with ‘diverse’ views” and critiquing “predictive models” to foster debate. Emphasizing “key knowledge gaps,” the presentation eschewed evidence that changes in global temperature could negatively impact natural regulatory systems, or make epidemics, like malaria, more likely. The final bullet concluded with a recommendation: “Promote Concept of Relative Risk … Significance of Climate Impacts vs. Other Disease Factors.”

The final bullet concluded with a recommendation: “Promote Concept of Relative Risk … Significance of Climate Impacts vs. Other Disease Factors.”
These presentations inspired STAC to search for someone with, “appropriate credentials to be a spokesman for the issue … someone with a medical degree and some reputation,” they wrote. Seemingly unable to find a doctor, STAC eventually contacted two think tanks to generate opinions consistent with their members’. STAC Co-Chair Lenny Bernstein of Mobil recommended the GCC reach out to corporate-supported think tanks, the American Council of Science and Health (ACSH) and Institute for Evaluating Health Risks (IEHR), both of which were being funded by Mobil Foundation at the time. While members of the IEHR management committee overlapped with the GCC’s (i.e. Exxon and Dow Chemical), ACSH won the STAC contract to write a study countering the causal relationship between climate and human health.

The GCC eventually received editorial discretion over the final copy of the ACSH paper it funded, but the final product was never explicitly distributed in the documents we have available. However, in 1997, ACSH published “ Global climate change and human health ” which matched the subject and description of the STAC grant . However, the report disclosed no funding or support from the GCC or any other corporate entity or representative. The ACSH report stressed that any correlation between climate change and human health was “hypothetical,” estimated, or underdeveloped. The report also held that sustaining fossil fuel consumption would be better for human health than any reduction in fossil fuel consumption to combat theoretical climate change.

As Exxon scientist Devlin suggested, the GCC targeted climate science modeling, emphasized health problems unrelated to climate, and highlighted dissenting opinions that validated the GCC’s stance in that document. Two months after Devlin’s presentation, the GCC wrote in a position statement , “[c]oncerns that climate change might be the cause of various health problems rests on a number of unproved assumptions.” In conclusion, the document labeled other issues more-deserving of regulatory attention, “ climate change is a marginal factor in the broad range of public policy options that should be examined in addressing health concerns around the globe .” The GCC republished that position statement in 1997 .
