The Santo Antônio Hydroelectric Plant (UHE Santo Antônio) operates a large hydroelectric plant located in the Amazon region. Construction activities required the removal of vegetation along the banks of the Madeira River, for which subcontractors were hired. During the vegetation clearance, the Environmental Commission of the Rondônia State Legislative Assembly received complaints that the subcontractors were setting fires in areas of the Santo Antônio and Jirau Hydroelectric Plants. SEDAM issued an infraction notice, alleging that the subcontractors burned 2,280 hectares of vegetation (1,750 hectares belonging to Santo Antônio S.A.) and imposed a fine of R$10,000,000.00. In its claim, the plaintiff asserts that the fires in question were criminal and that it took all necessary preventive measures. It seeks recognition of the statute of limitations or, alternatively, the annulment of the administrative act on the grounds of defects and the absence of elements necessary to establish administrative liability. As an injunction, the company requests the suspension of the enforceability of the fine and an order for SEDAM to refrain from taking any action that would require payment of the fine.

The plaintiff argues that the emissions associated with the ANP's offers of blocks for oil and gas exploration could compromise compliance with the targets set by Brazil under the Paris Agreement, which have been internalized in the Brazilian legal system with supra-legal status. Also, it is argued that oil and gas exploration contradicts the national energy policy's objectives, which include protecting the environment and mitigating GHG emissions. The plaintiff states there is no transparency about the calculations or emission estimates associated with the ANP's offers of blocks for oil and gas exploration or mitigation plans. He, therefore, seeks to provide the information needed to assess these impacts and possibly avoid the need for subsequent legal action to correct the country's energy policies. Specifically, the aim is to clarify whether the federal government (i) estimates the GHG emissions potentially generated by the offer of oil and gas exploration blocks in ANP auctions at the time of or before the publicity of the offer notice; (ii) calculates how the emissions that will result from the oil and gas exploration of the blocks offered, if they are acquired, may affect compliance with the Brazilian NDC and the Paris Agreement; (iii) has some kind of calculation or analysis of how emissions from burning Brazilian oil exported to other countries affect the global climate system; (iv) has a plan for mitigating emissions from oil and gas exploration in the blocks offered by the ANP; and (v) takes these emissions into account when establishing the country's energy policy.",Access to information on the climate impact of emissions associated with the offers of blocks for oil and gas exploration,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231212_-Instituto-Arayara-vs.-ANP-e-Uniao-Federal-Producao-Antecipada-de-Provas-sobre-leiloes-de-oleo-e-gas_petition.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2024/20240718_-Instituto-Arayara-vs.-ANP-e-Uniao-Federal-Producao-Antecipada-de-Provas-sobre-leiloes-de-oleo-e-gas_reply.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2024/20240704_-Instituto-Arayara-vs.-ANP-e-Uniao-Federal-Producao-Antecipada-de-Provas-sobre-leiloes-de-oleo-e-gas_petition.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/arayara-institute-vs-anp-and-federal-union-anticipated-production-of-evidence-on-oil-and-gas-auctions

The plaintiff alleges that the exploitation of minerals in the state is being affected by extreme atmospheric phenomena, a situation neglected by the federative entity. It is pointed out that the negligence regarding the climate issue resulted in the flooding of the Downstream Containment Structure (ECJ) dam built by Vale S/A in the Municipality of São Sebastião das Águas Claras after heavy rains, flooding roads in the region, leaving the district without access to water, electricity, transportation, garbage removal and other essential services. The author indicates that the project was not preceded by an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) or due environmental licensing. The plaintiff emphasizes that the company is unable to measure the impacts of a possible dam failure if the ECJ reservoir is overflowing with water and tailings. It is affirmed that it is therefore necessary to review the hydraulic modeling for this type of project through a corrective environmental licensing process. Still regarding Vale S/A, it is required the stoppage of the Apolo Project, since the studies presented in the scope of its environmental licensing processes would not have analyzed the influence of the intensification of extreme climatic events on the operation of the activity. The environmental licensing process for the Serra do Taquaril Mining Complex, managed by Mineração Taquaril S/A, is also to be halted, considering that the effects of climate change on the project have not been assessed. According to the EIA, due to the Complex, sediment containment basins will be built, which, if they break, will directly impact a water intake pipeline, affecting the supply of 70% of the local population. The plaintiff argues that the National Policy on Climate Change and the State Policy for Preventing and Combating Disasters Resulting from Heavy Rainfall should guide environmental licensing in the State of Minas Gerais, in order to include the climate variable in the procedure, following a decision issued by the 9th Federal Court of Porto Alegre, which determined the inclusion of climate guidelines in the Terms of Thermoelectric Power Plants in Rio Grande do Sul State. It is required that the environmental licensing of the Serra do Taquaril Complex and the Apolo Project must be suspended and the corrective licensing of the JTC must be immediately initiated.
In its reply, Vale S/A informed that the Apolo Project was at a preliminary stage, still under analysis by the competent environmental agency, so as not to represent danger to the environment. It informed that ECJ would already be going through a corrective licensing phase before the competent environmental agency, which is why there was no interest in acting by the plaintiff. It defended the existence of an impossible passive joinder of defendants, since there would be no relationship between the defendants or affinity between the requests made against each defendant. Subsequently, the plaintiff requested an amendment to the initial application, in order to exclude Vale S/A from the defendant's position. In August 2022, a partial judgment was rendered that extinguished the claim against Vale S/A. Afterwards, the court dismissed the action, without resolution of the merits, for inadequacy of the chosen path.

"Greenpeace Ltd v (1) Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and (2) the Oil and Gas Authority; and Uplift v (1) SSBEIS and (2) the OGA (North Sea oil and gas licensing)",2022,,pending,"Suits against governments, Environmental assessment and permitting, Natural resource extraction, Suits against governments, Energy and power","United Kingdom, England and Wales, High Court of Justice","United Kingdom, Environmental Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 2004, United Kingdom, Petroleum Act 1998","These challenges concern the legality of the following decisions, all of which relate to the licensing of North Sea oil.
•	On Sep. 7, 2022, the UK government adopted its non-statutory Offshore Energy Plan (“the Plan”). This Plan was the subject of a strategic environmental assessment (“SEA”), known as “OESEA4”.
•	On Sep. 8, 2022, the government approved the design of its “Climate Compatibility Checkpoint” (“the Checkpoint”). The stated aim of this policy was to ensure that, before a new North Sea oil and gas licensing round is offered, “the compatibility of future licensing with the UK’s climate objectives is evaluated”. In approving the design of this policy, a proposed test was omitted. That test would have considered whether end-use emissions from the combustion of UK oil are expected to fall in line with the 1.5°C temperature target, if further licensing rounds are approved.
•	On Sep.16, 2022, the government decided that a further licensing round was compatible with the UK’s climate objectives. That was informed by departmental analysis by reference to the Checkpoint.
•	On Oct. 4, 2022, the Oil and Gas Authority (“OGA”) invited applications for offshore oil and gas licenses under section 3 of the Petroleum Act 1998, in what is known as the 33rd Offshore Oil and Gas Licensing Round. The OGA is a company wholly owned by the UK government which, since March 2022, has traded under the name “The North Sea Transition Authority”.
These decisions were challenged in public law claims issued in December 2022 by environmental charities Greenpeace and Uplift. In April 2023 both claims were granted permission to proceed to trial. In July 2023 they were heard. In October 2023 the High Court dismissed both claims, rejecting all the grounds of challenge:
•	The decision in OESEA4 not to assess end-use emissions from further oil and gas licensing rounds was rational. There was no breach of the relevant SEA regulations. Whilst the leading case of R(Finch) v Surrey County Council [2022] EWCA Civ 187 concerned environmental impact assessment, not SEA, the factual context and the two regimes were sufficiently analogous that important parts of the Finch analysis were applicable. Here the Plan only set the framework for licensing oil and gas exploration and production in the North Sea. It did not set the framework for downstream development such as refinement and storage. The end-use emissions from uses of the extracted oil and gas were not therefore “likely significant effects” of the Plan under the SEA regulations. Further, it was lawful for the government to conclude there was an insufficient causal connection between new oil and gas licensing and end-use emissions, and to decline to assess such emissions on that basis also. (Judgment, paragraphs 89 to 116.)
•	The government did not fail to properly to assess “reasonable alternatives” under the SEA regulations. That failure was said by the claimants to have resulted from a failure to properly assess the alternative of not proceeding with further licensing. However, to the extent this entailed arguments about market substitution, these did not arise given end-use emissions were not assessed. As to assessments of production emissions, these were matters of judgement. Nor was it unlawful for the government to have concluded that imports would have a higher emissions intensity than UK-produced hydrocarbons. (Judgment, paragraphs 117 to 136.)
•	The reasons for omitting the end-use emissions test from the Checkpoint were lawful and rational. It was also rational for the government to rely on the Checkpoint when adopting the Plan and deciding the new licensing round was compatible with the UK’s climate objectives. The Checkpoint is not a statutory plan or policy. It is an informative, non-binding document to assist ministers in deciding whether to support or not support a further licensing round. It was a matter of judgement for the Secretary of State as to whether he considered there to be an appropriate test or benchmark for taking scope 3 emissions into account on a decision whether or not to support a new licensing round. (Judgment, paragraphs 137 to 150.)
•	The failure to publish reasons for deciding a new licensing round would be compatible with the Checkpoint and the UK’s climate objectives was not unlawful. There was no common law duty to give reasons. (Judgment, paragraphs 151 to 158.)
•	Further grounds of challenge related to the OGA’s decision to carry out the 33rd licensing round necessarily failed, given the findings above (judgment, paragraphs 58 and 159).

It is argued that in the period from 2009 to 2023, the Federal Government, and from 2010 to 2023, the state of Rio Grande do Sul, by action or omission, failed to comply with the legal guidelines and did not meet the deadlines and targets set out in the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC), the Paris Agreement and the Rio Grande do Sul ‘s Policy on Climate Change (PGMC), as there was no effective implementation of instruments such as the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), equal and transparent composition of the Rio Grande do Sul Climate Change Forum (FGMC) and the Brazilian Climate Change Forum and no measures have been taken to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from coal-fired power plants in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with a Just Energy Transition (TEJ) plan, which results in the ineffectiveness of these climate standards. It is pointed out that the climate crisis has led to water shortages in the municipality of Candiota, which has been recognized by municipal decree and that, in parallel to this situation, the various coal-fired thermoelectric plants in the region use local water for cooling, causing damage to the water system, the biome and the climate. It is alleged that the defendants have neglected climate policy when dealing with the licensing and renewal of licenses for these projects in the state. At the same time, the Federal Government has encouraged coal-fired thermoelectric projects through energy auctions authorized by ANEEL. CRM, responsible for the Candiota coal mine, and CGT Eletrosul, responsible for the Candiota III Thermoelectric Plant - the most polluting and least efficient plant in the country - have been operating in disregard of environmental climate laws. It is argued that it is up to the Judiciary, based on the principle of the prohibition of regression and duties of protection, to guarantee effective compliance with the rules in question and prevent the climate scenario from worsening. It is argued that the entire situation of alleged unlawfulness gives rise to a claim for compensation for collective moral damages. The plaintiffs make several requests for injunctive relief for the various defendants, so that the defendants' conduct is brought into line with the environmental climate standards. On the merits, it is requested that (i) the requests for preliminary injunctions be confirmed; (ii) it be declared that in the period from 2009 to 2023, the Federal Government, and from 2010 to 2023, the state of Rio Grande do Sul, by action or omission, failed to comply with climate standards and did not meet the deadlines and targets set out in the PNMC, the Paris Agreement and the PGMC, because they did not give effect to the regulations and did not act to reduce GHG emissions from coal-fired thermoelectric plants in the state; (iii) to declare that Rio Grande do Sul has failed to meet the targets and deadlines set out in international, national and state regulations; (iv) the suspension of public incentives to exploit coal in the state, the implementation of a TEJ plan for the contested plants; the publication of public notices to finance educational projects and research projects with universities and federal institutes that encourage environmental awareness and the guidelines of the PNMC and PGM; the creation of a WG for the decommissioning and energy transition of coal-fired projects; the suspension and non-renewal of energy sales contracts for the contested plants; (v) ordering the defendants to pay compensation for climate damage; (vi) ordering the Federal Government and the state of Rio Grande do Sul to bear the costs of the requests made; (vii) ordering all the defendants to pay the sum of ten million reais as collective moral damage in environmental and climate matters.","The lawsuit seeks to order the defendants to adopt effective measures to comply with the guidelines, deadlines and targets set out in federal and state (Rio Grande do Sul) climate laws.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230706_Public-Civil-Action-ACP-5050920-75.2023.4.04.7100_petition-1.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/instituto-preservar-agapan-and-nucleo-amigos-da-terra-vs-federal-union-and-others-climate-emergency-in-rio-grande-do-sul-state

Section 167C states that before setting clean car standards, the Minister of Transport must “be satisfied … that the targets are set at an appropriate level to increase the supply of zero- and low-emissions vehicles in the market.” Standards must also be “consistent with transport-specific policies and strategies outlined in the emissions reduction plan.” The Better New Zealand Trust argues that the new targets will “decrease compared to the previous targets, and that the Emissions Reduction Plan target to have 30% of the fleet as EVs by 2035 will be that much harder to achieve.”","Whether changes to New Zealand’s Clean Car Standard – which relax car import efficiency requirements – meet the statutory requirement that they increase the supply of zero- and low-emission vehicles in the market, and that they are consistent with New Zealand’s emissions reduction plan.",No case documents are available.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/better-new-zealand-trust-v-minister-for-transport

The plaintiffs seek the suspension and subsequent annulment of the environmental licensing process of the Portocem Thermoelectric Plant (UTE), powered by natural gas, which is to be installed in the Pecém Industrial and Port Complex (CIPP). They claim there is non-compliance with legal norms and several omissions in the Environmental Impact Study (EIA), including (i) the concealment of indigenous communities in the vicinity of the project, (ii) the disregard of impacts related to water resources, (iii) the disregard of potential socioeconomic impacts, (iv) the underestimation of damage to health, and (v) the disregard of climate impacts. They also believe that there was no adequate analysis of synergistic and cumulative impacts with other enterprises in the region, considering their insertion in an Industrial Complex. In relation to climate impacts, the plaintiffs argue that the EIA failed to list important consequences for climate stability. They mention the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and how the use of fossil fuels is incompatible with the guiding principles of the national energy policy. They argue that Brazil and the state of Ceará have made a legal commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which goes against the implementation of a new gas-fired thermoelectric plant. The plaintiffs also point out that the Northeast is one of the regions in Brazil most vulnerable to climate change and stress the importance of the risk analysis of the project to the water security of the region, considering that the water resources of the Northeast are under pressure from climate change. On top of the problems in the impact assessment, the plaintiffs also state flaws in the licensing process due to the lack of effective public participation.

The plaintiffs asked the court to suspend and cancel the environmental permitting process for the Guaíba Mine Project, led by Copelmi, considered the largest open-pit coal project in the country. The project is to be installed in areas inhabited by traditional communities, such as the Z-5 Fishermen's Colony and indigenous territories. It relates to the State Coal Policy and the Carbochemical Pole of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) - created by State Law 15.047/2017—which the plaintiffs claim was instituted without popular consultation. They argue that more public hearings for the project were requested by affected communities, but the requests were ignored. In addition, they point out that there was no prior, free and informed consultation with the fishermen of Colony Z-5, a traditional community. They claim that the Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA/RIMA) for the project has many gaps, since it ignored the area of influence of the Atlantic Forest biome and the rights of the affected communities. They argue the permitting process violated the Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO), the Federal
Constitution and the State Environmental Code of Rio Grande do Sul, and must be declared null as it also contradicts the fight against climate change determined by the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187 / 2009).",Whether the permitting of open-pit coal project has been conducted in violation of the National Policy on Climate Change and without proper participation and prior consultation to traditional fishermen communities.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2019/20190927_ACP-n-5044993-20.2019.8.21.0001-5125450-05.2020.8.21.0001_petition.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200211_ACP-n-5044993-20.2019.8.21.0001-5125450-05.2020.8.21.0001_petition.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200311_ACP-n-5044993-20.2019.8.21.0001-5125450-05.2020.8.21.0001_petition.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/instituto-internacional-arayara-and-fishermens-colony-z-5-v-copelmi-mineracao-ltda-and-fepam-mina-guaiba-project-and-affected-communities

The Auction results from the Federal Law 14.182/2022, which determined the privatization of Brazilian Energy Company Eletrobras, but whose legislative process included the insertion of unrelated content, determining the contracting of energy from gas-fired thermoelectric plants. The plaintiff alleges that the climate crisis is incompatible with the increase in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) that will be generated by the thermoelectric plants, which could lead to a 39% increase in annual GHG emissions for the electricity sector compared to the levels registered in 2021. It points to several negative impacts associated with the projects of gas-fired thermoelectric plants to be installed in areas of the Legal Amazon. They will generate socio-environmental impacts on traditional communities, native peoples, and protected areas; compromise the use of local water resources, due to the high water-use; and increase the price of electricity for consumers. This would worsen climate change and violate the National Environmental Policy Act (Federal Law 6.938/1981), the National Climate Change Policy (Federal Law 12.187/2009), the Paris Agreement, and compromise the achievement of the Brazilian NDC. It is requested, as a preliminary injunction: (i) the suspension of ANEEL Auction or the suspension of its effects; (ii) in the event the Auction is maintained, it is requested that the defendants submit an inventory of GHG emissions from all the thermoelectric plants involved, as well as the impact of the emissions on compliance with the Brazilian NDC. In final, it is requested: (i) the cancellation of Auction nº 008/2022, with the annulment of all its effects and the determination that no new similar auction be held on the basis of Federal Law 14,182/2022; (ii) in the event the Auction is maintained, that the defendants be required, definitively, to submit an inventory of GHG emissions of all the thermoelectric plants involved, as well as the impact of the emissions on compliance with the Brazilian NDC.",Challenge of National Agency of Electrical Energy (ANEEL) Auction which aims to hire energy from gas-fired thermoelectric plants.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220927_ACP-n-1063902-55.2022.4.01.3400_petition.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/instituto-internacional-arayara-vs-national-electrical-energy-agency-and-brazil

The aim of the action is to deregulate the carbon market established by this policy. The party alleges a formal defect in the legislative process, claiming that the legislative process was diverted to serve private interests at the expense of environmental protection. On substantive grounds, it is argued that the law infringes constitutional provisions related to an ecologically balanced environment, the social function of property, the prohibition of insufficient protection, and free enterprise. The party contends that the law’s actual purpose is to provide financial support to the biofuels sector rather than to protect the environment. This assertion is based on RenovaBio’s alleged failure to contribute effectively to GHG emission reductions due to the lack of additionality in Decarbonization Credits (CBIOs), meaning no measurable and effective reduction in GHG emissions or CO₂ removal occurs, as required by the law, to genuinely mitigate climate change.",Whether articles of the National Biofuels Policy Act - Renovabio are unconstitutional.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2024/20240402_84436_petition.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/adi-7617-renovabio

The action challenges Law 14.182/2021, which deals with the privatization of the national electricity company Eletrobras and promotes changes in the Brazilian electricity sector regime. The law derived from a provisional measure, which can only be adopted in exceptional circumstances. The plaintiffs argue that the provisional measure, which was then turned into the law in question, lacked the requirement of urgency, circumventing the regular legislative process. They claim that, when considering the conversion of the provisional measure, the National Congress approved amendments that resulted in substantial changes to Brazilian energy planning. The final wording of the provisions reveals an undue attempt to prevent a possible veto by the President of the Republic. The Law, under the terms approved, requires the mandatory contracting of energy from small hydroelectric power plants and natural gas thermoelectric plants. The plaintiffs argue that such a requirement makes the necessary decarbonization of the Brazilian energy matrix more distant and will lead to an increase in annual greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), in breach of the commitments made under the Paris Agreement and by the President of the Republic at COP26. The plaintiffs point out that the enactment of the Law violates the legal and constitutional order since it is contrary to the duty to act in favor of the protection of intact and stable climatic conditions.
