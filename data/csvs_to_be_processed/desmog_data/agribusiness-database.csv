A 2009 Teagascstudyquantified how beef and dairy cattle numbers would need to be reduced for the sector to align with the EU’s goal for a 20 percent reduction in total sector emissions by 2020 relative to 2005.37Donnellan, T., Gillespie, P., Hanrahan, K. “Impact Of Greenhouse Gas Abatement Targets On Agricultural Activity,” 2009.Archived April 2, 2024.Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
Relatedly, Teagasc economist Trevor Donnellanpointed outin 2009 that Irish agricultural greenhouse gas emissions had been decreasing, that they could continue to fall over the next decade, and that on this trajectory a reduction of 10 percent relative to 2005 levels would be possible.38“Teagasc finds fall in agriculture emissions but challenges remain,”Irish Examiner, March, 17, 2009.Archived April 2, 2024.

Instead, the sector’s emissions have risen substantially since 2010. Teagasc has concentrated on encouraging farmers to adopt technical measures that reduce the “carbon footprint” of milk and meat production, including policies that support the “intensification of animal agriculture”.TheSignpost39“Signpost Programme,” Teagasc, 2024.Archived July 31, 2024Archive URL:https://archive.ph/7Fb9KandAgNav40“AgNav,” Teagasc.Archived January 10, 2024.

‘Marginal Abatement Cost Curves’ (MACC)Since 2012, Teagasc’s technical analyses use a ‘Marginal Abatement Cost Curve’ (MACC) approach, a tool that ways up costs or savings expected from different emission reduction pathways.Teagasc’s MACC analysis does not consider policy to limit total system nutrient inputs or total animal-type numbers’ directly through regulation or taxation.Aresearch reportin 2020 noted that MACC analysis methods have been “strongly critiqued” in academic literature, but that “these flaws are often overlooked in policy use of MACC curves”.41McMullin B. and Price, P.

MACC reports primarily recommend technical measures for voluntary adoption by farmers to improve the “carbon footprint” (emissions intensity in emissions per kg of output) of their milk and livestock production.
Aideen O’Dochartaigh, assistant professor in accounting at Dublin City University,toldIrish investigative website Noteworthy in 2021 that focusing on emissions intensity (efficiency) measurements was “a red herring”. She was reported saying “it has been a “massive problem” for years that companies are “increasing their activity while increasing their efficiency and it all cancels out”.42Niall Sargent, “Transparency gap: State bodies holding back company emissions data from the public,”Noteworthy, May 3, 2021.Archived February 6, 2023.

Irish environmental charity An Taisce, the National Trust for Ireland, stronglycriticisedTeagasc’s 2023 MACC report as failing to “appropriately acknowledge the escalation of agriculture emissions almost every year since the first MACC was published in 2012, despite all MACCs being considered the ‘roadmap’ for agricultural action on climate and cutting emissions”.43“Teagasc MACC Not Fit For Purpose,” An Taisce, July 17, 2023.Archived February 7, 2024.

Since 2010, Teagasc hasissuedthree climate mitigation reports – in 2012, 2018, and the latest in 2023 – that have adopted the approach of the so-called “Marginal Abatement Cost Curve” (MACC), a tool that aims to rank the relative cost effectiveness of different measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture and land use sectors.24“Marginal Abatement Cost Curve 2023,” Teagasc report, July 12, 2023.Archived February 7, 2024.

These mitigation assessments have been key to enabling the expansion of animal agriculture achieved by Ireland’s decadal policy plans, by insisting that technical efficiency measures and their voluntary adoption by farmers would enable sector-wide absolute emission reductions, despite the growth of the sector.

For example, in an April 2021 written statement, Teagasctoldthe parliamentary agriculture committee that: “Given the low carbon footprint of Irish milk and meat, Ireland can continue to strive to meet growing international market demand for food so as to contribute to global food security and avoid carbon leakage [production shifting to other countries with laxer emission constraints] whilst at the same time meeting environmental obligations including those related to climate change.”46“The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill implications for agriculture – Teagasc statement to the Oireachtas Agriculture Committee,” Teagasc, April 14, 2021.Archived September 25, 2021. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
A 2024research papernotes that “contrary to the vague assertions commonly made in industry and advisory documents, if anything, carbon leakage has thus likely been more toward Ireland (as agriculture has consistently ignored agreed emissions goals), not away from Ireland to other nations.”47Price, P. R. “Agricultural Methane in Irish Climate Action: greenhouse gas metrics, methane mitigation, and related quantification of livestock numbers,” Legacy4LIFE Programme, Task 2.2 Report. May 2024.Archived June 18, 2024.Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
The same paper concluded that these talking points – such as efficiency claims, carbon leakage, or “feeding the world” – that had featured heavily in agricultural advice over the past decade lacked “quantitative or regulatory substance” and served to “distract from the primary requirement for advice that will help enable a dependable transition pathway for Ireland’s agri-food system within the agreed commitments to meet absolute emission reduction targets and pollution ceilings.”","May 2024

According to the article, “Neither the Declaration nor the Dublin Summit received financial backing from the industry, nor was their content influenced”. The authors noted that Teagasc provided “the sole financial support, a modest sum of 40,000 Euros to facilitate organization of the Summit.”62Frédéric Leroy et al., “Opinion piece: Activist tactics and the discrediting of scientists.

In the Oireachtas (Parliament), Neasa Hourigan TDraised a number of concernsaround Teagasc’s role in supporting the declaration’s launch, citing the minister of state’s attendance at the summit, and possible biases of the declaration’s lead authorship.63“Saincheisteanna Tráthúla – Topical Issue Debate – Dáil Éireann (33rd Dáil).” Houses of the Oireachtas, November 9, 2023.Archived April 4, 2024.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/6RSEjHourigan specifically noted that lead authorPeer Edererhad commented, “What started the [Dublin Declaration] coverage in Ireland is not the brilliance of our science but the fact that we had a minister and a commissioner there”, referencing thefindingsof Unearthed.
Hourigan stated, “Most lobbyists pay the State for access and consideration but Ireland must be in a unique position of paying those same lobbyists €39,000 for the privilege of being manipulated and hoodwinked by an unethical and anti-science industry operative. Teagasc was founded as a research and industry development body. If we cannot rely on the data and scientific objectivity of Teagasc, where does that leave us?”
Responding on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, deputy Sean Fleming said that, while Teagasc had hosted the Summit and agreed to pay some of the cost of it, it “did not host the Dublin Declaration”.
Fleming stated, “The declaration emerged subsequent to the summit; it was not overseen by Teagasc at the event […] Teagasc has assured me that as a State agency it has no conflict of interest when it comes to these matters”.
However, a Teagascpress releaseappears to contradict Fleming’s claim. The document, which was issued on the first day of the conference, and features a photograph of Fleming with the Teasgasc leadership, links directly to the Dublin Declaration website and states that “Summit attendees, with academic and scientific credentials, will be invited to endorse the evidence base by signing the ‘Dublin Declaration of Scientists on the Societal Role of Meat’”.64“Leading scientists advance science in global meat debate,” Teagasc, October 19, 2022.Archived January 12, 2024.

At a webinar event on December 9, researcherspresentedTeagasc Sectoral Roadmaps 2027,  providing its outlook for the next seven years by agricultural sub-sector: dairy, beef, sheep, pigs, tillage (arable crops), forestry, horticulture and environment.70“Teagasc Sectoral Roadmaps 2027,” Teagasc. December 9, 2020.Archived December 9, 2020.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/ABqTN
While Teagasc’s overview report acknowledged the “significant challenge” posed by emissions reductions, its2027 Sectoral Road Map: Dairyprojected an increase in dairy cow numbers from 1,465,000 in 2019 to 1,650,000 in 2027, with a rise in milk output from 7.99 billion litres to 9.49 billion litres.
The environment roadmap did not acknowledge that total emissions from the agriculture sector had alreadyrisensubstantially since 2011 (largely due increases in fertiliser use and dairy farming), and did not align with the EU 2020 target of reducing national emissions including agriculture by 20 percent.71Josh Gabbatiss. “In-depth Q&A: Why Ireland is ‘nowhere near’ meeting its climate-change goals.” Carbon Brief. June 18, 2019.Archived June 18, 2019.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/edSer
However, the Teagasc roadmap did note that, “In recent years water quality has disimproved”, contrary to the ultimate objective (under the EU Water Framework Directive), of “Achieving good or excellent status in 100% of ground and surface water.” As for emissions mitigation, the sectoral roadmaps primarily proposed efficiency measures to improve water quality and reduce ammonia emissions.

Teagasc has itself been accused of lobbying on behalf of the dairy industry by the NGO An Taisce, after commentsmadeby Teagasc’s then-director Dr. Gerry Boyle at an agricultural college graduation ceremony, in which he stated:“We don’t want quotas coming in by the back door, particularly in dairy, and that is the risk. You only have to go to the North of Ireland to see what a restriction in relation to ammonia has done (in putting) the brakes on developing a dairy industry.

Ibec was one of the groups, along with theIrish Farmers Associationand theIrish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, which successfully lobbied to have the Irish government drop the 2010 Climate Change Response bill.

FOEI directly criticised Ibec for maintaining that the 2020 target in the bill was “more demanding than Ireland’s EU target”, which FOEI said was incorrect. Ananalysisin January 2011 by Oisin Coghlan of FOEI described Ibec’s position on the bill as “at least presumptive, if not also a little disingenuous”.62Oisin Coghlan.“Irish Emissions Reductions Targets: EU & climate Bill,” Friends of the Earth Ireland, January 11, 2010.Archived September 29, 2023.

Meat Industry Ireland (MII) is the Ibec-affiliated trade association for meat processors.
MII states that its members “fully accept the challenge of climate change and the need for increased action to minimise the impact of meat production on natural resources, to reduce GHG emissions and to protect our natural environment for future generations”.33“Climate Change MII presentation to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine,” February 20, 2018.Archived June 20, 2024.

In 2022 beef cattleemittedaround half of Ireland’s agricultural methane according to inventory data from Ireland’s EPA.
Meat Industry Ireland “accepted that agriculture does account for a sizable portion of Ireland’s overall emissions” in a 2019statementto the parliamentary Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine (agriculture sector emissionsmade up38 percent of the national total in 2023).34“Ireland’s Provisional Greenhouse Gas Emissions 1990-2023 [web page],” EPA. July 2024.Archived July 9, 2024.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/kf3rBHowever, the group also contended that “it would be counter-productive to curtail beef production in regions of the world, such as Ireland, that are eco-efficient producers, to instead allow for expansion in less environmentally efficient areas”.35“The Future of the Beef Sector in Ireland MII Submission to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food & the Marine,” Meat Industry Ireland, March 25, 2019.Archived July 24, 2024.Archive URL:https://archive.is/wJuG1The sameclaimswere made in 2015 by former Meat Industry Ireland director Cormac Healy, in The Irish Examiner. He wrote that it would be “foolhardy” for Ireland to reduce its beef output, as it would lead to carbon leakage, ie. production shifting to other countries with more lax emission constraints.36Joe Dermody. “Meat sector says Ireland is top performer on climate change,”Irish Examiner, December 7, 2015.Archived February 22, 2024. Archive URL:https://archive.is/PbBrL
A 2024research papersaid “vague assertions” around efficiency commonly used by industry lacked “quantitative or regulatory substance”. It added: “…if anything, carbon leakage has likely been moretowardIreland (as agriculture has consistently ignored agreed emissions goals), not away from Ireland to other nations.”37Price, P.

A 2021fact sheetfrom MII, titled “Sustainable Irish Beef”, included the claim that Ireland’s low carbon footprint “makes it one of the top five most carbon efficient beef producers in the EU”.
The claim is based on a 2010 EU Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC)report,38A.

A 2011 peer-reviewedstudyfound Ireland’s beef carbon footprint to be substantially higher than the EU average,40Lesschen, J.P et al. “Greenhouse gas emission profiles of European livestock sectors.

Opposition to reduction in herd sizes
Meat Industry Ireland members opposed the inclusion of two measures to reduce beef suckler cow numbers, which were included in the August 2021releaseof the government’s Food Vision 2030 strategy for the agri-food sector.41“Launch of ‘Food Vision 2030 – A World Leader in Sustainable Food Systems’,” Merrion Street, August 4, 2021. Archived October 22, 2021. Archive URL:https://archive.is/ts0HL
A Beef and Sheep stakeholder group, which was consulted by the Minister of Agriculture on the strategy, published aresponsein November 2022 which stated that MII members opposed reductions on the grounds that “their inclusion will significantly undermine the industry” and “would lead to an annual loss of output and revenue with a resultant impact on the rural economy”.42“Final Report on the Food Vision Beef & Sheep Group to Mitigate GHG emissions from the Beef Sector,” Government of Ireland, November 30, 2022.Archived March 15, 2023. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
Meat Industry Ireland suggested that government proposals to spend money on reducing the suckler herd would be better spent on technical measures to reduce emissions, as well as funding farmers to incentivise uptake of the measures.
However, since 2010 such suckler herd measures have been advocated byTeagascand supported by government, yet methane emissions and nitrogen-excretion from beef cattle have remained approximately stable, according to data from the EPA, suggesting minimal effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ibec has expressed its support for climate action. In a 2024 campaign titled “Stronger Europe, Stronger Ireland”, Ibec said Irish business was “committed to the European Green Deal’s central tenet for Europe to become the first climate-neutral continent in 2050” and expressed its support for a 55 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.18“Stronger Europe Stronger Ireland,” Ibec, May 2024.Archived June 12, 2024.Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
However, in the same campaign Ibec also stressed that “if these targets are to be retained, Member States and obligated parties [companies] will need to retain existing flexibilities to deliver these in a cost-effective way”.
In 2023, Ibec launched a resource titled “Climate Action: A toolkit for business”, in which itstatedthat it would provide businesses with “the information they need for their climate action journey” and “practical guidance on how to develop an enduring climate action strategy”.19“Ibec Annual Report 2022-2023,” Ibec, October 5, 2023.Archived June 23, 2024. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
The toolkit stated that climate action is a “business imperative”. It noted that the only solution to climate change is a “dramatic reduction in GHG emissions”, along with the difficulty of reducing methane emissions from cattle digestion. The document also encouraged companies to commit to plans for absolute reductions to emissions, or to “emissions intensity” (ie. producing fewer emissions per kilo or milk or meat)
However, the Ibec resource fell short of the stipulations of Ireland’s 2021Climate Action Plan(CAP21). The toolkit suggested “alignment with national sectoral ceilings and Paris Agreement goals” was an “additional consideration”, but CAP21 requires national climate action to be “consistent with” meeting both the Paris Agreement goal to keep warming within 1.5C, andsectoral emission ceilings, a term for the maximum tonnes of CO2 equivalent gases (CO2e) that can be emitted over a five year period by agriculture and different sectors of the economy, as laid out by the Irish government’s legally binding carbon budgets.20“Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (amendment) Act 2021 (as Approved),” Government of Ireland, 2021.Archived January 22, 2022.Archive URL:https://archive.is/ScDtZ

It’s Complicated,”DeSmog, February 7, 2024.
The IFA voiced its support for the protests,notingin a February 1 press release that “Irish Farmers are showing solidarity with farmers across Europe this evening”. Francie Gorman was quoted saying: “There is mounting frustration about the impact of EU policy on European farmers, and its implementation here in Ireland.

Food Vision stakeholder group reports
In response to EPA reporting showing increasing negative climate and pollution impacts from livestock farming, the Minister of Agriculture, Charlie McConalogue,establishedseparate “Food Vision” stakeholder groups – for dairy, livestock, and arable (known as “tillage” in Ireland) – to consider how best to reduce the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient pollution.57Joe Mag Raollaigh. “A year in agriculture that couldn’t have been predicted,”RTÉ, December 28, 2022.Archived January 5, 2023.Archive URL:https://archive.is/uoWHW

The IFA lobbied to weaken targets contained in the July 2021 amended Climate Act, whichstipulatedthat Ireland’s parliament (the Oireachtas) must set legally binding five-year carbon budgets to direct climate action, and noted that the Government would then set out constituent “sectoral emission ceilings” for different economic sectors, including agriculture.60“Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (amendment) Act 2021 (as Approved),” Government of Ireland, June, 2021.Archived January 22, 2022.Archive URL:https://archive.is/ScDtZ

The Government’s Climate Action Plan had initiallysuggesteda range for agriculture emission reductions of 22 – 30 percent by 2030, in response to the amended Climate Act in November 2021.62Rachel Martin. “Government sets out plans for 22-30% reduction in farming emissions,”Irish Examiner, February 20, 2021.Archived November 4, 2021.Archive URL:https://archive.is/UnQTy
In July 2022, the IFAdemandedthat the Minister of Agriculture “must push back on any attempt to introduce a sectoral emission ceiling above 22%”. The group criticised a 30 percent reduction goal, saying it “would result in significantly reduced production” and “an increase in global emissions, as production will move to other countries with weaker climate policies”.63Aisling O’Brien. “Claim 30% emissions target could “devastate” agriculture sector,”Agriland.ie.

Then-IFA President Tim Cullinanarguedthat farmers were being asked to bear a disproportionate burden of climate action, in a July 11 op-ed for The Irish Times. He also claimed “Emissions from biogenic sources such as cattle are part of the biological recycling of carbon and do not contribute to increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere,”
Researchers at Dublin City University critiqued Cullinan’s arguments as “misleading”, in The Irish Times. Theystatedthat Cullinan had used “flawed premises” to support the notion that farmers were being unfairly treated.64Paul Price and Barry McMullin. “Climate crisis and agriculture: Opinions need to rest on facts,”The Irish Times, July 15, 2022.Archived July 15, 2022.Archive URL:https://archive.is/0wqML
The researchers also critique Cullinan’s “recommended ‘alternative method of measuring the global warming potential’” of methane, acontroversial metriccalled GWP*, which can be used to downplay the impact of livestock emissions.When on July 28, the Government landed on the lower target of a 25 percent reduction by 2030 (relative to 2018 emissions) for agriculture within the agreed legally binding five-year carbon budgets for 2021–2025 and 2026–2030, Cullinan stillarguedthat the target was “a potentially devastating blow for Irish farming and the rural economy” on the IFA website,65“Agriculture Sectoral Emissions Ceiling is a Potentially Devastating Blow for Irish Farming,” Irish Farmers’ Association, July 28, 2022.Archived July 28, 2022.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/JI61Qanddeniedthat farmers were “getting off lightly” in comparison to other sectors.66Vivienne Clarke. “IFA denies farmers ‘getting off lightly’ in emissions deal,”BreakingNews.ie.Archived July 29, 2022.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/loZlv
By contrast, Marie Donnelly, chair of Ireland’s Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC)describedthe Government’s Sectoral Emission Ceilings decision as “problematic”.
According to Donelly’s statement the emissions ceilings also did not meet the requirements of the amended Climate Act, being insufficient to meet the carbon budgets to 2030 agreed by the Oireachtas, and excluding five-year emissions ceilings for the Land Use Sector.67Marie Donnelly. “CCAC Chair’s statement on sectoral emission targets,” Climate Change Advisory Council, July 20, 2022.Archived July 29, 2022.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/72tho

The IFA’s national livestock chairman Angus Woods strongly rejected policy scenarios published by Ireland’s independent Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC), whichexploredways to help the country cut its agricultural emissions by cutting cattle numbers.The scenarios estimated the impact of cutting the number of beef suckler cows in the national herd by 15, 30, or 53 percent by 2030 relative to 2018 emissions, while keeping dairy cow numbers at the 2018 level.71“Annual Review 2019,” Climate Change Advisory Council, July, 2019.Archived February 22, 2021.

Following engagement with experts including agriculture specialists, the assembly’s randomly chosen Irish citizens endorsed a tax on greenhouse gases emitted by farms and “rewards for the farmer for land management that sequesters carbon”.
It also called on the government to “review and revise supports for land use diversification with attention to support for planting forests and encouraging organic farming”.
In an IFA press releasecommentingon the report, IFA then-president Joe Healy approved of Citizens’ Assembly points that would require greater government support for farmers, but he  described the Assembly’s carbon tax proposal as a “no go”.Healy also “called on all stakeholders to move on from the often divisive and unrealistic calls for Irish farmers to reduce their emission efficient model of dairy and beef production.”75“Carbon Tax a ‘No-Go’, but Some Useful Proposals in Citizens’ Assembly Report,” Irish Farmers’ Association, 2018.Archived November 29, 2020.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/7fRkj

Healy said that the agriculture sector had an “obligation in addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions”. In his speech, he also argued that focusing on improving the emissions intensity of meat and dairy production (the emissions per kg of milk or meat produced) was “the most appropriate climate barometer for agriculture”.
In 2023, analysis from state agriculture research agencyTeagasc,foundthat measures to increase efficiency had also increased productivity, resulting in a very large “backfire” rebound effect that had substantially increased dairy emissions.82Gary Lanigan, Kevin Hanrahan, Richards, K.G.. “An Updated Analysis of the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Potential of the Irish Agriculture and Land-Use Sectors between 2021 and 2030,” Teagasc, July, 2023.Archived October 9, 2023.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/X2JmZ",,,,,,,,,,,,"The IFA is one of the most active lobby groups in Ireland, submitting annual returns for around 200 meetings, letters and other interactions on agriculture, environment, and land use issues.84“The Irish Farmers’ Association – IFA,” Lobbying.ie.Archived August 6, 2024.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/rm96n

In aMay 2021 blog post, IFA’s dairy committee chair Stephen Arthur said: “There is a growing disconnect between farmers and consumers of dairy. We as farmers need to demonstrate and reassure consumers that Irish dairy is not only nutritious but also environmentally sustainable.”107“IFA Meet NDC on Their Latest Campaign,” Irish Farmers’ Association, May 25, 2021.Archived March 5, 2024.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/4d5kT
He continued: “We need a united voice through the NDC to cut through all the hype and demonstrate that dairy farmers are global leaders when it comes to producing milk efficiently”.

The Irish livestock sectoraccounts for38 percent of national GHG emissions and 99 percent of ammonia air pollution, while nitrate and phosphate nutrient losses from the livestock sector are the largest contributor to water body pollution.32“Ireland’s Provisional Greenhouse Gas Emissions 1990-2023 [landing page].” EPA.

January 21, 2020. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/GWM5f
However, in 2021 the European Court of Auditorspresentedevidence that efficiency measures had so far failed to cut emissions. It stated that due to its growing livestock herd, Ireland had “seen substantial emissions increases”.34“Common Agricultural Policy and climate: Half of EU climate spending but farm emissions are not decreasing,” European Court of Auditors. June, 2021.Archived June 21, 2021.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/YihLRIn a December 2022 blog post, then-IFA President Tim Cullinan responded to the Irish government’s Climate Action Plan,sayingthat further engagement was needed with farmers “to ensure we can reduce emissions while developing our sector.”35“Govt Must Engage with Farmers to Agree Way Forward on Climate Action & Food Production,” Irish Farmers Association, December 21, 2022.Archived December 5, 2023.

Cullinan argued that the debate around climate policy had become “unnecessarily divisive with far too much focus on cattle numbers”, adding: “The focus must be on reducing emissions, not on reducing cattle numbers.”
The IFA frequently emphasises the sustainability of Irish farmers and farming. In May 2021, “inresponseto media commentary around agriculture”36“Environment & Rural Affairs Council Report June 2021,” Irish Farmers’ Association, June 9, 2021.Archived June 30, 2021.

The IFA’s “Green Credentials” document also stated that “Irish dairy and beef output is extremely efficient from a carbon footprint perspective”, emphasising the ability of agriculture to sequester carbon in soil, and pointing to the relatively low amount of energy used in Ireland’s largely grass-based farming.
However, agriculture’s ability to sequester carbon on a timescale long enough to address climate change has beenrefutedby academic research.38Joe Fassler. “Research Undermines Claims that Soil Carbon Can Offset Livestock Emissions,”DeSmog, February 1, 2024.Other studies suggests Irish beef and milk ­production is not particularly carbon efficient when compared to other EU nations.

The IFA document also suggested that “methane emissions from our livestock and dairy sectors, which are biogenic in nature, merit differentiated treatment with regard to climate change [relative to fossil methane]”. IFA also noted that Ireland’s 2021 Climate Action & Low Carbon Development Bill “recognises the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane”, due to “strong engagement” from the IFA.
However,researchreviewing the most recent IPCC scientific assessment found that, apart from “relatively minor accounting differences”, cutting methane emissions from agriculture is just as important as cutting methane from fossil fuel sources in national climate action consistent with meeting the Paris Agreement temperature goal.42Paul Price. “Carbon budgeting literature review: AR6-WGI addendum.

The statement outlined steps that the AFCC’s members were taking to address climate change. Grain association COCERAL stated that “safe crop protection solutions [pesticides] placed on the EU market, together with qualified advisory to farmers and growers, help meet the productivity goals under the Farm to Fork, thereby providing safe, affordable food for the EU population.”
CropLife Europecalled for “a regulatory framework that supports innovation in agriculture which will help deliver the European green and digital transformations. EU authorisation giving timely access to a variety of innovative crop protection solutions [pesticides] is the most important part of farmers’ ability to improve quality, market access and tradability of fresh produce.”
According toFertilizers Europe, “the European fertilizer industry plays a vital role in ensuring a resilient European agriculture and in providing citizens with affordable and nutritious food. Increased nutrient use efficiency will be key to meet Europe’s ambitious goal of reducing nutrient losses while ensuring no deterioration of soil fertility.”22“Farm to Fork Strategy: how to reach the targets?,” Agri-Food Chain Coalition, January 27, 2022.Archived November 9, 2022.

Timothy A. Wise, an agricultural development specialist and a senior researcher at the Small Planet Institute, has criticised AGRA’s ties to big corporations, writing in a 2019 opinion piece inWiredthat “agribusiness, under the banner of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, lobbies governments to subsidize expanding fossil-fuel-based fertilizers and commercial seeds.”5Timothy A. Wise. “Big Ag Is Sabotaging Progress on Climate Change”,Wired, August 28, 2019.Archived November 9, 2020. Archive.vn URL:https://archive.vn/y6cbw
“In Malawi, for example, 40 to 60 percent of the government’s agricultural budget funds these subsidies for farmers to purchase commercial products they otherwise couldn’t afford. They don’t end up getting enough of a yield increase to pay for the inputs, and their land becomes more acidic, less fertile, with the repeated corn crops fed by these fertilizers.” he says. “At best, this wastes scarce government resources. At worst, this perpetuates the kind of unsustainable, fossil-fuel-intensive agriculture the IPCC [U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] is warning us about.”
A 2020reportby policy group Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung, which draws on Wise’s research, revealed the “false promises” that came with AGRA and wrote that the Alliance promotes a “one-dimensional, input-intensive and resource-intensive agricultural system”. The report also looked at ways in which technology has been a driving force in AGRA’s Green Revolution model; “its high use of energy-intensive resources is not sustainable: not only in terms of the dramatic effects on biodiversity and soil fertility, but also the high emissions of greenhouse gases and the use of synthetic fertilizers.”6Abdallah Mkindi et al. “False Promises: The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa”,Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung, June 2020.Archived November 9, 2020.

Sherman’s 1865 Special Field Order 15, which distributedland and farm animals to freed slavesthrough the Freedmen’s Bureau after the Civil War (President Andrew Jackson, however, later intervened and ordered the land in Georgia and South Carolina distributed back to Confederate farmers,resulting in the dispossessionof thousands of Black families.)15Allison Winter. “Farm Bureau Fires Back Against Climate Bill’s ‘Power Grab‘,”E&E News,January 11, 2010.Archived September 15, 2020.Archive.fo URL:https://archive.fo/UrZWc16Sarah McCammon. “The Story Behind ’40 Acres And A Mule’,”NPR, January 12, 2015.Archived September 15, 2020.Archive.fo URL:https://archive.fo/rctrV17Jeff Neumann and Tracy Matsue Loeffelholz. “40 Acres and a Mule Would Be at Least .4 Trillion Today—What the U.S. Really Owes Black America,”Yes!

In 2009, Stallman declared that the earth was cooling intestimonybefore the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Stallman acknowledged, however, that “carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing and that man-made emissions have increased for a number of decades,” but followed up by saying “those aren’t the only facts, and they don’t tell the whole story.”19Kevin Grandia, “Farm Bureau President Bob Stallman Believes in Global Cooling,”Desmog, July 16, 2009.
According to a 2013 Scientific Americanarticle, Mace Thornton, a spokesman for the AFBF said, “we’re not convinced that the climate change we’re seeing is anthropogenic in origin.

In 2020, the EU introduced its Farm to Fork strategy for green farming reforms in Europe. The package included a target to reduce antibiotic use in livestock farming by 50 percent by 2030.
In March 2020, two months before the publication of Farm to Fork, AnimalhealthEuropepublisheda paper on the topic, which stated: “we strongly oppose the imposition of absolute reduction targets which would place at risk animals in need of antibiotic treatment”, stating that antibiotic use was already decreasing in the bloc. “Particular care should be taken even with the setting of aspirational goals for reducing sales of antibiotics as bacterial diseases must be treated efficiently in order to ensure good health and welfare,” it said.32“Discussion Paper in preparation for EU Farm to Fork Strategy Proposal,” AnimalhealthEurope.Archived August 29, 2023.

In January 2023, AnimalhealthEuroperespondedto a public consultation on EU plans to ban the import of animal products from countries outside the EU (“third countries”) produced with lower standards for antibiotic use. The draft regulations would ban imports of products produced with antibiotics to promote growth; or which used antibiotics considered critical to human health by the EU. Imported products would need to be from a country of origin approved by the EU and have a certificate of compliance.
AnimalhealthEurope warned that “this precludes operators from those countries who may not make the effort to be included on the list from exporting to the EU, even if their production system is fully compliant with the rules in the EU regarding the use of antimicrobials.”
It warned that overly “prescriptive” clauses could “jeopardise ongoing efforts to secure sustainable food systems globally and undermine the effectiveness of EU development policies,” and argued that trade standards needed to allow for differences in country circumstances. It also warned that “non-scientifically justified application of EU standards to imports” could lead to retaliation from third country governments, including possible restrictions on EU exports, and even undermine the work of global standard setting bodies like the intergovernmental World Organisation on Animal Health (WOAH).42“Feedback from: AnimalhealthEurope,” European Commission, January 1, 2023.Archived August 30, 2023.

On an April 2021 Euractiv panel, AHE secretary general Roxanne Feller stated, “no antibiotic is ever approved without the approval and prescription of a vet.

Europe has the strictest laws on farm antibiotic use worldwide. However, data suggests that antibiotics are still overused in Europe. According to a 2022 reportpublishedby the civil society organisation European Public Health Alliance, group treatments accounted for around 87 percent of veterinary antibiotic sales in Europe in 2020. The report pointed out that countries with the highest percentage of antibiotics given as group treatments tended to be those that were high farm antibiotic users overall. “A possible explanation for this is that these high users are relying on antibiotics as a routine preventative treatment and using these particularly important medicines as management tools, rather than as treatments that should be kept in reserve for when they are really needed,” the report said.23Cóilín Nunan. “Ending routine farm antibiotic use in Europe.

During the April 2021 Euractiv panel, Feller also stated, “we [AnimalhealthEurope] have absolutely no preconception of what type of farming system is the one that is best [for keeping animals healthy].

However, scientists haverecognisedthat the crowded conditions associated with intensive animal farming increase antibiotic use because they increase the risk of disease.25Thomas P. Van Boeckel, Charles Brower, Marius Gilbert and Ramanan Laxminarayan, “Global trends in antimicrobial use in food animals”, in PNAS, March 19, 2015.Archived August 29, 2023. Archived URL:https://archive.ph/9psT4Specific practices associated with intensive farming have also been found to increase preventative antibiotic use. For example, antibiotics are often given preventatively to piglets who are weaned from their mothers early, which can cause diarrhoea and other sickness.26M. Sjölund, M. Postma, L. Collineau, S. Lösken, A. Backhans, C. Belloc, U. Emanuelson, E.Groβe Beilage, K. Stärk, J.

During the Euractiv panel, Feller also claimed that “Not so many animals are resistant to antibiotics, it’s usually the humans.”27“Reducing the use of antibiotics in the meat sector,” YouTube video uploaded by user Euractiv, April 21, 2021. Archived .mp4 on file at DeSmog.
On its website, the organisation also emphasises the role of human antibiotic use in the increase of antimicrobial resistance over farm use. For example, AHE cited the UK government’s five-year antimicrobial strategy, which stated: “Increasing scientific evidence suggests that the clinical issues with antimicrobial resistance that we face in human medicine are primarily the result of antibiotic use in people, rather than the use of antibiotics in animals.”28“Reducing the use of antibiotics in the meat sector”, YouTube video uploaded by user Euractiv, April 21, 2021. Archived .mp4 on file at DeSmog.
Experts told DeSmog that while the over- and misuse of antibiotics in human medical settings is indeed the biggest factor driving antimicrobial resistance, reducing the overuse of antibiotics in livestock farming also has a role to play in curbing the threat.
Thomas Van Boeckel, a spatial epidemiologist at Swiss university ETH Zürich, likened the constant use of antibiotics in livestock production to “playing the lottery.”
“You play the lottery three times more in animals than you do in humans, because they use three times more antibiotics. Now, that doesn’t mean that every nasty resistant gene that emerges in animals makes its way to [becoming] a human adapted pathogen,” he said. “But it can be seen as a very unnecessary risk, given how precious antibiotics are for humans.”
Roxane Feller, the AnimalhealthEurope secretary-general, told DeSmog in a statement that the animal health sector supports antibiotic stewardship and “responsible use of all medicines.” Feller emphasised that the industry has reduced antibiotic use by prioritising “preventative practices” including vaccination and nutrition, adding: “We are actively working with partners across the livestock value chain to reduce the need for antibiotic use for animal health purposes.”
“The animal health industry in Europe acknowledges its responsibility and remains firmly committed to playing an active role in addressing this One Health challenge of antibiotic resistance,” she said.",,"The AnimalhealthEurope website states that the organisation supports “Europe’s ambitions in the EU Green Deal to move towards a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system”.

Experts contest claims that animal health reduces emissions overall. While animals that are healthy are more productive, antibiotics and other animal health products have been central to the boom in intensive animal farming over recent decades – whichincreasedby 45 percent between 2000 and 2020.10“Global animal farming, meat production and meat consumption,” De Statis, 2022.Archived August 29, 2023.

In response to the announcement of the Farm to Fork strategy, BASFpublisheda document titled “Feedback on the Farm to Fork Roadmap Strategy” on its website. The document stated that BASF supported the European Green Deal and the “ambitious and holistic approach” of the Farm to Fork strategy, and that “plant sciences, agricultural technologies, including Climate Smart Agriculture as well as innovative animal feed additives have an important role to play in meeting these objectives.”50“BASF – Feedback on the Farm to Fork Strategy Roadmap,” BASF.

The document also stated that BASF “acknowledge[d] the Commission’s objective to reduce both risk and use of pesticides based on societal concerns and demands,” but argued that “research in plant science has enabled production of safe and sustainable food, increased yields, reduced food loss, and extended the shelf life of agricultural products,” and suggested that “advances” in pesticide technologies have “reduced application volumes by 95%” while “reducing naturally occurring health risks, such as carcinogenic mycotoxins in food.”
However, pesticide use in Europe was largely “stable” between 2011 and 2020,according toPesticide Action Network,51“Pesticide Use in Europe,” Pesticide Action Network Europe.Archived December 5, 2022.

BASF’s response to Farm to Fork also argued that “moving to 100% organic farming would result in an increase of greenhouse gas emissions” if the total area of land used for agricultural production “had to be increased to compensate for reduced productivity” that could result if pesticide use was reduced.53“BASF – Feedback on the Farm to Fork Strategy Roadmap,” BASF.

The document also claimed that “for every kilogram of CO2 equivalent invested in the manufacture and use of plant protection products [pesticides and herbicides], at least 10 kilograms of the gas is removed from the atmosphere thanks to [crop] yield increase.”
While the EU has set targets to increase the amount of organically farmed land in the EU to 25 percent by 2030, it currently has no targets to transition to 100 percent organic agriculture.54“BASF – Feedback on the Farm to Fork Strategy Roadmap,” BASF.

Tedeschi alsoarguedthat policies to support sustainable food production should “shift the focus from [agrochemical] reduction to innovation,” writing: “Looking back at the two years, we see some initial steps in the right direction, however the main focus of the Farm to Fork strategy and its first implementation measures is still more on reduction targets than on new technologies.

In March 2022, corporate watchdog group Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) released a report thatstatedBASF was one of the pesticide companies involved in “a counter-lobby of huge proportions” against the EU Farm to Fork strategy.61“A loud lobby for a silent spring: The pesticide industry’s lobbying tactics against Farm to Fork,”Corporate Europe Observatory,March 17, 2022.Archived July 26, 2022.

The report questioned whether the industry was “co-opting” Integrated Pest Management (IPM, an integrated system for managing pests, diseases, and weeds favored by the EU) “as a route for agri-industry false solutions.” Corporate Europe Observatory wrote: “In a lobby meeting of CropLife Europe (attended by BASF,Corteva,Bayer, andSyngenta) with the Commission, the option was even raised that EU member states would approve IPM crop-specific guidelines designed by industry.” CEO commented that “it would be a recipe-for-failure if vested pesticide interests were allowed to draft any IPM guidelines.”
BASF and others have also lobbied on the 2022 revision of the EU’s Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive (SUD), which was reviewed in order to align it with Farm to Fork targets.
In BASF’s response to the public consultation on the revision, it indicated that it “strongly disagreed” with the a statement in the consultation that read: “It is necessary to reduce the use of chemical pesticides in the EU.”62“Contributions: Pesticides – sustainable use (updated EU rules)”,European Commission, January 18, 2021 – April 12, 2021.

Economic viability is also part of the sustainability equation.”
In a June 2020 article in Ag News, whichdiscussedthe Farm to Fork pesticide reduction target,  Livio Tedeschi wrote: “chemical crop protection products are one of the biggest drivers of agricultural productivity. Such a reduction would lead to considerably lower productivity per hectar of land, if not replaced by alternative solutions. Better management of the food supply chain and food waste will help, but certainly not close the gap.”72Livio Tedeschi. “Why the EU’s Farm to Fork Strategy is a unique chance to radically change agriculture and food production,” Ag News, June 4, 2020.Archived December 7, 2022.

Tedeschi also argued that “technologies such as precision farming” can “lead to a reduction of risk and use of pesticides, contribute to a lower CO2 footprint and increase biodiversity,” but cautioned that the EU would have to “create the regulatory and legal environment for them to thrive.”
He added: “Regulatory restrictions slowing down the introduction of new-generation crop protection products or high hurdles for advanced breeding techniques, for example, will have to be reconsidered if we want a realistic path towards the Farm to Fork goals.”73Livio Tedeschi. “Why the EU’s Farm to Fork Strategy is a unique chance to radically change agriculture and food production,” Ag News, June 4, 2020.Archived December 7, 2022.

The report stated that if ratified, the deal “will heavily increase crop exports to Europe, and imports of dangerous agrochemicals to South America, particularly Brazil,” and that the potential for increased agricultural exports “risks aggravating existing problems with the conversion of forests and other important ecosystems for agriculture, and adds to the toxic burden of pesticide-intensive agriculture on nature and local communities.”
The report also highlighted that European agrochemical giants including BASF andBayer“have been promoting the EU-Mercosur trade deal through lobby groups” and “sought to increase market access for some of their most harmful pesticides by joining forces with Brazilian agribusiness associations.” The report claimed that European companies work with agribusiness lobby groups like CropLife Brasil (which was founded by Bayer and is associated with BASF) to water down environmental policies, writing: “Their joint lobby efforts have borne fruit: pesticide use has multiplied sixfold over the last 20 years and a record number of new pesticides has been approved in Brazil since Jair Bolsonaro came to power.”
The report added that Bayer and BASF have benefitted from the proposed deal and government support for pesticides, writing: “Together, Bayer and BASF have got 45 new pesticides approved over the last three years, 19 of which contain substances prohibited in the European Union.”75Larissa Mies Bombardi, Audrey Changoe. “Toxic Trading: The EU pesticide lobby’s offensive in Brazil,” Friends of the Earth Europe and Seattle to Brussels Network, April 2022.Archived September 6, 2022.

In October 2021, days before the European Parliament’s vote on Farm to Fork, a website “powered by Bayer and Syngenta” called Swiss Foodpublishedan article titled “Agricultural production in the EU to drop by 20 percent.” It claimed that the European Green Deal would “reduce the amount of agricultural production in the EU and lower farmers’ incomes” while the EU would be forced to “import more agricultural goods” while “consumers would pay higher prices.” The article added: “Moreover, land use would increase in the rest of the world.

Bayer has also lobbied on the 2022 revision of the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive (SUD). Since its inception in 2009, SUD has suggested that pesticides should only be used as a “last resort” intervention on farms. During 2022, SUD was reviewed by the European Commission to align it with Farm to Fork targets, and to make a 50 percent pesticide reduction target legally binding.
Bayersubmitteda public consultation response to the Commission’s proposal for the SUD revision in September 2022, arguing against SUD’s longstanding suggestion that pesticides should be a last resort. Bayer said this approach risked “having a severely detrimental effect on agricultural production” and “denies the fact that chemical crop protection today plays an important role before, during and after the growing cycle.” Bayer called for revisions to the proposal that pesticides should be banned in sensitive areas such as public parks, arguing that the Commission’s current approach risked “alienating” farmers, and argued against suggestions that Member States should target reductions at the five most widely used pesticides in their countries.
Bayer also suggested that the Revision should focus on supporting innovations, such as digital and precision farming, and use of drone technologies.112Bayer AG. “Our views on Sustainable Use of Pesticides Regulation,” European Commission, September 19, 2022.

COPA-COGECA has also lobbied on findings of the long-awaited assessment of the Farm to Fork Strategy released by the EU Commission’s in-house science service in August 2021. Like the industry funded studies, the report predicted significant yield falls as a result of Farm to Fork, but has also been criticized for serious shortcomings. One of the authors of the JCR study themselves claimed that the data did not give a “comprehensive view” of the impacts of Farm to Fork, because it only focused on certain aspects of the strategy.72Magdalena Pistorius. “Farm to Fork studies do not give ‘whole picture’, agri stakeholders warn,”EURACTIV,October 29, 2021.Archived November 6, 2021.

In October 2021, two weeks ahead of the final vote on the European Parliament’s report on the Farm to Fork Strategy, COPA-COGECA, through the Belgian Federation of Agriculture (FWA), sent an email to the entire French-speaking Belgian delegation advocating for radical changes in the report in favor of agri-business, asking the delegation to support the rejection of six out of the 48 amendments being proposed, including the use reduction targets for pesticides and fertilizers.76Email shared with DeSmog by source in the European Parliament, 2021.
The documents were leaked by Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO), which alsosharedCOPA-COGECA’s documents and claimed the group was involved in a “coordinated attack” by industrial agri-food lobbies on the EU’s sustainable food policies. Within the document shared by CEO, COPA-COGECA said it believed that reports and studies utilized by the European Commission were not exhaustive, stating: “we believe that it would be interesting to also invite for this hearing researchers from the Wageningen University who are finalising as we speak an impact assessment on the Farm to Fork”.77“Leak: industrial farm lobbies’ coordinated attack on Farm to Fork targets,”Corporate Europe Observatory, October 12, 2021.Archived November 29, 2021.

COPA-COGECA has also joined other trade lobby groups in calling for further impact assessments of Farm to Fork and its measures. In May 2021, COPA-COGECAsignedan open letter with many other trade groups, stating: “Without a comprehensive impact assessment, we will not be celebrating the one-year anniversary of the Farm to Fork strategy.” The statement requested: “to have a policy based on concrete data and scientific evidence that is in line with the better regulation principles, not on ideology and political stances,” implying that the current measures were not data-based.78“Joint Declaration on the anniversary of the Farm to Fork strategy”, Animalhealth Europe.Archived December 20, 2022.

Genetic modification can make crops more resistant to certain environmental conditions, including pests, chemicals, diseases and weather. While some scientists and industry representatives argue that more widespread use of gene editing techniques will lead to significant environmental benefits, the environmental impacts of these technologies are currently contested.51Nicholas G.

One studysuggeststhat while the widespread adoption of genetically modified crops has decreased the use of insecticides, it may have also increased the need for weed-killing herbicides as weeds became more resistant. According to the study, which looked at 14 years of farm-level data from across the US, farmers that used genetically modified soybean crops used 28 percent more herbicides than those that did not. The study found that while herbicide use had slightly decreased for maize farmers using genetically modified crops, the usage of herbicides by maize farmers in the industry as a whole had increased, indicating that weed-resistance overall had risen.53Caroline Newman.“Largest-Ever Study Reveals Environmental Impact of Genetically Modified Crops,” UVATODAY, September 14, 2016.Archived October 29, 2021.

During the June 2019 Corteva Open Innovation Forum, the companypromoteda message from Dr. Ernst van den Ende, Managing Director of the Plant Sciences Group at Wageningen University & Research (WUR). In response to the question “Why do you think young people should be more involved in the public dialogue on plant-breeding?” van den Ende said: “What I see is that a lot of the younger people are far more open to technologies. And they can be of influence in the political debate about this technology. And I think, especially the younger students in biotech, they are far better in trying to bridge the people of the NGOs, the political parties, to make this a better world, together.” The video ends with a message from Corteva that reads: “The younger generation of plant breeders can help bring science and society together, to solve future food challenges.”61“Dr Ernst van den Ende, Wageningen University, at Corteva Open Innovation Forum,” YouTube video uploaded by user Corteva Agriscience, June 14, 2019.

Dairy Cares has argued against California legislation that would target more aggressive greenhouse gas emissions reductions by 2030. An August 24 article in Agri-Pulse, an online agriculture newspaper,quotedBoccadero as saying, “California seems hell bent on passing the Inflation Acceleration Act. They have huge economic ramifications for not just the business community, but every resident in the state. And, frankly, the impacts will be hardest on the low-income Californians who can least afford it.”40Brad Hooker. “Bills to watch in the California Legislature’s final week,”Agri-Pulse,August 24, 2022.Archived October 14, 2022.

Archive URL:https://archive.is/OLehMThe researchers are UC Davis professors Ermias Kebreab, Frank Mitloehner, and Daniel Sumner. According to the project proposal’s objective statement, the research is intended “to document the progress to date for voluntary, incentive-based approaches to dairy methane reduction, with a focus on California.”
The project proposal’s anticipated “industry benefit(s)” include: “Maintain voluntary incentive-based approaches; better respond to environmental justice criticisms; encourage continued dairy methane reduction funding; maximize carbon reductions in the dairy supply chain and establish California dairy as a world leader in planet-smart dairy.”

Support for Natural Gas Market Incentives in California
In the wake of SB 1383’s passage in 2016, in February 2017 Boccadorooutlineda plan for the dairy industry to influence California’s methane reduction strategy.42Michael Boccadoro. “Opportunities and Challenges for reducing methane from manure management at California Dairies,” Gladstein, Neandross & Associates, February 2017.Archived October 12, 2022.

In 2021, in response to Brussels’ plans on land use and land change, EuroChem sent the European Commission a paper exploring possible policy approaches: intensification and “extensification,” or expanding the amount of land used for food production.42Thomas Mannheim, Catarina Henka, EuroChem. “Intensive Landwirtschaft und Schutz der Biodiversität – Ein Widerspruch?

The paper, which EuroChem had published in 2019, argued that synthetic fertilizers had a role to play in “sustainable intensification,” through targeted use contributing “significantly to high yields” without increasing the amount of land devoted to food production. By contrast, according to the paper, agricultural practices that minimized or eliminated use of synthetic fertilizers, such as organic farming, would lead to conversion of more land to agricultural use to achieve the same yields, further harming biodiversity and climate:43Thomas Mannheim, Catarina Henka, EuroChem. “Intensive Landwirtschaft und Schutz der Biodiversität – Ein Widerspruch?

Academics, NGOs and policy makers have sharply challenged claims that intensification can provide a climate and biodiversity solution.
In 2015, the CGIAR research program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security examined whether ‘sustainable intensification’ could sufficiently reduce the emissions from agriculture. Itfoundthat: “Neither business-as-usual intensification of agriculture nor moderate adoption of mitigation practices will reduce emissions enough to avoid a 2-degree C temperature increase in 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels.”47Julianna White, “Sustainable intensification will not keep us within the 2-degree goal for 2030,”CGIAR research program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security, April 9, 2015.Archived July 28, 2022.

The EUhas settargets to reduce chemical fertilizer use by 20 percent by 2030.22“Nutrients: Commission seeks views on better management,” European Commission, June 3, 2022.Archived September 25, 2022. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/u8cXk","The Carbon+ Farming Coalition promotes carbon markets as an economic response to climate change.
An April 2022 report published by the World Economic Forumclaimedthat farmers could get five times the “economic benefits” from adopting “climate-smart practices,” such as carbon farming, if they are “complemented by broader market-based incentives that are inclusive of societal benefits, such as carbon credits and price premiums, along with public subsidies.”23“Transforming Food Systems with Farmers: A Pathway for the EU,” World Economic Forum, April 2022.Archived October 26, 2022. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
The report was “developed with the support” of the Carbon+ Farming coalition “in response to a call from the Executive Vice President of the European Commission leading on the EU Green Deal.”
However, multiple NGOs and academics have sounded the alarm about carbon markets.
Scientifically, thereare“significant disagreements about what it will take to accurately measure and certify that farms are actually removing and storing increased amounts of carbon dioxide,” and there is alimitto how much carbon can be stored in soil.24James Temple. “Why we can’t count on carbon-sucking farms to slow climate change,” MIT Technology Review, June 3, 2020.Archived December 5, 2022.

Carbon markets have also been sharply criticized by environmental NGOs and the environmental justice movement. The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) hassaidthat carbon markets “let companies off the hook from reducing their own pollution and associated damage to public health,” which is especially concerning as “many sources of greenhouse gas pollution also emit other toxic air pollutants that affect human health” and “many of those pollution sources are located in communities of color.”26Ben Lilliston. “Lessons for the EU’s carbon farming plans,” Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, June 16, 2022.Archived October 26, 2022.

ELV has alsowrittenthat, “animals have the right to be treated in the best possible way to avoid unnecessary suffering” when they get sick, and that “it should always be up to the veterinarian to decide the optimum way to administer medication, which remains under veterinary control and prescription.”
In April 2022, the groupstated: “Animal health and welfare standards are higher in the EU than anywhere else in the world. The EU has stringent inspections on residues of veterinary medicines and contaminants in animal source food and an overall monitoring system, which show a compliance of the sector with all safety standards close to 100%.”56“European Livestock Farming Shouldering its Responsibility to Keep Antibiotics Working,” Meat the Facts, April 1, 2022.Archived August 24, 2023.

Europe has the strictest laws on farm antibiotic use worldwide. However, data suggests that animal antibiotics are still overused in Europe. According to a 2022 reportpublishedby the civil society organisation European Public Health Alliance, group treatments accounted for around 87 percent of veterinary antibiotic sales in Europe in 2020. The report pointed out that countries with the highest percentage of antibiotics given as group treatments tended to be high farm antibiotic users overall. “A possible explanation for this is that these high users are relying on antibiotics as a routine preventative treatment and using these particularly important medicines as management tools, rather than as treatments that should be kept in reserve for when they are really needed,” it said.57“Ending routine farm antibiotic use in Europe.

It’s a great shock figure that is often quoted, but the gross tonnage that is used to get this figure is a poor way to compare the use of antibiotics in humans and animals.

European Livestock Voice warns, “an even more stringent ban on antibiotics in animals than scientifically judged will have little effect on antibiotic resistance resolution.

EU Legislation on Seed Treatment Technologies
Euroseeds has also lobbied specifically on seed treatment technologies in EU legislation. Euroseedswritesthat seed treatment involves applying “plant protection products [pesticides, fungicides, and/or herbicides] directly to the seed itself” prior to sowing in order to “protect the seed during germination and protect the plant itself during growth.” Euroseedsclaimsthat seed treatment is “more environmentally friendly than spraying crops in the field.”55“Seed Treatment And Technologies,” Euroseeds.Archived October 4, 2022.

Euroseeds has also suggested that seed treatments have a role in meeting EU pesticides targets. In a 2022responseto the EU Regulation on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides (SUR), Euroseeds suggested that seed treatment technologies could help reach the legislation’s goal: “Seed treatment technologies are fully compatible to the integrated pest management (IPM) principles, while contributing to delivering resilient and healthy plants for the benefit of society.”58“Euroseeds position on the Regulation on the Sustainable Use of Pesticide,” Euroseeds, June 23, 2022.Archived July 4, 2022.

What Is Gene Editing?
Gene editing in agriculture is theprocessof adding, enhancing, or removing specific traits from the DNA of an organism, in order to make it more resistant to pests, diseases, weather, and other problems that can lower crop yields. Gene editing and other “plant breeding technologies” are considered forms of genetic modification under current EU law.46Kai Purnhagen and Justus Wesseler. “EU Regulation of New Plant Breeding Technologies and Their Possible Economic Implications for the EU and Beyond,” Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, September 28, 2020.Archived July 26, 2022.

Some studiesconcludethat there is still not enough data in order to assess the long term safety of such new crops, nor their environmental impact.47Aristidis M. Tsatsakis, Muhammad Amjad Nawaz, Demetrios Kouretas, Georgios Balias, Kai Savolainen, Victor A. Tutelyan, Kirill S.

Scientists, NGOs and industry members have widely debated whether gene editing should be considered a form of genetic modification. Proponents of gene editingsaythat it differs from genetic modification because it does not introduce DNA from other species “and creates new varieties similar to those that could be produced more slowly by natural breeding processes.”48“Press release: Plans to unlock power of gene editing unveiled,” Gov.uk, September 29, 2021.Archived July 26, 2022.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/RnjAL

Ammonia emissions are associated with two major types of environmental problems:acidification and eutrophication. Acidification refers to dropping pH levels in soil, marine or freshwater habitats. , It is caused primarily by increased absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere, and can harm the physiology of organisms in those environments. . Eutrophication takes place when  environments are disproportionately enriched with minerals and nutrients, causing the excessive growth of plants such as algae.  Itis often caused by heavy levels of nitrogen-rich agricultural runoff. In Europe, about70 percentof agricultural land in the EU uses excessive nutrients, harming water quality and biodiversity.58“A climate-dependent global model of ammonia emissions from chicken farming,” Jize Jiang , David S.

There has been widespread debate regarding the risk of glyphosate to human health. In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO)foundthat glyphosate was a probable human carcinogen. In contrast, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) do not classify glyphosate as carcinogenic. The EFSA’s decision was widely criticized: it was believed to have relied on undisclosed industry studies alongside published scientific papers. In 2017, it wasfoundthat entire sections of the risk report had been “copy-pasted directly from industry’s original application.”99“The Glyphosate Story so far: Controversy over Science, Lawsuits and Dodgy Lobbying Tactics,” Corporate Europe Observatory, Health and Environmental Alliance, Global 2000, and PAN Germany, July 2021.Archived August 23, 2022.

In September 2022, Bayerfundedan Impact Assessment “of the loss of glyphosate within the EU” by environmental consultancy ADAS. According to the study, it was “supported by the Glyphosate Renewal Group.”
The study found that without glyphosate, EU farmers could experience billions of pounds in yield losses. It concluded: “Yield losses and increased farm level-costs will affect the global competitiveness of EU agriculture, the ability of the EU to be self-sufficient in food, and the trade balance contributions of agricultural commodities that are exported.” However, the study did not consider negative impacts of glyphosate on health or the environment – or any associated economic costs – instead listing its “environmental benefits.”42Sarah Wynn and Elise Webb. “Impact assessment of the loss of glyphosate within the EU: a literature review,” Environmental Sciences Europe, September 2022.Archived October 11, 2022.

The negative impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity have been widely recognized. One landmark study published in the scientific journalNaturein 2015 tested 30 different wheat crop models at varying temperatures. Its findingssuggestedthat “warming is already slowing yield gains at a majority of wheat-growing locations,” and that “global wheat production is estimated to fall by 6 [percent] for each °C of further temperature increase and become more variable over space and time.”15Asseng, S., Ewert, F., Martre, P. et al. “Rising temperatures reduce global wheat production,”Nature Climate Change5, 143–147, 2015.https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2470
Some studies also suggest that high temperatures and elevated CO2 levels could make glyphosate less effective on weeds, with one studyfindingreduced effectiveness of glyphosate on both horseweed and white goosefoot. This has led researchers to believe that in a warmer climate with more atmospheric CO2, more glyphosate would have to be used to achieve the desired herbicidal effects.16Matzrafi, M., Brunharo, C., Tehranchian, P. et al. “Increased temperatures and elevated CO2 levels reduce the sensitivity of Conyza canadensis and Chenopodium album to glyphosate,” Sci Rep 9, 2228 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-38729-x

Synthetic fertilizers rely on fossil fuels, predominantly using natural gas as a feedstock during production.

According tothe Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL), synthetic pesticides and fertilizers actually harm food security due to “deleterious effects on soil biota,” ultimately “degrading natural cycles” and ensuring that food systems are dependent on ever greater inputs of chemicals in order to maintain yields.26Dana Drugmand, Steven Feit, Lili Fuhr, and Carroll Muffett, “Fossils, Fertilizers, and False Solutions: How Laundering Fossil Fuels in Agrochemicals Puts the Climate and the Planet at Risk,” Centre for International Environmental Law, October 2022.Archived November 1, 2022.

James said that JBS’s aim for net zero was incompatible with its plans to expand production.
JBS disagreed with the lawsuit, pledging to continue working with farmers and ranchers toward a “more sustainable future for agriculture” using fewer resources and with lower environmental impact.","According to a2020 reportpublished by the International Land Coalition (ILC), a global alliance of civil society and intergovernmental organisations, “the dramatic expansion of JBS […] is not just a story of ambition and business acumen, but is just as much one of how regulations can be circumvented and state resources mobilised to support the international expansion of a particular corporation.”43“UNEARTHING LESS VISIBLE TRENDS IN LAND INEQUALITY,”International Land Coalition.Archived July 16, 2021.

April 2009
In April 2009, the EPA released research-based findings that the accumulation of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere endangered public health in the present and the future. Known as the “endangerment finding,” this scientific conclusion meant that under the Clean Air Act, the EPA had the authority to regulate carbon pollution.

“It’s premature to issue this kind of finding, especially given the recent controversy surrounding the scientific validity of alleged human contributions to climate change. Regulation of greenhouse gases should be based on science, and it should be thoughtfully considered and voted on by Congress through a democratic process, not dictated by the EPA.”

However, the NCBA still opposed the bill, according to the primer, because it could cause increases in energy prices. The document closed with the promise that “NCBA will continue to fight the regulation of GHG emissions from cattle operations.”

Though the rule did directly require farms to report their emissions, it raised the possibility of requiring publicly traded companies to report both upstream and downstream emissions, known as “Scope 3” emissions. The NCBA and other agribusiness trade associationsfiled commentsin opposition to the rule, arguing that because the emissions involved in a publicly traded company’s value chain could include those from agriculture, small farms could face the burdensome task of reporting emissions.28Agricultural Retailers Association et al. “Re: Comments by National Agricultural Associations on SEC’s Proposed Rules on the Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors,” U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Archived June 27, 2022.

The first is by “boosting productivity and reducing emissions” which includes encouraging farmers to useprecision agriculturetechniques for crops “to deliver nutrients and crop protection more efficiently”. Within this, it also suggests gene editing “for disease resistance to improve health and productivity of crops and livestock and reduce emissions”. It also highlights measures such as controlled fertilizer release, using feed additives for ruminant livestock, loosening compacted soils and preventing soil compaction and implementing energy efficiency measures.8“Achieving Net Zero – Farming’s 2040 Goal,”National Farmers Union.

The NFU also encourages farmers to adopt carbon storage techniques by “improving land management and changing land use to capture more carbon” — key elements ofregenerative agriculture. This includes growing bigger hedgerows and planting more woodland. The report also suggests farmers can enhance soil carbon storage, and asks for support from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to develop a “network of demonstration farms and the development of a mechanism for reward payments.”9“Achieving Net Zero – Farming’s 2040 Goal,”National Farmers Union.

The NFU’s third pillar for achieving the goal of net zero emissions is encouraging the production of bioenergy and the use of bio-materials. The report says: “Boosting renewable energy and the bioeconomy to displace greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and to create GHG [greenhouse gas] removal through photosynthesis and carbon capture is a key part of the NFU ambition for achieving net zero.” Critics say thatbioenergyproduction increases competition for land, and uses land which is needed for carbon storage and food production.10“Achieving Net Zero – Farming’s 2040 Goal,”National Farmers Union.

Endocrine-disrupting pesticides like flumioxazin arerecognizedas leading causes of biodiversity loss. Flumioxazin has beenfoundto be highly toxic to algae and aquatic plants, and moderately toxic to earthworms, honey bees, fish and aquatic invertebrates. The substance can also accumulate over time within the organs and tissues of aquatic organisms, eventually increasing the concentration of flumioxazin to toxic levels.26“Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals and Climate Change: A Worst-Case Combination for Arctic Marine Mammals and Seabirds?,”National Center for Biotechnology, October 21, 2005.

The investigation reported on a cache of internal company documents that had been published during a court case in the US. According to the investigation, Syngenta “continues to export thousands of tonnes of paraquat each year from its factory in the north of England – although the UK, Switzerland and China have all banned its use on their own soil.” Syngenta states, according to the report, that it has “helped address the problem of accidental ingestion” by using a dye and smell first added to the pesticide in the 1970s, to warn people against drinking it, as well as an emetic to induce vomiting.76Crispin Dowler and Laurent Gaberell. “The Paraquat Papers: How Syngenta’s bad science helped keep the world’s deadliest weedkiller on the market,” Unearthed, March 24, 2021.Archived September 12, 2022.

Farm to Fork, which is part of the European Green Deal, includes 2030 targets to reduce the use and risk of chemical pesticides by 50 percent, reduce the use of fertilizers by 20 percent, and increase the amount of land under organic farming to 25 percent.
Syngenta has criticized the EU’s targets in its Farm to Fork strategy.
In October 2021, days before the European Parliament’s vote on Farm to Fork, a website “powered by Bayer and Syngenta” called Swiss Foodpublishedan article titled, “Agricultural production in the EU to drop by 20 percent”. It claimed, “The European Green Deal would reduce the amount of agricultural production in the EU and lower farmers’ incomes. At the same time, the EU would import more agricultural goods, and consumers would pay higher prices. Moreover, land use would increase in the rest of the world. This has been confirmed by several studies.”22“Agricultural production in the EU to drop by 20 percent,” Swiss Food, October 15, 2021.Archived December 7, 2022. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/teLSX

In a 2019 Politicoarticle, journalist Helena Bottemiller Evich wrote about a “closed-door meeting” hosted by the USFRA on how farmers are “waking up on climate change”. She wrote: “The veil of secrecy attested to just how sensitive the topic remains, but over the course of the two-day gathering, the group coalesced around big ideas like the need to pay farmers to use their land to draw down carbon from the atmosphere” — a regenerative agriculture strategy.33Helena Bottemiller Evich. “How a closed-door meeting shows farmers are waking up on climate change,”Politico, December 9, 2019.Archived September 15, 2020.

Lobby watchdog Corporate Europe Observatory asked why expected environmental benefits of the Farm to Fork strategy had not been included. WURstatedthat doing a full impact assessment was “unfortunately beyond the scope of the project” and that “partial assignments are part and parcel of WUR’s work, specific areas, such as economic impact are investigated this time, environmental impacts the next.”

Jeroen Candel, an associate professor of food and agricultural policy at WUR, criticized the research,writingon Twitter that the framing and headline of the research were “highly unfortunate,” and that although the report’s researchers “acknowledge that the benefits of climate and biodiversity have not been included, that is precisely what the entire [Farm to Fork] strategy is intended for.” Candel added that because the research was framed around whether or not Farm to Fork would impact agricultural yields, it was “not surprising that such studies are used as ammunition against the F2F by status quo forces.”38“Framing van het onderzoek, ook in de kop, is daarmee hoogst ongelukkig.

The second study conducted by Wageningen on Farm to Fork was funded by Copa-Cogeca, farm animal breeders lobby EFFAB, Animal Health Europe, poultry lobby group AVEC, feed manufacturers lobby FEFAC, and dairy lobby EDA – all members ofEuropean Livestock Voice.
The study modeled the possible impacts of Farm to Fork on livestock farmers’ income, finding that the Green Deal objectives could reduce livestock production by 10 to 15 percent. However, the report also found that almost half of farmers could see an increase in income.39Roel Jongeneel, Huib Silvis, Ana Gonzalez Martinez, Jakob Jager, “Impact of the EU’s Green Deal on the livestock sector: Executive Summary,”Wageningen University and Research.Archived December 17, 2022.

Neonicotinoid Report Controversy
According to 2020 reporting by Dutch investigative journalism outletFollow the Money,in 2011 Henk Bleker, then the Dutch State Secretary for Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation,askedWageningen University & Research to draw up independent advice for the Dutch House of Representatives on neonicotinoids and their impact on bee mortality rates.66Vincent Harmsen. “Belangenverstrengeling zaait twijfels over giftig zaad,”Follow the Money, January 10, 2020.Archived December 17, 2022. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/rUErMFollow the Moneyreported that a literature review of neonicotinoid studies led by a WUR researcher, “Plant Researchers Ph.D.” Tjeerd Blacquière, found that “the advent of neonics has not created an ‘unacceptable risk’ for bees,” instead naming a parasite called the Varroa mite as the primary cause of bee die-offs.
Follow the Moneyreported that Blacquiere’s conclusion was disputed “behind the scenes” by two Utrecht University scientists: Jereon Van der Sluijs and Marie José Duchateau. Van der Sluijs toldFollow the Moneythat the review had missed 14 key studies and relied on “methodically incorrectly designed field trials by…Bayer Cropscience.” Despite writing a letter to Bleker, their criticisms were omitted from the advice given to the Dutch House of Representatives, “despite the explicit promise of State Secretary Henk Bleker that they would be involved in the preparation of the report,” according toFollow the Money.67Vincent Harmsen. “Belangenverstrengeling zaait twijfels over giftig zaad,”Follow the Money, January 10, 2020.Archived December 17, 2022.

Follow the Moneyalsoexaminedadditional links between WUR and Bayer, finding that WUR’s Bee Institute had been “working together with the German pesticide manufacturer Bayer for many years,” including “help[ing] Bayer with the marketing authorization of neonicotinoids.”
Follow the Moneyadded that WUR’s Bee Institute was “conducting research within the chemical company’s Bee Care program,” and that the university “does not want to disclose the exact financial ties between Bayer and the bee institute.”

Blacquière’s assessment was later cited on the Bayer website as evidence for the safety of neonicotinoids, and an interview with Blacquière was featured in Bayer’s annual magazine for its Bee Care program. According toFollow the Money,upon being asked about his role in the “PR for a pesticide giant,” Blacquièresaidthat WUR is “not a university” and that the organization “work[s] as a company for assignments.”70Vincent Harmsen. “Belangenverstrengeling zaait twijfels over giftig zaad,”Follow the Money, January 10, 2020.Archived December 17, 2022.

It suggested that land conversion was the most significant factor in the EU’s agriculture related emissions, and that precision agriculture could help to prevent the “expansion of farmland into untouched land” by improving land efficiency.88Yara submission, “Contributions – Biodiversity Survey”, European Commission, January – April 2021.

In February 2022, Yaraemailedthe European Commissioner for Agriculture, Janusz Wojciechowski, to request a meeting on “delivering on Farm to Fork objectives”. The company suggested that its innovations, including precision agriculture, could help the EU to achieve its targets for more sustainable farming, which include for example a 20% reduction in fertilizer use. It asked to discuss ways “to upscale precision farming”.89Email from Yara to Joanna Stawowy. “Delivering on the Farm to Fork objectives – Proposal for a meeting with Yara Europe,” European Commission on Agriculture and Rural Development, accessed via AsktheEU, March 14, 2022.Archived October 3, 2022.

In March 2022, Yararequesteda further meeting with DG AGRI regarding the Ukraine war. It sent a position paper on the topic, which argued, “Considering the growing risks related to worldwide food security, it is essential that farmers feed their crops with the nutrients necessary to reach their maximum genetic growth potential.” The paper claimed that synthetic fertilizers (also known as mineral fertilizers) “produce 50% of the food grown today”. It argued that, “The current uncertainty must not result in lower food production.”90Yara. “Position Paper – Ukraine invasion – addressing food, fertilizer &AdBlue® supply risks,” provided by European Commission Agriculture and Rural Development, accessed via AsktheEU, March 15, 2022.Archived October 3, 2022.

Scientists have challenged the idea that synthetic fertilizers support long-term food security.According tothe Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL), synthetic pesticides and fertilizers actually harm food security due to “deleterious effects on soil biota,” ultimately “degrading natural cycles” and ensuring that food systems are dependent on ever greater inputs of chemicals in order to maintain yields.91Dana Drugmand, Steven Feit, Lili Fuhr, and Carroll Muffett, “Fossils, Fertilizers, and False Solutions: How Laundering Fossil Fuels in Agrochemicals Puts the Climate and the Planet at Risk,” Centre for International Environmental Law, October 2022.Archived November 1, 2022.

Alternative growing systems can provide food security without agrochemicals,saysthink tank IPES-Food. “Data shows that [diversified agroecological] systems can compete with industrial agriculture in terms of total outputs, performing particularly strongly under environmental stress, and delivering production increases in the places where additional food is desperately needed.92“From Uniformity to Diversity – A paradigm shift from industrial agriculture to diversifed agroecological systems,”International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food systems, 2016.

Yara’s position paper gave a number of recommendations, including promoting “the efficiency of the nutrients used at farm level” through strategic plans for EU farming subsidies (known as CAP or the Common Agricultural Policy). The recommendation stated, that in order to maintain food production while meeting EU sustainability targets, “The best way forward is to support farmers with agronomic advice, precision farming and digital tools to make every nutrient count.”93Yara. “Position Paper – Ukraine invasion – addressing food, fertilizer &AdBlue® supply risks,” provided by European Commission Agriculture and Rural Development, accessed via AsktheEU, March 15, 2022.Archived October 3, 2022.

In an interview withPolitico’s Morning Agri newsletter in September 2021, Mónica Andrés Enríquez, executive vice president of Yara Europe, said: ​​“We don’t believe we are damaging the environment nor are we the most polluting company, in fact we are one of the least in Europe. If we compare to non-European producers, our GHG emissions are about 50 or 60 [percent] below the rest.”15“POLITICO Pro Morning Agri and Food: Flemish farm visit — Yara interview — Young farmers”,PoliticoEurope, September 3, 2021.

However, during a POLITICO Eventsponsoredby Yara, the company’s French President stated, “Food is gas. This is what everyone is discovering in the current situation [of gas shortages following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine]. We need gas because gas is hydrogen [a key component of fertilizers]. At Yara, we produce around 25% of European hydrogen through gas. So this gas is really needed because it’s the entry point of mineral fertilizers.” He also claimed that by choosing the “right form [of fertilizer] and by “using it properly”, farmers “can reduce nitrogen use by 20%, increasing revenues by 7%, and decreasing emissions by 20%.”16Nicolas Broutin. “Panel discussion – A recipe for food sovereignty,” POLITICO Future of Food and Farming Summit 2022, September 29, 2022.
In a 2019 YouTube video posted by Yara International about green ammonia, the companyclaimedthat about half of all food globally is produced using mineral fertilizers, and suggested that reducing fertilizer use would decrease available food for the increasing world population. The video also suggested that without using mineral fertilizers, the world could only feed 40 percent of its population.17“Yara Green Ammonia,” YouTube video uploaded by user “Yara International” on November 22, 2019.Archived 18 September 2021.

In Yara’s December 2020 Position Paper On Organic Farming, the company highlighted several environmentaldownsidesassociated with the use of organic farming, writing that although it is “often touted as the way forward,” “organic farming alone cannot feed the world population.” The paper states that the “most significant drawback” of organic farming is its “low productivity level” and increased land area requirement, arguing that these characteristics pose a “risk to the food system and the planet.”18“Position paper on Organic Farming,”Yara.Archived 18 September 2021. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/wip/dPZ8K
The paper also contends that the continued use of fertilizers would both promote food security in Europe and avoid an increase in land use for agriculture, which Yara argues would be required to fill the gap in food production between organic and conventional agriculture.19“Position paper on Organic Farming,”Yara.Archived 18 September 2021.

The position paper alsoclaimsthat ​​mineral fertilizers can “contribute to the reduction of food waste” by ensuring crops receive the “right nutrients,” giving them a longer shelf-life.20“Position paper on Organic Farming,”Yara.Archived 18 September 2021. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/wip/dPZ8K",,"Since 2020, EU agricultural policy has centered around the Farm to Fork Strategy (F2F), the EU’s plan for transitioning to a more sustainable food system. Farm to Fork, which is part of the European Green Deal, includes 2030 targets to reduce the use and risk of chemical pesticides by 50 percent, reduce the use of fertilizers by 20 percent, and increase the amount of land under organic farming to 25 percent.
Yara states that it “backs the EU ambition of transforming the food system in Europe”. It argues that it can help farmers to achieve the fertilizer target by addressing what it calls, “inefficient farming practices, which lead to the excessive use of nutrients”, and widely promotes digital and precision farming to achieve Farm to Fork goals. However, it has also called for a “ a dedicated impact assessment” on Farm to Fork measures.
In response to Farm to Fork, Yarapublishedan undated document on its website titled “Making every nutrient count”. The document states, “Several studies have shown that different targets set in the F2F and Biodiversity strategies can have a major impact on farmers’ income, food production and food security globally. All studies have their strengths and limitations, and for instance don’t address positive effects of the improved environmental aspects. Nevertheless, they all point to the fact that fertilizers are a key piece of the puzzle to keep up with EU’s ambition to produce food in a more sustainable way.”21“Making Every Nutrient Count: Farm to Fork Implementation”, Yara.Archived December 20, 2022.

In March 2022, the company sent a Position Paper on food security in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to decision-makers in the European Commission, which likewise stated, “All studies on the impacts of the different non-binding targets under the Farm to Fork (F2F) Strategy show that the biggest factor impeding farm productivity is the goal of halving nutrient losses by 2030.” It recommended precision farming, digital tools and agronomic advice in order to support farmers.22Yara. “Position Paper – Ukraine invasion – addressing food, fertilizer &AdBlue® supply risks”, provided by European Commission Agriculture and Rural Development, accessed via AsktheEU, March 15, 2022.Archived October 3, 2022.

As of November 2022, seven impact assessments by a number of universities, consultancies, and public institutions have been published.  Some suggest that the strategy’s targets could result in lower crop yields and lower income for farmers. However,according to reportingby Corporate Europe Observatory, five of the seven reports  have been paid for and conducted in collaboration with the agrochemical industry.23Nina Holland and Rachel Tansey. “A loud lobby for a silent spring: the pesticide industry’s toxic lobbying tactics against Farm to Fork,” Corporate Europe Observatory, December 2021.

Multiple NGOs and academics havecriticizedthe studies, arguing that they give only a “partial and incomplete” picture of F2F’s potential impacts.

Archive URL:https://archive.ph/nbSBW
Enríquez has said that the company did not believe it would be notably affected by the EU’s Farm to Fork strategy, because the company believes that “that estimated 20 [percent] of reduction of fertilizers will apply to those that are more polluting the environment.” This is a reference to companies that are more reliant on urea-based fertilizers, whichreleaseammonia into the atmosphere more readily than nitrogen fertilizers.41“POLITICO Pro Morning Agri and Food: Flemish farm visit — Yara interview — Young farmers,”Politico Europe, September 3, 2021.
