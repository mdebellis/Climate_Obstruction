Greenpeace v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry,,[2007] EWHC 311,Application granted,"Suits against governments, Environmental assessment and permitting, Other projects","United Kingdom, England and Wales, High Court of Justice","International Law, Aarhus Convention on Access to Environmental Information","The Judgment relates to a 12-month consultation process announced in November 2005 by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry regarding the Government’s review of its policy with respect to nuclear power stations. Greenpeace was among the parties that made submissions during the consultation. Despite many submissions against nuclear energy, the Secretary of State published a report in July 2006 announcing that the Government was favorable to the construction of new nuclear plants in the country. Greenpeace challenged that decision arguing that the consultation process had been flawed. Agreeing with Greenpeace’s allegations, the High Court declared the consultation process to have been “very seriously flawed” (para. 116). Notably, the Court reminded the Secretary of State that the Government had signed and ratified the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters and was thus bound by international law to provide full public consultation. Among other shortfalls, the Court highlighted that insufficient information was given to consultees, that the consultation document was seriously misleading, and that the consultation period was insufficient. Nevertheless, the Court held that the better outcome in the case was to grant declaratory relief, rather than a quashing order as asked by Greenpeace.",Challenge to consultation process for government report into construction of new nuclear power plants,,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/greenpeace-v-secretary-of-state-for-trade-and-industry

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but challenging different carbon credit projects. The REDD+ 2252 project, which is the subject of the lawsuit, overlaps the areas of 5 State Agro-Extractivist Settlement Projects (PEAEX). These PEAEX are public lands, whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 2252 generates REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and increased forest carbon stocks), was certified by an international company and has been established since 2016 to generate carbon credits for thirty years. Companies and individuals are sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of rural properties where it is located. The DPE-PA alleges irregularities in the property registrations that make up the project, and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. In addition, the mayor of Portel issued a Public Utility Decree authorising its operation, which the DPE-PA argues is unconstitutional. It is emphasised that the project was implemented without a prior technical study. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, that they did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and the concession of public forests and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. It argues that the defendants' behaviour entails the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) the recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) the suspension of Project 2252 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 2252 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel.",Whether there were established illegal carbon credit projects in extractivist lands areas in the Pará State.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230720_Public-Civil-Action-ACP-0806505-59.2023.8.14.0015-_petition-1.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/public-defenders-office-of-the-state-of-para-vs-brazil-agfor-llc-and-others-project-2252-carbon-credits-and-forest-carbon-grabbing

Review Application Against Decision to Grant an Environmental Authorisation to Conduct Exploratory Drillings,2024,,Pending,"Suits against governments, Human Rights, Right to a healthy environment","South Africa, High Court","South Africa, Constitution, South Africa, National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998","In South Africa, the GREEN CONNECTION NPC and NATURAL JUSTICE (herein the applicants), initiated a review application against the decision of the Director General of the Department of Minerals and Energy (the DG) and the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries (the Minister) granting an environmental authorisation to conduct exploratory drillings off the South-West coast of South Africa. The application is based on the ground that the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) utilized by the DG and Minister to inform their decision did not adhere to the stipulated requirements outlined in the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 (NEMA) and the Integrated Coastal Management Act 24 of 2001 (ICMA).
The issue is whether the decision to grant environmental authorisation to conduct exploratory drilling off the South-West coast should be set aside in that it was taken without proper assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposed project. In praying for the authorisation to be set aside, it is the contention of the applicants that the decision to grant environmental authorization was made without a thorough assessment of the environmental ramifications of the proposed project, as the EIR fails to meet the standards set forth by NEMA and ICMA. The EIR failed to consider climate change impacts associated with the use of any oil or gas discovered by the Proposed Project and to evaluate potential trans-boundary impacts of an oil spill resulting from a well blowout, particularly concerning contamination in Namibian waters and international waters. It does not adequately assess the extent of socio-economic impacts, including potential revenue losses for fishing operations and coastal communities in the area. The authorisation itself flouts section 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa which guarantees the right to a healthy environment, protected for present and future generations. It infringes on the environmental impact assessment principles in National Environmental Management Act (NEMA) enacted to give effect to the constitutional rights related to environmental protection. Consequently, the decisions made regarding the environmental authorization for the proposed project are legally flawed and subject to review and potential reversal under the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act (PAJA).
In relation to jurisdiction, GREEN CONNECTION NPC and NATURAL JUSTICE   assert that the requirements for loca standi and jurisdiction have been satisfied, in that the application is brought in their own interest, in the public interest in terms of section 38(1)(c) of the Constitution and section 32(1)(d) of NEMA and in the interest of protecting the environment in terms of section 32(1)(e) of NEMA, and that the adverse effects of the decisions under review will be experienced in the Western Cape. Hence, the Court has jurisdiction in terms of section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 (PAJA).",Whether the decision to grant environmental authorisation to conduct exploratory drilling off the South-West coast should be set aside in that it was taken without proper assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposed project,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2024/20240320_67124_application.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/review-application-against-decision-to-grant-an-environmental-authorisation-to-conduct-exploratory-drillings

According to the Turkish regulation of EIA, an EIA is required for some oil projects and expert examination is needed to determine whether an EIA is required. The exploration and drilling project (Permit No: ""AR/TPO/K/L42-c1,c3,c4) of TPAO (Turkish Petroleum)in Diyarbakir, Cermik, Petekkaya Village 154 block 18 plot, which is in question, belongs to the second group. The Diyarbakır Governorship issued a decision that EIA is not required for the project. The claimants argue that the decision of “EIA not required” was unlawful. The claimants refer to several grounds to support their argument.  First, they refer to the seismic tests. When searching for oil, a series of explosions are used to understand what is underground. This is called a seismic test. The claimants argue that seismic testing destroys wildlife and soil. Second, when searching for oil, taking into account that the substances used in drilling wells are toxic and that the debris carried to the surface during drilling contains radioactive minerals and heavy metals, agricultural areas underground and surface waters will be in danger. In addition, toxic liquids coming out of the ground because of the exploration activity will mix with the air, soil, underground water and other water resources. Heavy metals in the fluids brought to the surface will also negatively affect agricultural and animal husbandry activities. Consequently, human health will also be seriously negatively affected.

Public Prosecutor’s Office of the State of Rio de Janeiro vs. Municipality of Niterói (Neighborhood Impact Study),2013,ACP 0006155-57.2013.8.19.0002,Pending,"Suits against governments, Environmental assessment and permitting, Other projects","Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro State Court, Brazil, Superior Court of Justice","Brazil, Federal Constitution, art. 225, Brazil, Federal Constitution, art. 5, Brazil, Paris Agreement (enacted by Decree 9073/2017), Brazil, National Policy on Climate Change – PNMC (Federal Law 12, Brazil, City Statute (Federal Law 10.257/2001)","This is a Public Civil Action (ACP) filed by the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Rio de Janeiro (MPRJ) against the Municipality of Niterói, with the aim of requiring the defendant to carry out a Neighborhood Impact Study (EIV) before granting a license for the construction of large residential and commercial buildings, with more than six floors, in the Icaraí neighborhood of Niterói. The plaintiff argues that the neighborhood's urban infrastructure does not support greater population density, and that real estate expansion has harmed the local population's quality of life. It argues that new building licenses are being granted without the requirement of a prior urban planning study, in disagreement with municipal urban policies, especially the Master Plan (Municipal Law 1.157, updated by Municipal Law 2.123) and the City Statute (Federal Law 10.257/01). It states that the expansion of the real estate market must take place in accordance with municipal planning, preserving urban sustainability and environmental protection. In this sense, in anticipation of a preliminary injunction, it requests that the defendant be ordered to first obtain an EIV for all large-scale real estate developments in the Icaraí neighborhood, as a condition for a construction permit. On the merits, among the requests, it asks for confirmation of the injunction and for the defendant to be ordered to pay compensation for the moral and material damage suffered by the community as a result of the omission of the EIV.
In a preliminary injunction, the court found that there was a risk of irreparable damage or damage that would be difficult to repair. He ordered the defendant to proceed with the licensing of the projects in question with the prior approval of the EIV, under penalty of a fine.
In its statement of defense, the Municipality of Niterói argued, preliminarily, that the plaintiff had no interest in acting. It alleged that the claim of the present ACP is absorbed in the object of a previous ACP (2009.002.051167-6). It argued also that it is impossible to control the constitutionality of a municipal law by means of an ACP. It is also stated that the plaintiff's allegations are generic, and that the EIV for the aforementioned projects does not fall within the parameters set by the Municipal Legislature that require this assessment. It argued that the municipality was not liable for moral and material damages. It emphasized the lack of technical evidence capable of proving the plaintiff's allegations. He asked for the injunction to be revoked. It requested, among other things, (i) that the lawsuit be dismissed, due to the lack of interest in acting, the inappropriateness of the chosen course of action and lis pendens, and (iv) that the plaintiff's claim be dismissed.
In its ruling, the judge held that the City Statute introduced various instruments that allow the state to take preventive measures in order to avoid unbalanced urban growth and guarantee minimum conditions for the occupation of habitable spaces, such as the EIV. It stated that it was an instrument for implementing the principles of prevention, precaution and sustainable development. It also considered that the criterion used by the MPRJ to require the EIV is based on the law, which considers developments with more than six floors to be large, emphasizing that the right to quality of life necessarily requires a guarantee of an ecologically balanced environment, and that the City Statute, by outlining instruments to protect the environment, is linked to the collective system of diffuse rights. The claim for material and moral damages was dismissed. It granted the application in part, to confirm the preliminary injunction and order the defendant to obtain prior approval of the EIV for all large-scale, multi-family residential or commercial real estate developments, with more than six floors, in the Icaraí neighborhood, in the stretch corresponding to urban fractions IC-06, IC-07 (up to Pedra Itapuca), IC-08, IC-12 and IC-14, under penalty of a fine.
The Municipality of Niterói then filed an appeal. In ruling on the appeal, the Seventeenth Civil Chamber of the Rio de Janeiro State Court of Justice (TJRJ) emphasized that the right to an ecologically balanced environment (article 225 of the Federal Constitution) includes urban planning as an integrating factor and the right to sustainable cities, which is a fundamental right, related to the guiding principles of city development (article 182 of the Federal Constitution). It understood that the EIV seeks to contemplate the positive and negative impacts of developments in relation to the quality of life of the local and nearby population. It pointed out that the principle of adaptation, included in the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017) and provided for in the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009), requires reducing the vulnerability of natural and human systems, such as cities, to the effects of climate change. He considered that the action does not seek to declare a municipal law unconstitutional, but aims to comply with urban planning and environmental standards in order to oblige the municipality to require an EIV before approving large-scale developments, with a view to reducing urban risks and ensuring the sustainability of cities. He therefore dismissed the appeal.
The Municipality of Niterói then filed Special and Extraordinary Appeals, which were admitted by the Third Vice-Presidency of the TJRJ. The Special Appeal (REsp 1.923.322/RJ) was distributed to the Superior Court of Justice and is currently pending.
In addition, the Municipality of Niterói filed a Constitutional Complaint (Rcl 35.699/RJ) with the Federal Supreme Court (STF) alleging that the TJRJ's decision violated Binding Precedents 10 and 37. The Complaint was dismissed in a monocratic decision and, after an interlocutory appeal, in a ruling. The First Panel of the STF held that there had been no violation of the plenary clause, in accordance with Binding Precedent 10, because the basis of the decision did not concern the unconstitutionality of the municipal law. It also concluded that the discussion deals with the prior approval of the EIV for granting a license for the construction of large-scale projects, which is not related to Binding Precedent 37. The ruling became final and was removed to the archives.","Whether the Municipality of Niterói is required to carry out a Neighborhood Impact Study (EIV) before granting a license for the construction of large residential and commercial buildings, with more than six floors, in the Icaraí neighborhood of Niterói.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200401_ACP-0006155-57.2013.8.19.0002_judgment.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2019/20190510_ACP-0006155-57.2013.8.19.0002_ruling.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2016/20160401_ACP-0006155-57.2013.8.19.0002_decision.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2013/20130429_ACP-0006155-57.2013.8.19.0002_reply.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2013/20130201_ACP-0006155-57.2013.8.19.0002_order.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2013/20130101_ACP-0006155-57.2013.8.19.0002_petition.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/public-prosecutors-office-of-the-state-of-rio-de-janeiro-vs-municipality-of-niteroi-neighborhood-impact-study

Accordingly, the Tribunal dealt with the risk of loss of life with respect to bushfire risks by imposing conditions on the permit ensuring that the loss of life risks were reduced to a manageable level.

According to the Turkish EIA regulation, some oil projects should get an EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment), while experts should examine others to decide whether an EIA is required.

The claimants refer to several grounds to support their argument.  First, they refer to the seismic tests. When searching for oil, a seismic test is required, in which explosions are used to understand what is underground. The claimants argue that seismic testing destroys wildlife and soil. Second, the substances used in drilling wells when searching for oil are toxic, and the debris carried to the surface contains radioactive minerals and heavy metals. Agricultural areas, as well as underground and surface waters, will be in danger. In addition, toxic liquids coming out of the ground because of the exploration activity will mix with the air, soil, underground water, and other water resources.

While the claims made by landowners focused on the local impacts of the mine, such as potential water contamination and sound levels, Friends of the Earth argued that the lease and environmental authority should not be granted on the basis that the project will contribute to climate change and ocean acidification.  The proponent for the proposed mine, Xstrata Coal, argued that they were under no obligation to disclose the “Scope 3” emissions of a project during the environmental impact assessment process. Scope 3 emissions include indirect GHG emissions which occur at sites away from the mine, such emissions from transporting the coal and from its end-use in electricity production.  Friends of the Earth argued that these scope 3 emissions must be considered when assessing the potential environmental impact of the mine.  The Court held that it could only consider the environmental impacts of the mine itself, and not of other activities such as the transport of coal or its end-use.  In addition, it held that while the direct GHG emissions of the mine may contribute to climate change, that this should not outweigh all other considerations in the assessment process for the mine, such as the potential economic benefit to the State of Queensland.

The city council’s grounds for rejection included unacceptably high flooding risk, failure to consider various climate change impacts in accordance with state and national coastal and climate policy, and sustainable development principles as required by the local planning program—the Our Living City Settlement Strategy. The court noted that the plans for construction assumed a 100-year lifespan for the subdivision, but relied on several assumptions about how well existing dunes and other features of the location would withstand climate change, noting that the Council’s objections were not dependent on climate change, but rather a current risk that the protective dune and vegetation will be eroded.

Of the authorities cited by the court, the most important was Austria’s Climate Protection Act of 2011, which set emissions reduction targets for various sectors, including the transport sector. Because a third runway was expected to increase Austria’s annual CO2 emissions, the court concluded that it would be at odds with the provisions of the 2011 Act as well as with Austria’s constitution and its international commitments under EU law and the Paris Agreement.",Construction of third runway at Vienna's main airport,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20170202_W109-2000179-1291E_decision-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20170202_W109-2000179-1291E_decision-2.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20170629_W109-2000179-1291E_decision.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20170601_W109-2000179-1291E_decision.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/in-re-vienna-schwachat-airport-expansion

The inspector found that the appeal scheme should be approved because the significant benefits, including increased renewable energy and decreased greenhouse gas emissions, outweighed the limited harm to the character and appearance of the countryside. However, the Secretary disagreed, finding that the harm to the character and appearance of the area caused by the appeal scheme was greater than the permitted scheme such that it outweighed the benefits.  Lark Energy appealed the Secretary’s findings in the High Court of Justice alleging that the Secretary had failed to sufficiently consider local and national development policies.

The petitioner claims that the respondents were determined to take down fully grown trees rather than remove encroachments, stalls, electric polls, transformers, tankers and vehicle parking that is not planned, hawkers and squatters, and the encroachment of walking spaces. Additionally, the petitioner requested that the respondents provide guidelines for any road widening project that would require the subsequent felling of trees.
The petitioner’s stay application was dismissed by the Court, enabling the State to press forward with the road widening project. Nonetheless, the State was directed to abide by the conditions and directions set forth by the Court. The Court took into consideration the significance of sustainable development and striking a balance between development and environmental needs. Although it recognized the effects of tree-cutting, it concluded that the amount of forest cover in the area did not put the species of birds and insects at risk.

R(Goesa Ltd.) v Eastleigh Borough Council (expansion of Southampton Airport),2021,[2022] EWHC 1221 (Admin),Decided,"Suits against governments, Environmental assessment and permitting, Other projects","United Kingdom, England and Wales, High Court of Justice","United Kingdom, Town and County Planning (EIA) Regulations 2017, United Kingdom, Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (England and Wales)","In June 2021, Eastleigh Borough Council granted planning permission for the expansion of Southampton Airport, including through the extension of an existing runway. That decision was challenged on public law ground by GOESA Ltd, with “GOESA” standing for the Group Opposed to the Expansion of Southampton Airport.
Giving judgment in May 2022, the High Court dismissed the claim.
The council had not breached the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations. The focus of these regulations was to require the council to reach conclusions on the likely significant effects of the proposal on the environment. No criteria or thresholds had been set by which to measure the “significance” of the GHG emissions from a particular proposal. Nor was the court referred to any guidance for assessing the acceptability of that contribution, whether expressed as a percentage of national budgets or sectoral targets or otherwise.
The EIA Regulations focus on assessing the significance of an environmental effect. The legislation does not deal with the acceptability of an effect identified by environmental information. That is a matter of judgement for the decision-maker, not a hard-edged point of law. On the basis of current policy and law it was permissible for a planning authority to look at the scale of the GHG emissions relative to a national target and to reach a judgement, which may inevitably be of a generalised nature, about the likelihood of the proposal harming the achievement of that target. There was nothing unlawful about the inevitably broad judgement reached in the present case.
Further, the council did lawfully asses the cumulative effects of emissions from the expansion of Southampton Airport together with proposals for developing Bristol, Stansted and Leeds Bradford airports.

IBV challenged the refusal arguing that the exclusion of biomass from wood (1) was inconsistent with the Directive and (2) violated the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Constitutional Court of Belgium referred these issues to the EU Court of Justice. The Court of Justice found Walloon's interpretation of biomass was permissible under the Directive given its purpose.

R (Coal Action Network) v. Welsh Ministers and Coal Authority,2022,,pending,"Suits against governments, Environmental assessment and permitting, Natural resource extraction",,"United Kingdom, Coal Industry Act 1994, United Kingdom, Wales Act 2017","In 2020, private company Energybuild Ltd applied to the UK Coal Authority to deconditionalise the remaining conditional part of a coal mine licence, relating to a site in Aberpergwm, Wales. The purpose of the application was to expand mining operations. Emissions relating to the proposed expansion were estimated at approximately 100 million tonnes of CO2 from combustion of the coal and 1.17 million tonnes of methane gas, until the license expires in 2039.
In January 2022, the Coal Authority approved the application, resulting in a public law challenge by Coal Action Network, a group that aims to end coal use within the UK. The challenge was heard by the High Court in March 2023. In May 2023 the claim was dismissed.
The judge dismissed ground 1. Whilst Welsh Ministers now have the power to approve or decline authorisations for coal mining in Wales, that power was not applicable. The licence in question was granted before the power came into force, and there was a presumption against legislation having retrospective effect which was applied here.
The judge dismissed ground 2, which alleged the Coal Authority had interpreted its statutory powers too narrowly and, as a result, ignored relevant considerations concerning climate policy and climate impacts. The matters relied on by the claimant were not material to the Coal Authority’s task, which was to determine whether the conditions precedent in the conditional licenses had been fulfilled. The Coal Policy Statement, relied on by the claimant, only expresses what the Welsh Ministers’ intend to do, or not do, in future with respect to coal extraction. The statement was not relevant to the Coal Authority’s limited task of determining whether the conditions precedent were satisfied. Nor were the adverse climate change impacts, and the effect on the Welsh Ministers’ ability to meet their climate change targets, relevant to whether the conditions precedent were satisfied.
Coal Action Network appealed the ground 1 findings, relating to the powers of the Welsh Ministers. The grounds of appeal focussed on whether the legislation had retrospective effect, and on the scope of the mining company’s property rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court of Appeal held, however, that these matters did not arise. The legislation, properly interpreted, did not grant functions on the Welsh Ministers in relation to licences granted prior to the relevant devolution legislation, enacted in 2018. In reaching this conclusion the Court of Appeal saw no proper basis for inferring that the meaning of the devolution legislation was affected by the background against which it was enacted of increased national and international recognition of the importance of efforts to address climate change. There were no legitimate aids to statutory interpretation which indicated that the extent of the devolution powers conferred were to be judged by reference to the national or international context in this way (judgments paragraphs 27, 34 and 47).
It is not known whether Coal Action Network intend to apply to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal.","Whether the Coal Authority, when granting an application to deconditionalise a coal licence, had misunderstood its powers, and whether the Welsh Ministers had any powers, under devolution legislation, in respect of that application.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230316_19074_press-release.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220902_19074_press-release.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230817_19074_press-release-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230519_19074_judgment.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/can-coal-action-network-v-coal-authority-and-welsh-ministers

This petition was in reference the judgment of the Supreme Court dated 19th April, 2021 wherein the Supreme Court had ordered that a large part of the territory not be used for overhead transmission lines, gave instructions to convert to underground power lines within a year and appointed a committee to determine whether laying high voltage underground power lines would be feasible. The Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change, the Ministry of Power, and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (‘MNRE’) requested a modification of the judgement dated 19th April, 2021, on the grounds that the implementation of the said judgment would cause adverse implications for the power sector and India’s International commitment for energy transition and fulfilment of promise under the Paris agreement signed by India in 2015 under the United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate Change[UNFCC]. In the present case the Apex Court had to decide two major issues i.e. modification of the directions issued under the earlier judgment dated 19th April, 2019 and to balance the preservation of Great Indian Bustard and India’s commitment to control climate change through just transition [ shifting from energy from fossil fuels to renewable energy]. The Apex court reviewed the factors causing threats to Great Indian Bustards, the actions taken by the Government of India, specifically the programme ‘Habitat Improvement and Conservation breeding of Great Indian Bustard’ launched in 2016 and other measures. The Court also discussed the impacts of changing climate and India’s commitments and efforts to control it. It was observed that promotion of renewable energy sources is crucial for promoting social equity by ensuring access to clean and affordable energy for all segments of society and thus fostering inclusive growth and development across the nation. The Court emphasised on the duty on the part of the State under Article 48 A and fundamental duty of citizens under Article 51 A of the constitution of India as constitutional commitments to ensure protection of natural world and compassion for living creatures. Relating these duties to Articles 21 and 14 of the Indian Constitution, the Court declared that the right to clean environment and right against the adverse effects of climate change has its source in Article 21 which recognises the right to life and personal liberty and article 14 which indicates equality before law and equal protection of law. Thus, justifying the actions of the State, the court dealt with intersection between climate change and human rights as well as a novel issue of intricate interface between the conservation of an endangered species, such as the Great Indian Bustard and the imperative of protecting against the climate change.",Balancing the interplay between safeguarding biodiversity by preservation of the Great Indian Bustard and mitigating the impacts of climate change through interpretation of Indian Constitutional Provisions and other legal framework in India and international commitments.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2024/20240321_67806_judgment.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/mk-ranjitsinh-ors-v-union-of-india-ors

The author says that the municipality has been progressively incorporated into the Tapajós-Xingu Logistics Corridor, which includes commodity export corridors in the Madeira and Tocantins river basins and involves the implementation of various infrastructure projects with social and environmental risks. The lack of impact studies has caused serious environmental and social damage, such as deforestation, water pollution, loss of biodiversity, destruction of ecosystems and a threat to the livelihoods of traditional communities, including indigenous peoples, quilombolas, artisanal fishermen, riverine communities and extractive communities.

FARN v. Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development,2023,CAF 30593/2023,Pending,"Suits against governments, Environmental assessment and permitting, Natural resource extraction","Argentina, Administrative Court of Azul","Argentina, Law No. 27520/2019 (Minimum Budgets for Adaptation and Mitigation), Argentina, Law No. 25675, Argentina, Constitution","On August 1, 2023, Fundación Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (FARN) (an ENGO) filed a judicial claim asking for a precautionary order that prevents national authorities, including the Secretary of Climate Change, the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development and the Secretary of Energy, from providing consent for offshore seismic exploration and/or offshore fossil fuel exploitation until a proper environmental impact assessment and a strategic environmental assessment have been carried out, as the already conducted environmental impact assessment was described as deficient. According to the claim, these environmental assessments should include an assessment of activities’ cumulative and climate impacts, a consideration of energy alternatives and a cost-benefit analysis in the context of a just energy transition. Furthermore, FARN asked for the immediate halt of any already consented offshore exploration activity until the mentioned assessments had been conducted. This precautionary claim is an accessory to a future civil claim that FARN intends to file next with the aim to prevent environmental damages in the marine ecosystem and challenge the technical reasonableness of developing projects that are contrary to Argentina’s climate commitments.
Among the deficiencies observed in already conducted environmental assessments, the claim mentions an underestimation of projects’ GEI emissions, including methane emissions due to leakages in the exploration and production stage and emissions due to the combustion of the extracted fossil fuels. Allegedly, this deficiency prevented authorities from properly considering the cumulative impacts of GEI emissions on the climate.
Different legal grounds are alleged by FARN in the claim, including Article 41 of the Argentinean Constitution (right to a healthy environment), the duty to prevent environmental damage (Art. 2.g., Act 25.675), access to environmental information (Art. 16, Act 25.675), the duty to conduct environmental assessment (Art. 11 and 13, Act 25.675), the environmental principles (precaution, prevention, sustainability, intergenerational equity, non-regression), the Climate Change Act 27.520, the Paris Agreement, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Escazú Agreement and the American Convention on Human Rights (as interpreted by the Inter-American Court in its Advisory Opinion 23/17).
According to the claim, several transnational corporations are involved in the development of these activities together with YPF (the national energy corporation), including Equinor, Exxon Mobil, Qatar Petroleum Pluspetrol, Shell, Tullow, and Total Austral. This is not the first case challenging fossil fuel exploration and exploitation activities in the Argentinean Sea.
On September 14, 2023, the Federal Court rejected the precautionary order on the grounds that the case presents a high degree of technical complexity that cannot be addressed in an interim instance.
This decision was appealed by FARN on October 1, 2023, indicating that the court did not rule on the central aspect of the claim, which was to verify the cumulative impacts of the different offshore exploration and extraction projects according to the legal grounds alleged. FARN argued that the request did not require the determination of technically complex issues but the enforcement of compliance with the law in terms of environmental impacts.
This appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal on 22 November, 2023, on the same grounds: technically complex issues cannot be addressed in a precautionary claim. On December 5, 2023, FARN appealed this decision before the Supreme Court.",Whether a precautionary order can be ordered preventing seismic exploration/fossil fuel exploitation until proper environmental impact assessments can be conducted.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230801_CAF-305932023_petition-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230914_CAF-305932023_judgment-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231122_CAF-305932023_judgment-1.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/farn-v-ministry-of-the-environment-and-sustainable-development

Bord Na Móna Allen Peat Limited and others engaged in peat extraction and transport were also parties to the case.  At issue was whether the approval granted to Edenderry had complied with the EU’s Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which was incorporated into Irish law in 2010. An Taisce argued that the approval had not because it had considered only the impacts of the plant’s operations but not those resulting from the peat extraction and transport involved in supplying the bulk of the plant’s feedstock. Edenderry and the other respondents countered that because neither the peat nor plant operations were contingent upon one another they were unrelated for the purposes of environmental review. The High Court, noting that it was required to base its decision on the “actual reality of the project” at issue, rejected Edenderry’s arguments as theoretical—the permit application, after all, contemplated sourcing from these particular bogs, such that any other approach would constitute a material change to the application. Thus, “[t]here is functional interdependence as the power plant relies for the vast majority of its raw material on the designated bogs.” The court also noted that it made no difference that the bogs were independently subject to an air pollution licensing regime. The planning authority, it explained, “is entitled to take the licenses into account” when assessing the impacts of the peat extraction operations.",Appeal of planning authority grant of permission to operate power plant without first considering impacts of extracting feedstock,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2015/20151009_2015-IEHC-633_judgment.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/an-taisce-v-irish-planning-board

•	On Sep. 7, 2022, the UK government adopted its non-statutory Offshore Energy Plan (“the Plan”). This Plan was the subject of a strategic environmental assessment (“SEA”), known as “OESEA4”.
•	On Sep. 8, 2022, the government approved the design of its “Climate Compatibility Checkpoint” (“the Checkpoint”). The stated aim of this policy was to ensure that, before a new North Sea oil and gas licensing round is offered, “the compatibility of future licensing with the UK’s climate objectives is evaluated”. In approving the design of this policy, a proposed test was omitted. That test would have considered whether end-use emissions from the combustion of UK oil are expected to fall in line with the 1.5°C temperature target, if further licensing rounds are approved.
•	On Sep.16, 2022, the government decided that a further licensing round was compatible with the UK’s climate objectives. That was informed by departmental analysis by reference to the Checkpoint.
•	On Oct. 4, 2022, the Oil and Gas Authority (“OGA”) invited applications for offshore oil and gas licenses under section 3 of the Petroleum Act 1998, in what is known as the 33rd Offshore Oil and Gas Licensing Round. The OGA is a company wholly owned by the UK government which, since March 2022, has traded under the name “The North Sea Transition Authority”.
These decisions were challenged in public law claims issued in December 2022 by environmental charities Greenpeace and Uplift. In April 2023 both claims were granted permission to proceed to trial. In July 2023 they were heard. In October 2023 the High Court dismissed both claims, rejecting all the grounds of challenge:
•	The decision in OESEA4 not to assess end-use emissions from further oil and gas licensing rounds was rational. There was no breach of the relevant SEA regulations. Whilst the leading case of R(Finch) v Surrey County Council [2022] EWCA Civ 187 concerned environmental impact assessment, not SEA, the factual context and the two regimes were sufficiently analogous that important parts of the Finch analysis were applicable. Here the Plan only set the framework for licensing oil and gas exploration and production in the North Sea. It did not set the framework for downstream development such as refinement and storage. The end-use emissions from uses of the extracted oil and gas were not therefore “likely significant effects” of the Plan under the SEA regulations. Further, it was lawful for the government to conclude there was an insufficient causal connection between new oil and gas licensing and end-use emissions, and to decline to assess such emissions on that basis also. (Judgment, paragraphs 89 to 116.)
•	The government did not fail to properly to assess “reasonable alternatives” under the SEA regulations. That failure was said by the claimants to have resulted from a failure to properly assess the alternative of not proceeding with further licensing. However, to the extent this entailed arguments about market substitution, these did not arise given end-use emissions were not assessed. As to assessments of production emissions, these were matters of judgement. Nor was it unlawful for the government to have concluded that imports would have a higher emissions intensity than UK-produced hydrocarbons. (Judgment, paragraphs 117 to 136.)
•	The reasons for omitting the end-use emissions test from the Checkpoint were lawful and rational. It was also rational for the government to rely on the Checkpoint when adopting the Plan and deciding the new licensing round was compatible with the UK’s climate objectives. The Checkpoint is not a statutory plan or policy. It is an informative, non-binding document to assist ministers in deciding whether to support or not support a further licensing round. It was a matter of judgement for the Secretary of State as to whether he considered there to be an appropriate test or benchmark for taking scope 3 emissions into account on a decision whether or not to support a new licensing round. (Judgment, paragraphs 137 to 150.)
•	The failure to publish reasons for deciding a new licensing round would be compatible with the Checkpoint and the UK’s climate objectives was not unlawful. There was no common law duty to give reasons. (Judgment, paragraphs 151 to 158.)
•	Further grounds of challenge related to the OGA’s decision to carry out the 33rd licensing round necessarily failed, given the findings above (judgment, paragraphs 58 and 159).
It is not known whether the claimants intend to appeal to the Court of Appeal.","The lawfulness of a further licensing round for North Sea oil and gas, and of related policy, including in respect of whether end use emissions are direct effects for the purposes of strategic environmental assessment.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230425_19127_press-release.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230425_19127_na.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231019_19127_judgment.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/greenpeace-ltd-v-1-secretary-of-state-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy-and-2-the-oil-and-gas-authority-and-uplift-v-1-ssbeis-and-2-the-oga-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licensing

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but challenging different carbon credit projects. The Pacajaí project (Project 981), which is the subject of the lawsuit, overlaps with the areas of the Joana Peres II - Dorothy Stang and Joana Peres II - Rio Pacajá State Agro-Extractive Settlement Projects (PEAEX). These PEAEXs are public lands whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 981 generates REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and increased forest carbon stocks), has been certified by an international company and was established in 2008 to obtain carbon credits for forty years. Companies and individuals are sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of rural property. The DPE-PA claims that the land covered by Project 981 is illegal because it is located on public land within the perimeter of the settlements and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. It is emphasised that the project was implemented without a prior technical study. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and public forest concessions and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. It argues that the defendants' behaviour gives rise to the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) suspension of Project 981 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 981 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel.",Whether there were established illegal carbon credit projects in extractivist lands areas in the Pará State.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230725_Public-Civil-Action-ACP-0806631-12.2023.8.14.0015-_petition.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/public-defenders-office-of-the-state-of-para-vs-floyd-promocao-e-representacao-ltda-and-others-project-981-carbon-credits-and-forest-carbon-grabbing

While the project belongs to a private company, the regulations require an EIA procedure, and the procedure was conducted by the local governorship. According to the Turkish EIA regulation, an EIA is required for some oil projects and expert examination is needed for some projects to determine whether an EIA is required. The exploration and drilling project (Permit No: AR/PRT/K/M45-C) of Çalık Petroleum Exploration and Production Company in Diyarbakir, Bismil, Harmanli Village 112 block 2 plot, which is in question, belongs to the second group. The Diyarbakır Governorship issued a decision that EIA is not required for the project. The claimants argue that the decision of “EIA not required” was unlawful. The claimants refer to several grounds to support their argument.  First, they refer to the seismic tests. When searching for oil, a series of explosions are often used to understand what is underground. This is called a seismic test. The claimants argue that seismic testing destroys wildlife and soil. Second, when searching for oil, taking into account that the substances used in drilling wells are toxic and that the debris carried to the surface during drilling contains radioactive minerals and heavy metals, agricultural areas, underground and surface waters will be in danger. In addition, toxic liquids coming out of the ground because of the exploration activity will mix with the air, soil, underground water and other water resources. Heavy metals in the fluids brought to the surface will also negatively affect agricultural and animal husbandry activities. Consequently, human health will also be negatively affected. The claimants argue that the “EIA not required” decision by the Diyarbakır Governorship, contradict the opinion of expert institutions that there might be a threat to agricultural production and that an EIA process should be carried out. There are water wells and agricultural areas under and around the oil field. Again, in the institution's opinions, due to the water wells around, great care should be taken, and all necessary examinations should be carried out.","Whether the decision of “EIA not required"" for oil exploration and drilling is unlawful and should be annulled.",No case documents are available.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/diyarbakir-bar-association-ecology-association-vs-diyarbakir-governorship-2

The plaintiff alleges that the project was implemented without prior, free and informed consultation with indigenous and traditional communities, in violation of ILO Convention 169. Also, carbon credit projects, especially in the REDD+ modality, have structural flaws that compromise their effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, serving more as an instrument for the commodification of traditionally occupied territories than as a real climate mitigation mechanism. As a preliminary injunction, it is requested that urgent relief be granted for the immediate suspension of SEMA/AM's administrative acts. On the merits, it calls for the project to be declared null and void and for the state of Amazonas to be ordered to compensate the affected communities for material and moral damage.","Whether the carbon credits from a REDD+ project should be suspended for failing to conduct prior, free, and informed consultation with indigenous and traditional communities",No case documents are available.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/federal-public-prosecutors-office-v-state-of-amazonas-and-funai-carbon-credits-and-violation-of-prior-consultation

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but challenging different carbon credit projects. The RMDLT Portel-Pará REDD Project or Rio Mandaquari REDD+ Project (Project 977), which is the object of the lawsuit, overlaps areas of the State Agro-Extractivist Settlement Projects (PEAEX) Deus é Fiel and Joana Peres II - Dorothy Stang. These PEAEXs are public lands whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 977 generates REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and increased forest carbon stocks), was certified by an international company and was established in 2009 to generate carbon credits for forty years. Companies and individuals are sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of the rural properties where it is located. The DPE-PA alleges irregularities in the property registrations that make up the enterprise, and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. In addition, the mayor of Portel issued a Public Utility Decree authorising its operation, which the DPE-PA argues is unconstitutional. It is emphasised that the project was implemented without a prior technical study. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, that they did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and public forest concessions and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. The plaintiff argues that the defendants' behaviour entails the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) suspension of Project 997 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 977 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel.",Whether there were established illegal carbon credit projects in extractivist lands areas in the Pará State.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230724_Public-Civil-Action-ACP-0806582-68.2023.8.14.0015-_petition.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/public-defenders-office-of-the-state-of-para-vs-rmdlt-property-group-and-others-project-997-carbon-credits-and-forest-carbon-grabbing

Notably, the project would operate until about 2060. The court, after observing that the statute does not expressly contemplate climate change, held that such considerations are relevant and that their absence from the environmental review of the project made its approval unlawful. This question came before the court as a result of EarthLife Africa Johannesburg's appeals. The first appeal was submitted to the Minister of Environmental Affairs to challenge the adequacy of the project's environmental review; EarthLife argued that the review was invalid because it largely ignored climate change. The second was submitted to the High Court in Pretoria to challenge the Minister's mealy-mouthed determination that the review was legally valid even though it would have to be supplemented by a climate change analysis because issues related to climate mitigation and adaptation had not ""comprehensively assessed and/or considered.""",Challenge to environmental review of coal-fired power plant development for failure to adequately consider climate change-related impacts,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20170306_Case-no.-6566216_judgment-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180130_Case-no.-6566216_na.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180326_Case-no.-6566216_application.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20201119_Case-no.-6566216_order.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/4463

"Protect Dunsfold Ltd v Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities; Waverley Borough Council v SSLUHC",2022,,Decided,"Suits against governments, Environmental assessment and permitting, Natural resource extraction","United Kingdom, England and Wales, High Court of Justice","United Kingdom, Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (England and Wales)","In June 2022, the UK government granted an exploratory planning permission for UK Oil & Gas to explore for oil and gas near the village of Dunsfold in Surrey, close to an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). This came after Surrey County Council had refused the scheme, with the government thereby overturning the Council’s decision. The claimants are now challenging the government’s decision to grant the planning permission. In July 2023, the High Court dismissed the challenge.
The claimants argued that:
-	the Secretary of State had not complied with national policy requiring him to give “great weight” to conserving and enhancing landscape and scenic beauty as the starting point in his decision (ground 1);
-	the Secretary of State failed to explain a key inconsistency in his decision-making, which makes it unlawful. Namely, the same day the Secretary of State allowed the project at Dunsfold, he refused permission for a similar scheme because of its potential impact on the climate due to greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions from the proposal at Dunsfold would be higher than the other scheme (ground 2).
The judge dismissed both grounds. She found:
-	on ground 1: That the Secretary of State had reached an adequate interpretation of the policies when considering exploratory planning in an area of AONB.
-	on ground 2: The ‘similar scheme’ at Ellesmere Port was refused for distinct reasons, specifically that of climate change whereas at Dunsfold this was not the sole reason for refusal, meaning there is not an issue of inconsistency between the decisions.

The consent was granted via the A57 Link Roads Development Consent Order 2022.
When making this Order the Transport Secretary accepted the scheme would “result in an increase in carbon emissions” but concluded that the “proposed development is consistent with existing and emerging policy requirements to achieve the UK’s trajectory towards net zero”.
The challenge alleges the Transport Secretary failed to consider the environmental impacts of the scheme, including cumulative carbon emissions.
At the hearing in October 2023, all parties accepted that the above ground was materially the same as the challenge advanced by Dr Boswell in Boswell v Secretary of State for Transport [2023] EWHC 1710 which was dismissed by the High Court. However Dr Boswell had been granted permission to appeal by the Court of Appeal. The parties were in agreement with the court's suggestion that this ground of the present claim be stayed pending a decision from the Court of Appeal in Boswell. Accordingly, no submissions were made on the substance of this at the hearing. In November 2023 a judgment was issued, which recorded the above approach at paragraph 7.

"PUSH Sweden, Nature and Youth Sweden and Others v. Government of Sweden",2016,,Decided,"Suits against governments, Environmental assessment and permitting, Natural resource extraction, Suits against governments, Environmental assessment and permitting, Utilities","Sweden, Stockholm District Court","Sweden, Constitution","Vattenfall, an energy firm in which the Swedish government owns a controlling stake, agreed to sell several coal-fired power plants and associated mining assets to the German subsidiary of a Czech holding company. The sale was prompted in part by an environmental review that recommended Swedish divestment from fossil assets. Environmental NGOs and individual plaintiffs challenged the sale as a violation of the Swedish government’s duty of care to its citizens to protect their right to a non-harmful climate. The plaintiffs’ petition grounds this duty in the Swedish Constitution and Sweden’s adoption of several international agreements—the petition thus resembles submission made in the recent Urgenda decision in the Netherlands. The petition argued that the sale would enable the expanded exploitation of lignite coal assets, resulting in emissions in excess of limits that correspond to climate stability. It further noted that Sweden committed to act to avoid breaching those limits. On this basis, the plaintiffs asked the court to declare that 1) the Swedish state has breached its duty of care with the sale, and 2) the sale is illegal. The plaintiffs have also asked the court to order publication of the environmental review conducted in advance of the sale, which the government has so far withheld.",State-owned firm’s sale of coal and coal-burning assets to subsidiary of Czech holding company,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2016/20160915_3649_summons.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/push-sweden-nature-youth-sweden-et-al-v-government-of-sweden

Fridays for Future Estonia v. Eesti Energia,2020,,Decided,"Suits against governments, Environmental assessment and permitting, Utilities","Estonia, Tartu Administrative Court","International Law, UNFCCC, Paris Agreement","In May 2020, the Tartu Administrative Court allowed a complaint by Fridays for Future Estonia (officially MTÜ Loodusvõlu), an organization of young Estonian climate activists, seeking to nullify a permit issued to the state-owned energy group Eesti Energia for the construction of a new shale oil plant. Shale oil is a fossil fuel produced from oil shale (a coal-like fossil fuel found in Estonia) and exported outside the EU to be used as fuel on long-range ships.
Fridays for Future alleged that the municipality of Narva-Jõesuu issued the construction permit without adequately assessing its climate impacts and the commitments made under the Paris Agreement, as well as the European Union's objective to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. The court named two Eesti Energia subsidiaries as third parties, and the Ministry of the Environment (now Ministry of Climate) as an administrative body.
The courts of first and second instance did not uphold Fridays for Future’s complaint, stating that the construction permit does not cover carbon emissions from the use of the oil produced in the plant, but only the impacts of the construction activity itself. The circuit court also stated that a construction permit does not regulate the use of the building in the future, but only the process of construction and the impacts that it causes.
They also denied two requests for preliminary injunction to halt construction of the plant as not currently justified because the plaintiff's claims relate to impacts that would occur during the plant's operation, rather than construction. However, the Tartu Circuit Court granted a preliminary injunction in May 2021 and temporarily suspended the construction permit after it appeared that the impacts of the construction to the nearby Natura 2000 area had not been thoroughly assessed. Around two months later the injunction was lifted and the construction continued.
In 2022, the Supreme Court of Estonia accepted the complaint but denied a request for preliminary injunction.
On October 11, 2023, the Supreme Court upheld the claim and nullified the construction permit. Although the case was mostly built on climate arguments, especially on the shortcomings of climate impact assessment, and most of the Supreme Court’s judgement focuses on climate change matters, the court eventually did not nullify the construction permit on climate change grounds, but because there were other deficiencies with the environmental impact assessment, such as the failure to evaluate the impact on another Natura 2000 area and to evaluate climate sensitivity (or resilience) of the installation.
For the first time in Estonia, the Supreme Court stated that the mitigation of climate change is a constitutional obligation. More precisely, that the Estonian constitution requires a proportionate contribution to the Paris climate agreement goal to keep the global average temperature increase significantly below two degrees, preferably within 1.5 degrees of pre-industrial levels.
The court stated that the emissions of the plant should be compared to Estonian national climate targets to assess whether the plant’s climate impact is unacceptably large. Therefore, Scope 3 emissions that are emitted outside the borders of Estonia do not need to be accounted for. The court also explained that the oil plant operator's participation in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) may not be sufficient to meet Estonia's national climate targets and additional national targets may be necessary.
In 2020, when the permit was issued, Estonia had very relaxed climate targets. The court considered it justified to base the climate impact assessment on these and did not agree that the authority should have taken into account the EU climate neutrality target, because despite the government agreeing to it, at the time it was not legally binding. The Supreme Court found that the construction of the plant does not obviously prevent Estonia from fulfilling these relaxed targets, therefore the climate impact was not the reason to nullify the permit. However, the court explicitly noted that when the integrated environmental permit is issued in the near future, the related impact assessment must be based on the recently updated stricter climate targets.
The court made it clear that the authority must deny a permit to a project with a significant climate impact unless there is an overriding ‘existential state interest’ that would outweigh it. Otherwise it will unduly restrict the freedoms of individuals or the public interest in the future to curb climate change. The greater the risk of missing the climate targets, the greater must be the overriding interest. The court implied that if the risk of meeting the climate targets cannot be clearly excluded, the authority should not grant a permit to this project, because in the view of the court, in the case in question no such ‘existential state interest’ can be detected at present.
The court ordered the municipality of Narva-Jõesuu to assess the environmental impacts that had not been properly assessed before and decide again whether to grant a new construction permit.",Environmental group challenged issuance of construction permit for an oil plant.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220825_11477_decision.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231011_11477_decision.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/11477

By refusing to review the Queensland Supreme Court’s decision in Coast and Country Association of Queensland Inc v. Smith, the High Court of Australia effectively resolved a question about this review process, namely how to interpret the emissions of coal burned by the end-user of Australian coal. Environmentalists have long argued that even though coal emissions are remote from the mine, they should be considered in EIAs because they are a foreseeable result of mining and would not necessarily occur if the coal were not dug out of an Australian mine. The opposing view holds that coal combustion is physically remote from mining operations, that demand rather than supply drives the market for coal (meaning that mining more Australian coal does not necessarily cause more emissions globally), and that the Environmental Protection Act therefore does not require consideration of coal combustion emissions in EIAs for mines.

The lawsuit seeks to order the defendants to adopt effective measures to comply with the guidelines, deadlines and targets set out in federal and Rio Grande do Sul 's climate laws. It is argued that in the period from 2009 to 2023, the Federal Government, and from 2010 to 2023, the state of Rio Grande do Sul, by action or omission, failed to comply with the legal guidelines and did not meet the deadlines and targets set out in the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC), the Paris Agreement and the Rio Grande do Sul ‘s Policy on Climate Change (PGMC), as there was no effective implementation of instruments such as the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), equal and transparent composition of the Rio Grande do Sul Climate Change Forum (FGMC) and the Brazilian Climate Change Forum and no measures have been taken to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from coal-fired power plants in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with a Just Energy Transition (TEJ) plan, which results in the ineffectiveness of these climate standards. It is pointed out that the climate crisis has led to water shortages in the municipality of Candiota, which has been recognized by municipal decree and that, in parallel to this situation, the various coal-fired thermoelectric plants in the region use local water for cooling, causing damage to the water system, the biome and the climate. It is alleged that the defendants have neglected climate policy when dealing with the licensing and renewal of licenses for these projects in the state. At the same time, the Federal Government has encouraged coal-fired thermoelectric projects through energy auctions authorized by ANEEL. CRM, responsible for the Candiota coal mine, and CGT Eletrosul, responsible for the Candiota III Thermoelectric Plant - the most polluting and least efficient plant in the country - have been operating in disregard of environmental climate laws. It is argued that it is up to the Judiciary, based on the principle of the prohibition of regression and duties of protection, to guarantee effective compliance with the rules in question and prevent the climate scenario from worsening. It is argued that the entire situation of alleged unlawfulness gives rise to a claim for compensation for collective moral damages. The plaintiffs make several requests for injunctive relief for the various defendants, so that the defendants' conduct is brought into line with the environmental climate standards. On the merits, it is requested that (i) the requests for preliminary injunctions be confirmed; (ii) it be declared that in the period from 2009 to 2023, the Federal Government, and from 2010 to 2023, the state of Rio Grande do Sul, by action or omission, failed to comply with climate standards and did not meet the deadlines and targets set out in the PNMC, the Paris Agreement and the PGMC, because they did not give effect to the regulations and did not act to reduce GHG emissions from coal-fired thermoelectric plants in the state; (iii) to declare that Rio Grande do Sul has failed to meet the targets and deadlines set out in international, national and state regulations; (iv) the suspension of public incentives to exploit coal in the state, the implementation of a TEJ plan for the contested plants; the publication of public notices to finance educational projects and research projects with universities and federal institutes that encourage environmental awareness and the guidelines of the PNMC and PGM; the creation of a WG for the decommissioning and energy transition of coal-fired projects; the suspension and non-renewal of energy sales contracts for the contested plants; (v) ordering the defendants to pay compensation for climate damage; (vi) ordering the Federal Government and the state of Rio Grande do Sul to bear the costs of the requests made; (vii) ordering all the defendants to pay the sum of ten million reais as collective moral damage in environmental and climate matters.","The lawsuit seeks to order the defendants to adopt effective measures to comply with the guidelines, deadlines and targets set out in federal and state (Rio Grande do Sul) climate laws.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230706_Public-Civil-Action-ACP-5050920-75.2023.4.04.7100_petition-1.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/instituto-preservar-agapan-and-nucleo-amigos-da-terra-vs-federal-union-and-others-climate-emergency-in-rio-grande-do-sul-state

The ACF appealed the decision dismissing the judicial review challenge. Adani proposed to develop and operate a coal mine and associated infrastructure in Central Queensland. The ACF alleged error by the Minister in failing to determine the impact of combustion emissions on the Great Barrier Reef under s 527E of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

The Act requires consideration of the proposal in connection with, among other things, its effects upon the environment. There is a prohibition upon the taking of action that has, will have, or is likely to have a significant impact on the environment. The ACF claimed that the Minister made an error of law in failing to consider the effect of emissions from transport by rail, shipping, and combustion of the product coal overseas, in characterising these emissions as “not a direct consequence of the proposed action,” and in failing to consider or apply the precautionary principle in relation to the possible impacts on relevant matters of national environmental significance.

All of the grounds were challenged by the Applicant in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The Tribunal decided state policy requiring the assessment and management of wider risks and consequences of the proposed development to the community meant the Applicant must prepare a coastal hazard vulnerability assessment even though Melbourne Water, the referral Authority, did not object to the permit. The Tribunal expressed concern that the subsequent assessment report did not address risks of inland or riverine flooding in addition to coastal flooding, however it refused the permit application on unrelated grounds.
The same parties again came before the Tribunal after Owen commissioned an assessment. The Tribunal found the assessment inadequate because it had considered only flooding related to coastal hazards and had ignored the risks attendant to riverine flooding, which was also expected to worsen with climate change.",Permission to develop in a floodplain,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2009/20090925_VCAT-1946-VCAT-522_decision-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2010/20100323_VCAT-1946-VCAT-522_decision-1.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/owen-v-casey-city-council-2

"R(Bristol Airport Action Network) v Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (expansion of Bristol Airport)",2022,,Decided,"Suits against governments, Environmental assessment and permitting, Other projects","United Kingdom, England and Wales, High Court of Justice","United Kingdom, Town and County Planning (EIA) Regulations 2017, United Kingdom, Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (England and Wales)","In February 2022, planning permission was granted for the expansion of Bristol Airport. The decision  permitted an extra 2 million passengers per year, an increase of 20%. The decision was made on behalf of the Secretary of State by a panel of planning inspectors, and  was challenged on public law grounds by a network of members of environmental organisations and of local residents.
In January 2023, the High Court gave judgment, dismissing the claim, including the five climate-related grounds that were advanced:
The panel did not err in its interpretation of local planning policies. It was entitled to conclude that these policies did not directly address aviation emissions. The panel’s reasoning was lawful. (Paragraphs 56 to 95.)
Nor did the panel err in its interpretation of national policy on ‘Making best use of existing runways’, and its reasoning for this interpretation was lawful. The panel considered whether the predicted aviation emissions would have a material impact on the government's ability to meet its climate change targets and budgets. This was appropriate given the judgment in R(Goesa Ltd) v Eastleigh Borough Council [2002] EWHC 1221. (Paragraphs 96 to 121.)
The panel did not err in its approach to paragraph 188 of the National Planning Policy Framework. Under that policy the focus of planning decisions should be on whether proposed development is an acceptable use of land, rather than on the control of emissions where these are subject to separate pollution control regimes. Paragraph 188 goes on to say that planning decisions should assume that these other regimes will operate effectively. When applying this policy the panel was entitled to treat the Climate Change Act 2008 as a ""separate pollution control regime”. (Paragraphs 122 to 152.)
The panel was entitled to give no weight to evidence that the increased emissions would consume a local carbon budget for the council area. It reached this conclusion on the ground that such budgets have no basis either in law or in policy. That was rational and lawful. (Paragraph 153 to 176.)
Nor did the panel’s approach to the impact of non-CO2 emissions from aircraft breach the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations 2017. The panel was entitled, in the exercise of its planning judgement, to refuse to make use of an official multiplier of 1.9 designed to take account of non-CO2 effects. On this the Climate Change Committee’s attitude was plainly of high relevance, and the Committee’s view was that non-CO2 emissions should not be included within the UK’s net zero target. Further, the developer’s environmental statement was lawful. There currently exist scientific uncertainties in assessing non-CO2 effects. It was open to those preparing the environmental statement to decide, as they did, to leave non-CO2 emissions to be dealt with until when the science enables them to be brought into account for the purposes of the Climate Change Act. As was the case in R(Friends of the Earth Ltd) v Heathrow Airport Limited [2020] UKSC 52, there was no ""space"" in the present case for the operation of the precautionary principle. (Paragraphs 177 to 198.)
In May 2023, it was reported that the Court of Appeal had refused the claimant permission to appeal the High Court’s ruling, bringing the litgiation to an end.",Whether and to what extent aviation emissions should play a role in deciding whether planning permission should be granted for the expansion of an airport.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230131_22316_judgment.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230518_22316_na.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/rbristol-airport-action-network-v-secretary-of-state-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities-expansion-of-bristol-airport

The project is the largest open pit coal mine in Brazil, with a high potential for water pollution. The plaintiff points out flaws in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the project, neglecting to comply with important permitting phases, such as holding public hearings in affected communities. The plaintiff claims that the project poses a risk of pollution, especially to the Jacuí River, which contributes with 86.3% of the average flow of Lake Guaíba, which is responsible for supplying drinking water to several municipalities. It highlights the need to analyze the extent of possible environmental damage resulting from the undertaking and the synergies with other infrastructures designed for the region. It also argues that the Guaíba Mine Project will impact the balance of water resources, which is inextricably linked to climate change, and thus mobilizes the National Policy on Climate Change – PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009). Therefore, actions such as pollution of springs, diversion of water courses, lowering of water tables, drainage of aquifers, among other harmful measures related to the Project, are directly or indirectly related to climate change. It is required, among other points, (i) as a preliminary injunction, the suspension of the permitting process for the Guaíba Mina Project until the judgment on the merits, so that the installation of the mine is prohibited and (ii), on the merits, the prohibition of the installation of the project in the originally planned location, in view of the irreversible environmental damages that it will cause to the region, in addition to the declaration of nullity of the environmental licensing procedure with the initiation of a new procedure that contemplates all the risks and the elaboration of an action plan for emergency, with a view to mitigating the consequences of possible environmental damage.",Whether an open pit mine project impacts the balance of water resources and climate change.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200910_5049921-30.2020.4.04.7100-redistributed-as-5002559-45.2021.8.21.0001-in-the-Court-of-Justice-of-the-State-of-Rio-Grande-do-Sul_petition.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20201105_5049921-30.2020.4.04.7100-redistributed-as-5002559-45.2021.8.21.0001-in-the-Court-of-Justice-of-the-State-of-Rio-Grande-do-Sul_decision-1.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/arayara-association-of-education-and-culture-vs-copelmi-mineracao-ltda-and-fepam-guaiba-mine-project-and-hydrological-risks

In its decision, the Court distinguished between direct GHG emissions (Scope 1 GHG emissions) and indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2 GHG emissions), i.e. emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity. With respect to direct emissions, the Court held that it was lawful and reasonably implementable to take them into account in the approval process. The Court further highlighted that it was not discriminatory to do so as upcoming approvals would follow the same rule. However, the Court refused to impose any condition with respect to indirect emissions.

It calls for the cancellation of all licenses and authorizations issued by the state agency regarding the authorization for the controlled burning of sugar cane straw in the municipalities covered by the Campinas Judicial Subsection, as well as for the defendants to be prevented from issuing new licenses without the preparation of an Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Impact Report (EIA/RIMA). The aim is for IBAMA to act in a supplementary way to implement and supervise measures to protect the environment, since the state agencies responsible are not acting satisfactorily. The plaintiff alleges that this activity entails various damages, such as to the atmosphere - generating pollution and contributing to global warming - to public health, among others, in addition to the fact that the burning of sugarcane straw is a practice repudiated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - UNFCCC (promulgated by Decree 2.652/1998). Finally, the MPF requests that, in the event of an application for a license for this activity, an EIA/RIMA must be carried out as a condition for this, and the analysis must be comprehensive, taking into account, among other factors, the changes in the atmosphere related to the greenhouse effect and global warming.
In its defense, IBAMA claims, among other things, (i) that it is not a party to the lawsuit since it does not have the authority to carry out such licensing, (ii) that the technical criteria relating to the assessment of impacts are acts of technical discretion and (iii) that environmental licensing is unnecessary for the burning of sugarcane straw. The State of São Paulo, in its opposition, argues that the abrupt stoppage of the sugarcane harvesting system will cause damage to economic and social values that will outweigh the impacts on the environment and human health. It identifies the presence of federal and state legislation authorizing the controlled burning of sugarcane straw and that there is state competence to authorize this practice, without the need to prepare an EIA/RIMA. CETESB, in its defence, argues that authorizations for the controlled burning of sugarcane straw include measures to mitigate the negative impacts of the practice, and that the state agency is competent to issue such authorizations. It also argues that it is not necessary to prepare an EIA/RIMA in order to grant authorization for this activity and that the licensing of a sugar-alcohol enterprise covers all activities related to the end activity, such as the agricultural area planted. Finally, it states that the practice respects national and state climate change policies, since the aim is to mechanize sugarcane harvesting and gradually reduce the practice of burning.
A preliminary injunction was issued, in which part of the injunction was granted, determining, among other measures: (i) that CETESB and the State of São Paulo should not grant environmental licenses and permits for the burning of sugarcane straw without first carrying out an EIA/RIMA in the region referring to the Campinas Judicial Subsection; and (ii) that IBAMA should monitor the requirement for licensing and EIA/RIMA. The court found that it was unreasonable to immediately suspend all sugarcane straw burning activities and ordered that the measures be applied from the next harvest onwards.
Subsequently, the court handed down a sentence in which it ordered CETESB and the state of São Paulo to refrain from granting new licenses and authorizations that do not include specific licensing with EIA/RIMA and take into account the consequences of the activity for the atmosphere, global temperature and others; and IBAMA was ordered to supervise the damage caused by the burning of sugarcane straw.","The cancellation of all licenses and permits issued by the state agency regarding authorization for the controlled burning of sugarcane straw in the municipalities covered by the Campinas Judicial Subsection, as well as for the defendants to be prevented from issuing new licenses without the preparation of an Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Impact Report (EIA/RIMA).","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220305_ACP-5008327-46.2017.4.03.6105_ruling.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200313_ACP-5008327-46.2017.4.03.6105_ruling.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180417_ACP-5008327-46.2017.4.03.6105_order.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180301_ACP-5008327-46.2017.4.03.6105_reply.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180319_ACP-5008327-46.2017.4.03.6105_reply.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180326_ACP-5008327-46.2017.4.03.6105_reply.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20171218_ACP-5008327-46.2017.4.03.6105_petition.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/federal-public-prosecutors-office-vs-state-of-sao-paulo-cetesb-and-ibama-burning-of-sugarcane-straw

Among the legal authorities cited, perhaps most central to MFHR’s claims was Article 11 of the European Social Charter of 1961; that article protects citizens’ right to a clean environment by requiring, among other things, restrictions on pollutants known to compromise human health. MFHR’s allegations ranged from the government’s failure to prepare adequate environmental impact assessments, to its lax enforcement of pollution control measures, to its failure to achieve reductions in the emission of conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases, to its lack of labor protections. After considering the Greek government’s rebuttals, e.g., that it had begun tightening its environmental enforcement regime vis-à-vis the coal mines and power plants at issue, the Committee concluded that Greece had indeed violated several articles 2, 3, and 11 of the European Social Charter.","Greece's governance of coal miles and power plants with respect to those facilities impacts on the environment, human health, and occupational health and safety",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2007/20070607_Complaint-No.-302005_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/marangopoulos-foundation-human-rights-mfhr-v-greece

WWF v Norwegian Parliament (Seabed Mining Case),2024,,Pending,,"Norway, Oslo District Court","Norway, Norwegian Subsea Minerals Act, Norway, Environmental Impact Assessment","The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is challenging a Norwegian parliamentary decision to open up vast areas of the seabed for mining. The organization argues that the environmental impact assessment (EIA) on which the decision was based is inadequate. In April 2024, WWF notified the government of its intention to sue if the decision was not reversed. WWF maintains that the EIA does not meet the minimum requirements set out in the Norwegian Subsea Minerals Act §2-2. The organization also points out that the Norwegian Environment Directorate has expressed similar concerns. WWF further argues that the EIA shows that the Norwegian government does not have sufficient knowledge to assess the environmental impacts of seabed mining. Without this knowledge, it is impossible to properly assess the consequences of exploration and extraction activities. WWF's lawsuit aims to prevent the Norwegian government from violating the law by opening up a new and potentially destructive industry without adequately assessing the consequences. The organization believes that this would set a dangerous precedent and could lead to irreversible environmental damage. Several Norwegian political parties, including the Socialist Left Party, the Liberal Party, the Red Party, the Green Party, and the Christian People's Party, voted against the decision to open up the seabed for mining. These parties share WWF's concerns about the inadequacy of the EIA and the potential environmental risks of seabed mining.

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but questioning different carbon credit projects. The Ribeirinho REDD+ Project (Project 2620), which is the subject of the lawsuit, overlaps the areas of five State Agro-Extractivist Settlement Projects (PEAEX). These PEAEX are public lands, whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 2620 was presented to an international certifying company in 2017, but has not yet been registered, to generate REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and an increase in forest carbon stocks) for a period of thirty years. The companies and association are being sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of the rural properties where it is located. The DPE-PA alleges irregularities in the property registrations that make up the project, and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. In addition, the mayor of Portel issued a Public Utility Decree authorising its operation, which the DPE-PA argues is unconstitutional. It is emphasised that no prior technical study was carried out for the project. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and public forest concessions and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project.

The decision to grant planning permission was made in December 2022 by the Secretary of State (SoS) for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, on the recommendation of a planning inspector after a planning inquiry held in 2021. FoE challenged the decision as unlawful on the following grounds:
-	The SoS’ conclusion that the mine would be a “net-zero” mine for the purpose of reaching the UK’s Sixth Carbon Budget (covering the period of 2033-37, and as established under the UK’s Climate Change Act 2008) was unlawful. International carbon offset credits, which the mining company undertook to buy to offset the mine’s residual emissions, do not count towards the UK’s carbon budgets.
-	The SoS’ failed to lawfully address the international impact of this decision, despite the evidence given on this issue by highly qualified people, like the former chair of the IPCC.
-	The SoS erred in his approach to the extent to which the coal would “substitute” for other coal in the global market or be “additional” to it, resulting in the unlawful conclusion that there would be no net emissions increase because of the mine.
-	FoE also reserved the right to argue a point on the SoS’ approach to downstream emissions, depending on the UK Supreme Court’s decision in R (Finch) v Surrey County Council & ors,  which was heard in June 2023.
SLACC challenged the decision as unlawful on the following grounds:
-	The SoS failed to deal with the principal issue of whether or not there would be perfect substitution, which would determine the extent of the climate impact of the mine.
-	The SoS failed to deal with the principal issue of the international impact of granting planning consent.
-	The SoS incorrectly determined whether downstream emissions are indirect significant environmental effects of the mine.
-	The SoS applied a different threshold to the opposing parties’ evidence and arguments at the planning inquiry, and imposed the unlawful burden on the claimant of disproving the mine company’s case.",Whether the decision to grant planning permission for a new coking coal mine was unlawful.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230101_19078_complaint.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230408_19078_order.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230412_19078_press-release-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230116_19078_press-release-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230426_19078_na.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230518_19078_order.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230728_19078_order.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231017_19078_judgment.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2024/20240913_19078_judgment.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/friends-of-the-earth-v-secretary-of-state-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities-and-south-lakeland-action-on-climate-change-v-ssluhc-whitehaven-coalmine

The plaintiff alleges that the exploitation of minerals in the state is being affected by extreme atmospheric phenomena, a situation neglected by the federative entity. It is pointed out that the negligence regarding the climate issue resulted in the flooding of the Downstream Containment Structure (ECJ) dam built by Vale S/A in the Municipality of São Sebastião das Águas Claras after heavy rains, flooding roads in the region, leaving the district without access to water, electricity, transportation, garbage removal and other essential services. The author indicates that the project was not preceded by an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) or due environmental licensing. The plaintiff emphasizes that the company is unable to measure the impacts of a possible dam failure if the ECJ reservoir is overflowing with water and tailings. It is affirmed that it is therefore necessary to review the hydraulic modeling for this type of project through a corrective environmental licensing process. Still regarding Vale S/A, it is required the stoppage of the Apolo Project, since the studies presented in the scope of its environmental licensing processes would not have analyzed the influence of the intensification of extreme climatic events on the operation of the activity. The environmental licensing process for the Serra do Taquaril Mining Complex, managed by Mineração Taquaril S/A, is also to be halted, considering that the effects of climate change on the project have not been assessed. According to the EIA, due to the Complex, sediment containment basins will be built, which, if they break, will directly impact a water intake pipeline, affecting the supply of 70% of the local population. The plaintiff argues that the National Policy on Climate Change and the State Policy for Preventing and Combating Disasters Resulting from Heavy Rainfall should guide environmental licensing in the State of Minas Gerais, in order to include the climate variable in the procedure, following a decision issued by the 9th Federal Court of Porto Alegre, which determined the inclusion of climate guidelines in the Terms of Thermoelectric Power Plants in Rio Grande do Sul State. It is required that the environmental licensing of the Serra do Taquaril Complex and the Apolo Project must be suspended and the corrective licensing of the JTC must be immediately initiated.
In its reply, Vale S/A informed that the Apolo Project was at a preliminary stage, still under analysis by the competent environmental agency, so as not to represent danger to the environment. It informed that ECJ would already be going through a corrective licensing phase before the competent environmental agency, which is why there was no interest in acting by the plaintiff. It defended the existence of an impossible passive joinder of defendants, since there would be no relationship between the defendants or affinity between the requests made against each defendant. Subsequently, the plaintiff requested an amendment to the initial application, in order to exclude Vale S/A from the defendant's position. In August 2022, a partial judgment was rendered that extinguished the claim against Vale S/A. Afterwards, the court dismissed the action, without resolution of the merits, for inadequacy of the chosen path. It was understood that the Citizen Suit is not an appropriate procedural means for the demand sought.",Whether a permanent injunction can be filed under a Citizen Suit against mining projects due to the omission to analyze the worsening of extreme weather events within the environmental licensing process.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220207_APop-5020547-95.2022.8.13.0024_petition.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/duda-salabert-rosa-vs-minas-gerais-state-and-taquaril-mineracao-sa
