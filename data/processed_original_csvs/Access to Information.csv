The Tribunal evaluated arguments relating to each of 11 contested documents and ultimately concluded that the interest of the public weighed on both sides of the case: the public had an interest in knowing how the Victorian and federal governments had negotiated issues related to climate change policy; but the public also had an interest in the Victorian government’s staff being free to deliberate without concern that those deliberations should be public.

Environment Victoria Inc. v. Department of Primary Industries,2013,[2013] VCAT 39 (Australia),Application approved in part,"Suits against governments, Access to information","Australia, Victoria, Civil and Administrative Tribunal","Australia, Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Federal)","The applicant, an NGO, submitted a request  to the respondent under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (FOIA) for documents relating to: the possible allocation of new licenses to mine brown coal in the Latrobe Valley; reductions to the premium solar feed-in tariff paid to consumers who contribute electricity to the power grid from solar panels; and changes to the planning controls over wind farms. The Department failed to respond to the request within 45 days (as required by the Act). After proceedings were commenced, some documents were produced and issues in dispute were eventually narrowed to four particular documents.  Three of these documents related to allocation of licenses to mine coal, and the fourth related to the premium feed-in tariff scheme.  In withholding these documents, the Department relied on an exception to FOIA which protects cabinet documents (for the three coal related documents), and an exception which protects internal working documents (in relation to all four documents). The Tribunal held that, with the exception of an introductory portion of one document, that the three coal license related documents were protected by the exception for internal working documents, as they had been prepared in order to brief the Minister on issues “of the utmost importance to Victorians.”  The high level nature of the briefing documents, and the sensitivity of the issues involved, were considerations that weighed against their release under FOIA.

The plaintiffs question the adequacy of the administrative acts that structure the institutional design of the IncentivAuto Program - Automotive Regime for New Investments to the federal and state rules protecting the climate system, such as the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12. 187/2009) and the State Policy on Climate Change - PEMC (State Law 13.798/2009), and the international commitments made by Brazil, especially under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. The plaintiffs highlight the lack of transparency of the Program's information, which resulted in the separate filing of the Autonomous Action for the Advance Production of Evidence (No. 1047315-47.2020.8.26.0053). They argue that public policies for social and economic development should be aligned with the mitigation of environmental or climate damage and the preservation of the environment, life, and human health of present and future generations, highlighting the social function of property. They allege that the acts do not bring any requirement for project assessment through socio-environmental parameters that aim at the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. According to the plaintiffs, the Program finances, with public resources, the increase of emissions, in disagreement with the protective norms of the climate system. Finally, they request, among other things, (i) the granting of injunctive relief determining the suspension of the IncentivAuto Program and, definitively, (ii) the confirmation of the injunction to declare the nullity of the regulations that structure it and of the other administrative acts resulting therefrom; or, alternatively, to determine that the State of São Paulo includes, in the Program, conditions for the approval of projects related to the adoption of measures aimed at the reduction of GHG emissions and adaptation to climate impacts.","The adequacy of the regulations of the IncentivAuto Program (Automotive Regime for New Investments) to the international, federal, and state rules protecting the climate system.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231025_Acao-Popular-1068508-84.2021.8.26.0053_reply-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231025_Acao-Popular-1068508-84.2021.8.26.0053_reply-2.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231025_Acao-Popular-1068508-84.2021.8.26.0053_decision-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231025_Acao-Popular-1068508-84.2021.8.26.0053_decision-2.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/clara-leonel-ramos-and-bruno-de-almeida-de-lima-vs-state-of-sao-paulo-families-for-the-climate-and-incentivauto-program

The plaintiffs reason that these documents could support or prevent the filing of a class action lawsuit. The program provides financing to motor vehicle manufacturers to carry out projects to expand their industrial plants, set up new factories or develop new products. The plaintiffs allege that it is potentially illegal for IncentivAuto to finance projects that do not minimize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in disagreement with the State Policy on Climate Change - PEMC (State Law 13.798/2009) and the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009). In addition, they argue that the use of resources from the São Paulo State Taxpayers Support Fund (FUNAC) to finance projects that stimulate polluting action is potentially damaging to the treasury and the environment, without taking into account the need to make socio-economic development compatible with protecting the climate system. The applicants stress the vulnerability of children and adolescents to air pollution and the impacts of climate change. They therefore request the production of documentary evidence relating to projects submitted to IncentivAuto.
On November 16, 2020, the State of São Paulo offered a reply alleging (i) illegitimacy of the applicants to defend diffuse and unavailable interests of third parties, (ii) disconnection of the right that is intended to protect with the objective facts to be proved with the documents and (iii) existence of confidentiality that justifies the limitation of access to information.
