The subproperties allow the ontologist to do three things:
1) Distinguish start and end times.
2) Indicate whether a time is planned or actual. This is useful for everything from project management to calendar appointments and the like. It is also useful for date effectivities; i.e., something valid up to a planned date).
3) Distinguish varying levels of precision; sort of a simple version of the Allen functions.

All datetimes are of the same format: '2021-06-01T08:03:27.12324-6:00'^^xsd:dateTime. This is compatible with and a subset of ISO 8601.

Time zone offset, such as -6:00 (of which there are a few dozen) is recognized in the date itself, as shown. The actual time zone standard (of which there are 131) may optionally be attached to the event or other object itself.

There will be many historical dates that do not have a time zone offset (e.g., Lincoln's birthday, as well as about 75% of all legacy systems), and in that case the offset can be omitted.

The conventions for precision that are repeated in each property name are as follows:
	- *DateTime is an abstraction over the various precisions of its subproperties.
	- *Date refers to a calendar date (e.g., birthdays and invoice dates) and is assumed to have precision of one day. Time zone offset is allowed.
	- *Minute refers to clock time; e.g., a meeting will start at 9:15 with a timezone offset. Precision is assumed to have precision of one minute.
	- *Microsecond refers to system time, and it will be as precise as the system can supply; typically at least milliseconds, sometime microseconds.""" .

          <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#definition> """**Overview of the CAP Code**

1. **What it is**  
   - The “CAP Code” refers to the *UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing*.  
   - It is drawn up by the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP).  
   - It covers non-broadcast advertising (e.g., print, online, social media, direct marketing, and promotional marketing).  
   - Although people sometimes assume it is part of UK statutory law, it is in fact a *self-regulatory code*.

2. **Who enforces it**  
   - The UK’s independent advertising regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (**ASA**), administers and enforces the CAP Code.  
   - The ASA is not a government body but is recognized by the government and by the courts as the lead regulator for advertising in the UK. It operates largely as a self-regulatory organization but also works in partnership with bodies that do have statutory powers (e.g., Trading Standards).

---

**How Enforcement Works**

1. **ASA Rulings**  
   - If the ASA finds an advertisement in breach of the CAP Code (for instance, for being misleading, harmful, or offensive), it will issue a formal ruling.  
   - The advertiser must then *amend or withdraw* the offending ad.  
   - The ASA publishes its rulings on its website, which can lead to reputational damage—“naming and shaming” advertisers who break the rules.

2. **Sanctions**  
   - If an advertiser refuses to comply with an ASA ruling, a series of escalating sanctions can follow:  
     - **Ad Alerts**: The ASA can send bulletins to media owners urging them not to run the advertiser’s ads until they comply.  
     - **Pre-vetting/Pre-clearance**: The advertiser may be required to have all future ads checked and approved by the ASA or CAP before publication.  
     - **Referral to Trading Standards**: In serious or persistent cases, the ASA can refer the advertiser to Trading Standards, which *does* have statutory powers (including the ability to levy fines or prosecute if the ad breaks consumer protection laws).

3. **Fines and legal penalties**  
   - The ASA itself *does not usually fine* advertisers (as it is not a statutory body). Its main powers are rulings, instructions not to run certain ads, and reputational/regulatory pressure.  
   - However, if the advertiser persists in breaking the rules or is found to be misleading consumers in a way that violates consumer protection legislation, the matter can be escalated to Trading Standards or other statutory bodies.  
   - In those cases, the advertiser could face formal legal action, including *fines, penalties, or prosecutions*.

---

**Key Takeaways**

- The CAP Code is a *self-regulatory* set of guidelines for non-broadcast advertising in the UK—*not* a piece of primary legislation.  
- The ASA enforces the CAP Code by issuing rulings and imposing various sanctions designed to ensure compliance (such as withdrawing ads, naming and shaming, or pre-clearing future ads).  
- While the ASA does *not* typically issue fines in its own right, it can refer persistent or serious offenders to bodies with *statutory powers* (e.g., Trading Standards), which *can* impose fines or other legal actions.  
- Therefore, although the CAP Code itself is not “the law,” it is underpinned by strong industry commitment and the possibility of legal enforcement if a business repeatedly flouts the Code or breaches consumer protection laws.

                                                           """UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing, issued by the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP). It sets out the rules that govern advertising in the UK (excluding TV and radio, which are covered by the BCAP Code). The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) enforces these rules.

Key points about the CAP Code:

Scope: It applies to most forms of non-broadcast marketing communications, including print ads, online ads, social media posts (including influencer marketing), email marketing, and promotional materials.

Aim: The CAP Code is designed to ensure that ads are legal, decent, honest, and truthful. It also sets standards for areas like misleading advertising, harm and offence, children’s advertising, and more.

Enforcement: The ASA investigates complaints from the public and can request that advertisers amend or withdraw advertisements that breach the Code.

However, crucially, propositions are not themselves linguistic expressions. For instance, the English sentence \"Snow is white\" denotes the same proposition as the German sentence \"Schnee ist weiß\" even though the two sentences are not the same. Similarly, propositions can also be characterized as the objects of belief and other propositional attitudes. For instance if someone believes that the sky is blue, the object of their belief is the proposition that the sky is blue.

If yes...−
IT'S GREENWASHING
For assessing this indicator, it is important to understand whether a) the exact scope of action and b) the limitations or system boundaries are transparently communicated. Even if not all stages of life cycle or not all scopes/cumulative impacts can be assessed for the claim, if boundaries are clearly communicated (what is and what is not assessed) and there is a clear pathway of improving the coverage of scope, that is not a greenwash. Likewise, the claimed product/service should not contribute to any significant negative impacts on the environment nor should result in an undue transfer of such impacts (unless the total net environmental benefit has been significantly improved). Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is the most often used tool to assess different environmental aspects, although this approach comes with limitations. When assessing a claim related to environmental impacts, the product/service’s impact over its whole life cycle (on and off-site) is relevant. For the organization's impacts, the GRI Standards could provide an extensive list of specific measures. For products, all production steps including (where applicable) extraction through production, use, and postuse need to be included. An LCA should follow internationally accepted standards (e.g. ISO14000 series (ISO 2006)). Claims lead to greenwashing where they reflect only part of the life cycle/impacts and do not make clear which part they refer to thereby creating a misleading impression about the overall impact on the environment.""" ,

Absolute claims need to be supported by a high level of substantiation. Comparative claims such as “greener” “friendlier” \"more sustainable\" can be justified if the advertised product/organization/service provides environmental benefit over that of the organizations’ previous products/services or competitors’ products/services, and the basis of the comparison is clear. Similarly, if the advertised \"better/greener\" products/services only constitute a minority of the same product/service range within the organization creating the impression that it is the dominant type of product/service, this has to be transparently communicated, otherwise it falls under this category of greenwashing.""" ,

If yes...−
IT'S GREENWASHING
Claiming biodiversity or carbon neutrality or a reduction of environmental harm based predominantly on offsetting can mislead people to believe that the claimant is doing more to mitigate environmental harm than they are. For many, overuse of offsetting risks justifying the continuation of business-as-usual practices that damage the environment. Decades of experience with offsets have proven that they are unlikely to provide real long-term gains to balance the certain, often irreversible, destruction resulting from certain business activities. Terms such as “climate neutral” or “climate positive” that rely on offsetting will be banned from the EU by 2026 as part of a new regulations on misleading environmental claims. IUCN, a respected global authority on the state of nature and what is needed to safeguard it, concluded that “…evidence is lacking as to the extent to which no net loss (NNL) / net gains (NG) and offset policies are achieving their goals or contributing to better biodiversity outcomes in the jurisdictions where they exist.” (IUCN, 2014) (NewClimate Institute, 2020). At the same time, well-meaning investments by organizations in environmental protection projects are very much needed and they can be communicated. To this end, NewClimate’s Climate Responsibility approach (NewClimate Institute, 2020) calls for financially supporting others’ climate action, and disclosing that support within company reports, while not using them to “net-out’’ own impacts.""" ,

The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear.

We acknowledged Repsol’s target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and their objectives regarding emissions from operating assets, net emissions and methane emissions. We also acknowledged their aims and investments regarding biofuels and synthetic fuels. Further we noted the changes made to their investment process. We understood, however, that Repsol did not only accept investment opportunities based on carbon reducing activity.

We acknowledged Repsol’s comment that there is no single solution for sustainability, and that renewable fuels are one element in the company’s strategy to reach net zero by 2050. However, while we agreed that synthetic fuels and biofuels could contribute towards Repsol’s goal of achieving net zero emissions, they would not as a single measure ‘achieve’ net zero emissions. We also considered that in the context of an ad making a claim based on initiatives to achieve net zero, the timeframe of 2050 to achieve that goal was material information that needed to be made clear to consumers.

In the absence of any contextual information explaining that the initiative was part of a wider plan to achieve net zero by 2050, we concluded that the basis of the claim “At Repsol, we are developing biofuels and synthetic fuels to achieve net zero emissions” was not clear and it was likely to mislead as a result.

On this point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1, 3.11 (Misleading Advertising), and 11.1 (Environmental Claims).

Action
The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Repsol that the basis of environmental claims in future marketing communications must be clear, and to ensure that their marketing communications did not misleadingly omit material information, such as how and when Repsol would achieve net zero emissions, and the role that the development of biofuels would play in that plan.""" ,

1. Upheld

The ASA welcomed Repsol’s assurance that the ad would be removed. The CAP Code stated that unqualified claims could mislead if material information was omitted.

The ad appeared within the FT’s digital energy newsletter and elsewhere on the FT website. It would therefore have been seen by both consumers, who may be interested in Repsol as a brand for the products and services they provide, and business readers, such as potential investors, partners and clients. We considered that both audiences would have an awareness that many companies in carbon-intensive industries, including the oil and gas sector, aimed to dramatically reduce their emissions in response to the climate crisis. In addition, both were increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of activities related to higher-carbon products and services, and would be interested in seeking out businesses, including oil and gas companies, who were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services, including towards achieving net zero emissions. However, we considered that consumers and many business readers were unlikely to be aware of the specific details of how companies planned to achieve this.

We considered that both consumers and business readers were likely to interpret the claim, “At Repsol, we are developing biofuels and synthetic fuels to achieve net zero emissions”, in addition to the imagery of nature and the natural environment, as meaning that Repsol’s development of biofuels and synthetic fuels formed a significant element of their current activities that were making meaningful progress towards achieving net zero emissions.

We acknowledged Repsol’s comments regarding their contribution to electrical charging, renewable generation capacity, and reductions in energy consumption and emissions in industrial centres in other facilities. However, notwithstanding current actions towards improving their environmental impact, we understood that a number of Repsol’s new biofuel and synthetic fuel initiatives were not yet in operation. Furthermore, Repsol’s carbon emissions stood at 171 million tonnes of CO2e in 2021 (50% of the emissions of the United Kingdom in 2021, 346.7 Mt CO2e). They produced approximately 600,000 barrels of oil per day. We also understood that Repsol had a substantial oil and gas exploration strategy, owning an interest in 40,660 acres (gross) of oil and gas development and exploration across Europe, Latin America, North America, Africa, and Asia and Oceania.

We acknowledged that Repsol’s hydrocarbons production focused on gas and understood the reasons for that. We also acknowledged that oil would continue to play a legitimate role in the context of energy transition in the future. However, we understood that their focus on the production of biofuels and synthetic fuels to achieve net zero emissions was a fraction of their business activities when compared to their substantial, ongoing, and expanding fossil fuel production. Furthermore, notwithstanding the reasons given for the continued production of oil and gas, we noted that the ad focused solely on an initiative the company suggested would deliver their net zero goal (with no timeframe given) when at the same time, Repsol was continuing to emit notable levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses and would do so for many years into the future.

We understood that consumers could access information about Repsol’s general business activities and plans on their website. However, further information to contextualise how and when Repsol would achieve net zero emissions, and the role that the development of biofuels would play in that plan, was material to consumers’ understanding of the ad’s overall message, and should have appeared in the ad itself.

We therefore concluded that the ad omitted material information and was misleading.

On this point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading Advertising), and 11.1 (Environmental Claims).""" ,

1. Repsol said that by adding the message “Find out more about this and other projects”, accompanied by a button with the message “More information” at the end of the ad, the reader was invited to click and access Repsol’s website. Once accessed, the website provided further information and news related to the company’s global activity. They believed that it was impossible to maintain the attractiveness of the ad and place more information within it.

Repsol explained that the ad was mainly designed for inclusion in the Financial Times (FT) digital energy newsletter sponsored by Repsol, aimed at an informed audience of users who subscribe to it and are interested in issues and news related to the energy sector. They acknowledged that the ad was also published elsewhere on the FT’s website.

Repsol said that they opened Spain’s first electric charging point, and operated Spain’s largest public electric vehicle charging network. In addition, they are a significant operator in the electricity and gas market in Spain, with 1.5 million customers. They currently have an installed renewable generation capacity of more than 1,800 MW worldwide and plan to reach 6,000 MW by 2025 and 20,000 MW by 2030. They produce an average of approximately 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which nearly 70% is gas. Their hydrocarbons production is focused on gas since the fuel helps transition from higher-emissions coal to electricity production, thus speeding up the energy transition. They further stated that oil will still be needed in a more decarbonized world, even according to the International Energy Agency’s most aggressive scenarios.

Repsol summarised that they have reduced energy consumption in their industrial centres by 20% in the period 2011-2022 and reduced emissions by more than 20% in all their facilities.

2. Repsol said they were aware that there is no single solution for sustainability. They explained that renewable fuels are one of the main elements in the company’s strategy to reach net zero by 2050. They aimed to reduce 55% of emissions from operated assets and 30% of net emissions by 2030. They also stated that they set a target for reducing their methane emissions intensity to 0.20% in 2025, which would be a reduction of 85%.

Repsol said that they will allocate more than €5 billion in organic investment and that 35% of these investments will be allocated to low-carbon technologies and projects. The company has implemented a methodology to determine whether a new investment is in line with its decarbonisation targets, and any investment proposed to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors must include a report prepared by their Sustainability Department. In the second half of 2023 they are introducing a new biofuels facility that will supply 250,000 tons per year of advanced biofuels. The use of these fuels will make it possible to avoid emissions of 900,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. They also are preparing to build synthetic fuels and urban waste recovery plants and have partnered with Enerkem to develop a plant which will process around 400,000 tons of non-recyclable municipal solid waste to produce around 240,000 tons of renewable methanol (biomethanol).

Repsol explained that renewable fuels make up 10% of their fuel sales in Spain and they expect to grow this aggressively. They have existing pilot projects in three cities which involve 100% biofuel pumps for fleet vehicles and have also launched a recent initiative to pay customers for their used cooking oil for incorporation into the processing of fatty residues. Repsol said they are committed to acting ethically and would remove the ad immediately.""" ;

The contested advertising concerned a sticker on Chiquita's bananas which included the statement \"CO2 Neutral.\" The complaint alleged that Chiquita's \"CO2 Neutral\" claim was not true. Several statements were pointed out on Chiquita's website which referred to CO2 emission reduction by 30 percent by the end of 2030. The Commission found the sticker on the bananas with the claim \"CO2 Neutral\" to be misleading pursuant to article 2 of the Code for Environmental Advertising (MRC), as it did not contain any reference to information about the interpretation of this claim. Because any context was lacking, the meaning of this claim was unclear to the average consumer. The Committee noted that the meaning of the environmental claim had had to be made clear in the advertisement. The Committee found it insufficient that the meaning of \"CO2 Neutral\" was clarified on a separate website. It also noted that the mere mention of a website was insufficient to make the meaning of the claim clear. Because the claims were admissible on the basis of the foregoing, the Committee did not have to examine the question whether Chiquita was able to demonstrate the correctness of its absolute environmental claim pursuant to article 3 MRC.
