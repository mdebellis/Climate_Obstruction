The subproperties allow the ontologist to do three things:
1) Distinguish start and end times.
2) Indicate whether a time is planned or actual. This is useful for everything from project management to calendar appointments and the like. It is also useful for date effectivities; i.e., something valid up to a planned date).
3) Distinguish varying levels of precision; sort of a simple version of the Allen functions.

All datetimes are of the same format: '2021-06-01T08:03:27.12324-6:00'^^xsd:dateTime. This is compatible with and a subset of ISO 8601.

Time zone offset, such as -6:00 (of which there are a few dozen) is recognized in the date itself, as shown. The actual time zone standard (of which there are 131) may optionally be attached to the event or other object itself.

There will be many historical dates that do not have a time zone offset (e.g., Lincoln's birthday, as well as about 75% of all legacy systems), and in that case the offset can be omitted.

The conventions for precision that are repeated in each property name are as follows:
	- *DateTime is an abstraction over the various precisions of its subproperties.
	- *Date refers to a calendar date (e.g., birthdays and invoice dates) and is assumed to have precision of one day. Time zone offset is allowed.
	- *Minute refers to clock time; e.g., a meeting will start at 9:15 with a timezone offset. Precision is assumed to have precision of one minute.
	- *Microsecond refers to system time, and it will be as precise as the system can supply; typically at least milliseconds, sometime microseconds.""" .

            <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#definition> """Regulating ads 
The ASA respond to complaints but we also check ads across media to make sure they’re sticking to the rules. We monitor ads in sectors where there are potential consumer protection issues or where there are societal concerns about specific products, for instance age-restricted products like alcohol, gambling or electronic cigarettes. 

Together with CAP, the ASA works to support the industry to help them get their ads right before they are published. For example by providing guidance, pre-publication advice and training for the industry. Last year, we provided 1 million pieces of advice and training for the industry, most of which was free of charge.

What happens before an ad is published? 
The Advertising Codes require that advertisers hold evidence to prove the claims that they make before they are published or aired. We expect all advertisers to follow the rules when creating their ad campaigns. 

Pre-clearance for TV and radio advertising 
The vast majority of TV and radio ads are pre-cleared before they are broadcast. 

Under their licences broadcasters must take reasonable steps to ensure that the ads they broadcast stick to the UK Code of Broadcast Advertising. 

To help them do this, the broadcasters have established and funded two pre-clearance centres:

Clearcast for television commercials.
Radiocentre for radio ads. 
Non-broadcast advertising
There are many millions of non-broadcast ads published every year in the UK, so it would be impossible to check every one of them before they appear. For example there are more than 30 million press advertisements and 100 million pieces of direct marketing every year. 

However, to help advertisers get their ads right, CAP provides a range of advice, guidance and training, including free pre-publication Copy Advice service. 

We also encourage advertisers and anyone with an interest in the rules or who is involved in producing ads to sign up for Insight and Update, CAP’s advice newsletters here which provide current and timely advice on the latest positions on hundreds of different advertising issues. 

Regulation after an advertisement has appeared 
Even though many steps are taken to ensure ads are in line with the Codes before they are aired or published, consumers have the right to complain about ads they have seen, which they believe to be misleading, harmful or offensive.

The ASA can act on just one complaint. We don’t play a numbers game: our concern is whether the ad rules have been broken. 

Find out more about how we handle complaints

Sanctions
The Advertising Codes and the ASA’s rulings have universal coverage across the advertising industry. Advertisers cannot opt out of them. 

If we have judged an ad has broken the advertising rules, then it must be withdrawn or amended. The vast majority of advertisers stick to the ASA’s rulings and they act quickly to amend or withdraw an ad that breaks the Codes. 

We have a range of sanctions to act against the small number of advertisers who are either unwilling or unable to work within the rules and to ensure they are brought into line. In 2013 Trading Standards took over from the Office of Fair Trading as the ASA’s ‘legal backstop’ on the non-broadcast side.  On the broadcast side, Ofcom acts as our ‘legal backstop’.""" ,

          rdfs:label "CAP Code" ;
          <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#definition> """**Overview of the CAP Code**

1. **What it is**  
   - The “CAP Code” refers to the *UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing*.  
   - It is drawn up by the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP).  
   - It covers non-broadcast advertising (e.g., print, online, social media, direct marketing, and promotional marketing).  
   - Although people sometimes assume it is part of UK statutory law, it is in fact a *self-regulatory code*.

2. **Who enforces it**  
   - The UK’s independent advertising regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (**ASA**), administers and enforces the CAP Code.  
   - The ASA is not a government body but is recognized by the government and by the courts as the lead regulator for advertising in the UK. It operates largely as a self-regulatory organization but also works in partnership with bodies that do have statutory powers (e.g., Trading Standards).

---

**How Enforcement Works**

1. **ASA Rulings**  
   - If the ASA finds an advertisement in breach of the CAP Code (for instance, for being misleading, harmful, or offensive), it will issue a formal ruling.  
   - The advertiser must then *amend or withdraw* the offending ad.  
   - The ASA publishes its rulings on its website, which can lead to reputational damage—“naming and shaming” advertisers who break the rules.

2. **Sanctions**  
   - If an advertiser refuses to comply with an ASA ruling, a series of escalating sanctions can follow:  
     - **Ad Alerts**: The ASA can send bulletins to media owners urging them not to run the advertiser’s ads until they comply.  
     - **Pre-vetting/Pre-clearance**: The advertiser may be required to have all future ads checked and approved by the ASA or CAP before publication.  
     - **Referral to Trading Standards**: In serious or persistent cases, the ASA can refer the advertiser to Trading Standards, which *does* have statutory powers (including the ability to levy fines or prosecute if the ad breaks consumer protection laws).

3. **Fines and legal penalties**  
   - The ASA itself *does not usually fine* advertisers (as it is not a statutory body). Its main powers are rulings, instructions not to run certain ads, and reputational/regulatory pressure.  
   - However, if the advertiser persists in breaking the rules or is found to be misleading consumers in a way that violates consumer protection legislation, the matter can be escalated to Trading Standards or other statutory bodies.  
   - In those cases, the advertiser could face formal legal action, including *fines, penalties, or prosecutions*.

---

**Key Takeaways**

- The CAP Code is a *self-regulatory* set of guidelines for non-broadcast advertising in the UK—*not* a piece of primary legislation.  
- The ASA enforces the CAP Code by issuing rulings and imposing various sanctions designed to ensure compliance (such as withdrawing ads, naming and shaming, or pre-clearing future ads).  
- While the ASA does *not* typically issue fines in its own right, it can refer persistent or serious offenders to bodies with *statutory powers* (e.g., Trading Standards), which *can* impose fines or other legal actions.  
- Therefore, although the CAP Code itself is not “the law,” it is underpinned by strong industry commitment and the possibility of legal enforcement if a business repeatedly flouts the Code or breaches consumer protection laws.

It sets out the rules that govern advertising in the UK (excluding TV and radio, which are covered by the BCAP Code). The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) enforces these rules.

Key points about the CAP Code:

Scope: It applies to most forms of non-broadcast marketing communications, including print ads, online ads, social media posts (including influencer marketing), email marketing, and promotional materials.

Aim: The CAP Code is designed to ensure that ads are legal, decent, honest, and truthful. It also sets standards for areas like misleading advertising, harm and offence, children’s advertising, and more.

Enforcement: The ASA investigates complaints from the public and can request that advertisers amend or withdraw advertisements that breach the Code.

In the political and social world it is not uncommon for hypotheses (especially those that go outside what the main stream media considers acceptable topics and points of view) to be dismissed as conspiracy theories which then turn out to be true. E.g., that the US provoked the Gulf of Tonkin incident, that the incident was part of a planned campaign designed to provoke the North Vietnamese into an action that could be used to justify increased US involvement in the Vietnam war was once branded a conspiracy theory, however, the publication of the Pentagon Papers clearly demonstrated that this was indeed the truth. With that caveat in mind our definition is 1) any theory or hypothesis that has no evidence from reliable (non-partisan) sources,2) that contradicts accepted science, or published literature from reliable sources and 3) that furhters a specific political agenda. If a theory meets all 3 criteria it is a Conspiracy Theory" .

The criteria of certification schemes need to demonstrate clear environmental benefits compared with competing products/organizations, should be easily publicly accessible and labels cannot be capable of being confused with other labels, including, for example, labels of publicly run labelling schemes or schemes of competitors.’ (European Commission, 2016). \"All certification schemes shall have a clearly defined scope and also indicate what is not included – to avoid 'scope creep'\" (EDPB, 2021). An important element of transparency and increased accountability and credibility of a certification scheme is the publication of key documents (e.g. standards, inspection guidelines, audit reports) and information related to certification bodies and complaints on the organization's website. These allow stakeholders to evaluate the performance of certificate holders and supply chain actors against the certification scheme’s standards, and to assess how good job the auditors and certification bodies have done. If information is not readily available on the website, it should be available by requesting the standard owner.""" ,

If yes...−
IT'S GREENWASHING via Dubious Certifications & Labels
Most certification schemes have a dispute or grievance mechanism that enables complaints to be made against certified companies and operations, the conformity assessment bodies (CABs) and the scheme itself. A growing literature provides somewhat mixed evidence regarding the potential for certification to reduce environmental and social impacts (Lambin et al., 2018). Many certification schemes are unable to protect ecosystems' and people’s rights, and thus additional due diligence is required to provide an assurance of responsibly sourced produce. An effective due diligence screening program allows an organization to make an informed decision about whether it is safe to proceed with the certification. Also, many certification and standards systems have a chain of custody model or traceability approach, which is critical for downstream actors to understand who they are sourcing from. However, a Chain of Custody standard might only prescribe handling processes, and not include social abuses or environmental issues that could occur across the supply chain (ISEAL Alliance, 2020). However, often these mechanisms and the cases heard under them are not made public. They may not have clear processes or be easy to use, and complaints may not be addressed in a timely and comprehensive manner. They may also not provide for effective compensation to be paid to those who have been negatively affected. Certifications may also lack a third-party complaint procedure that ensures the process is fair and independent. CABs should not be able to act as both certifier and complainant. Lacking these accountability mechanisms mean the scheme can easily greenwash harmful activities.""" ,

When any of the three conditions listed in the indicator question is true, the scheme can be accused of greenwashing.""" .

IT'S Empty Claims GREENWASHING
In 2020, the fossil fuel industry spent $10 million on Facebook ads selling “innovative” climate solutions and visions of a “lower-carbon future” (InfluenceMap, 2021). Although challenging to obtain, information about marketing budget may be crucial for assessing potential greenwash. One source could be the annual data available for the biggest companies' ad budgets (Statista, 2024). This indicator also captures those cases, where the marketing budget behind the claim/campaign is much larger when compared to the marketing of other products/initiatives with a higher proportion of the overall business activity (e.g. an energy company is disproportionately spending on communicating 'green' initiatives that make up a small fraction of its business). The most famous example of this form of greenwashing is ExxonMobil's marketing of biofuels made from algae, where the marketing budget was reportedly $100 million, the actual investment was $350 million, and the project itself was cancelled after it became clear that it would never achieve scale (Westervelt, 2023).""" ,

Claims may fall on a continuum of verifiable support to having little or no proof. To avoid false advertising claims, organizations need to be aware of and comply with relevant statutes and regulations that govern competition and advertising in their jurisdiction and industry. Falsity does not require illegality. This greenwash category is commonly used by organizations to suggest that their preferred solution is also an environmentally responsible one. For example, the fossil fuel industry recently began buying ads that portray natural gas as a green fuel source, when methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, or arguments that decarbonization would make energy unaffordable (Grist, 2021). If there is significant disagreement or doubt over the environmental impacts of certain practices/products/services, the organization should refrain from marketing the message altogether (European Commission, 2021).

Inadequate quantification is a common category of greenwashing. For example, natural capital accounting is a controversial methodology that attempts to put a price on nature and ecosystem. The approach has significant conceptual weaknesses and produces figures irrelevant for demonstrating the actual state of or change within the physical environment (e.g. emission cuts). Likewise, communicating on the wrong metrics, e.g., outcome instead of impact, intensity instead of absolute emissions, or using flattering aggregate figures could also fall into this category. For example, salmon farmed in open ocean pens have significant documented negative environmental impacts, but industry actors may use statistics from research on \"aquaculture\" to make environmental claims about the industry because other types of aquaculture, such as farming shellfish and seaweed, have documented positive environmental effects.""" ,

IT'S GREENWASHING via Inconsistent Organization in Practice.
A growing literature provides mixed evidence regarding the potential for certification to reduce environmental and social impacts (Lambin et al., 2018). Many certification schemes are unable to protect ecosystems' and people’s rights, and thus additional due diligence is required to provide an assurance of responsibly sourced produce. An effective due diligence screening program allows an organization to make an informed decision about whether it is safe to proceed with the certification. Also, many certification and standards systems have a chain of custody model or traceability approach, which is critical for downstream actors to understand who they are sourcing from. However, a Chain of Custody standard might only prescribe handling processes, and not include social abuses or environmental issues that could occur across the supply chain (ISEAL Alliance, 2024). This indicator ensures that when retailers or producers communicate about their (own brand) products being certified they do not merely rely on voluntary certification schemes but ensure that they have a regularly updated effective due diligence policy in place.""" ,

This indicator is intended to capture the green marketing of products/services/policies that are presumed to be dangerous or unsafe such tobacco or herbicides. Dangerous could mean containing substances that are toxic, hazardous to the environment, carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR), causing endocrine disruption to human health or the environment, persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic (PBT) without explicitly mentioning this fact when publishing the green claim. If expert studies give rise to significant disagreement or doubt over environmental impacts of certain practices/products/services, the organization should refrain from marketing the message altogether (European Commission, 2021). Highly controversial solutions involve the choice of ecologically counter productive practices that do not maintain or enhance the ecological quality. Having a stake in/supporting fossil fuels (including gas, oils sands, and hydraulic fracking), nuclear energy, agro-fuels from primary crops, utilization of bioenergy as transitional technology, intensive industrial agriculture, sustainable aviation fuels, bottom trawling, etc. are just few examples of such controversial practices.

Critical studies of environmental sustainability initiatives point to the need to evaluate the influence of (industry or other) groups on organizations making green claims. Social network analyses (e.g., Brulle 2019; Farrell 2015; Pattberg 2007) can be used to determine the policy position, funding contributions, or political involvement of think tanks, trade associations or other groups. Affiliation also refers to profiting from, investing in, or collaborating with other organizations. For instance, according to Client Earth's Greenwashing file, Chevron (which makes claims about reducing carbon intensity and investing in renewable and “low-carbon” energies) is a member of a number of trade associations and lobby groups which have sought to block a transition away from fossil fuels (the American Petroleum Institute, the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Legislative Exchange Council). Studies show how these associations have been responsible over recent years for obstructive lobbying practices against urgently needed climate policies and laws, and there are concerns that Chevron—like many other fossil fuel companies—continues to fight climate measures, including behind closed doors.""" ,

For assessing this indicator, it is important to understand whether a) the exact scope of action and b) the limitations or system boundaries are transparently communicated. Even if not all stages of life cycle or not all scopes/cumulative impacts can be assessed for the claim, if boundaries are clearly communicated (what is and what is not assessed) and there is a clear pathway of improving the coverage of scope, that is not a greenwash. Likewise, the claimed product/service should not contribute to any significant negative impacts on the environment nor should result in an undue transfer of such impacts (unless the total net environmental benefit has been significantly improved). Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is the most often used tool to assess different environmental aspects, although this approach comes with limitations. When assessing a claim related to environmental impacts, the product/service’s impact over its whole life cycle (on and off-site) is relevant. For the organization's impacts, the GRI Standards could provide an extensive list of specific measures. For products, all production steps including (where applicable) extraction through production, use, and postuse need to be included. An LCA should follow internationally accepted standards (e.g. ISO14000 series (ISO 2006)). Claims lead to greenwashing where they reflect only part of the life cycle/impacts and do not make clear which part they refer to thereby creating a misleading impression about the overall impact on the environment.""" ,

IT'S Selective Disclosure GREENWASHING
Claiming biodiversity or carbon neutrality or a reduction of environmental harm based predominantly on offsetting can mislead people to believe that the claimant is doing more to mitigate environmental harm than they are. For many, overuse of offsetting risks justifying the continuation of business-as-usual practices that damage the environment. Decades of experience with offsets have proven that they are unlikely to provide real long-term gains to balance the certain, often irreversible, destruction resulting from certain business activities. Terms such as “climate neutral” or “climate positive” that rely on offsetting will be banned from the EU by 2026 as part of a new regulations on misleading environmental claims. IUCN, a respected global authority on the state of nature and what is needed to safeguard it, concluded that “…evidence is lacking as to the extent to which no net loss (NNL) / net gains (NG) and offset policies are achieving their goals or contributing to better biodiversity outcomes in the jurisdictions where they exist.” (IUCN, 2014) (NewClimate Institute, 2020). At the same time, well-meaning investments by organizations in environmental protection projects are very much needed and they can be communicated. To this end, NewClimate’s Climate Responsibility approach (NewClimate Institute, 2020) calls for financially supporting others’ climate action, and disclosing that support within company reports, while not using them to “net-out’’ own impacts.""" ,

Claims can refer to a part/feature of a product/organization (or simply to the packaging) instead of the whole product/organization creating confusion among consumers about the claim. A typical example maybe a plastic package containing a new product which is labelled “recyclable” without further elaboration.

IT'S GREENWASHING Vagueness
Words such as \"sustainably sourced”, “eco-friendly”, “green”, “sustainable”, “non-toxic”, “biodegradable”, \"natural\", etc are ambiguous terms. The absence of clear definitions for many green marketing terms has made it difficult for consumers to weigh how credible these claims are. Statements such as ‘good for you, good for the planet, good for the future’ also raise as many questions as they answer. Is it good for the planet because of the packaging, because of how the item is produced, because it is healthy for you and the soil or simply because it's less harmful than similar products? Such claims require substantiation, covering the whole lifecycle of the product. Similarly, one cannot just say that plant-based burgers or pet food are better for the planet than a traditional meat burger/meat-based pet food. What ingredients contain the plant-based product, how has it been produced, with what inputs and where was it shipped from? Unless clearly defined and adequately substantiated with easily accessible, independent, verifiable scientific information, such claims remain greenwash.""" ,

There is a wide range of terms and claims used by companies in addition to “net zero”, such as \"carbon negative\" or \"climate positive\"; or that they seek to achieve \"net negative\" emissions or \"deep decarbonisation\"; or that they plan to become \"emissions-free\" or achieve \"zero emissions\"; or that they are committed to a \"1.5 degrees C pathway\"; or invest in low-carbon technologies”. \"Most “net zero” targets involve vaguely-written plans with loopholes that allow emissions to continue rising - often for decades after commitments have been taken. The Science Based Targets Initiative (Science Based Targets, 2021) requires that \"companies set targets based on emission reductions through direct action within their own boundaries or their value chains\" and \"offsets are only considered to be an option for companies wanting to contribute to finance additional emission reductions beyond their science-based target/net-zero” (Ibid). Established international best practice guidelines in this area require that organizations/ countries: a) measure, track and regularly publish their emissions according to the latest IPCC or GHG Protocol guidance (e.g. scope 1 and 2 emissions and scope 3 emissions to the furthest extent possible); b) have a clear strategy, implementation planning process and interim targets to reach any future single point targets AND c) develop and publish a long-term strategy with a decarbonisation pathway that prioritizes reducing own emissions.""" ,

1., 2. & 3. Upheld

The CAP Code required that absolute environmental claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation.

The ASA considered that the claims “Eco-Friendly Aviation”, “Sustainable Aviation” and “Turn Flying Into A Force For Good” read together in the context in which they appeared would be understood by businesses to mean that 4AIR offered services that could ensure aviation operations did not cause environmental damage. While we acknowledged the use of “future” in the “Future of Sustainable Aviation”, which could refer to an aspirational goal, the claim was immediately followed by the text “Learn How To Turn Flying Into A Force For Good” which would be understood by businesses to mean that by using 4AIR’s services their business would be capable of having an immediate positive impact on the environment.

We therefore expected to see a high level of evidence that substantiated the claims, taking into account the full life cycle of the products and services associated with 4AIR’s services. While we accepted that 4AIR did not own or operate any aircraft, its services were directly linked with aviation, and we therefore considered the claims in the context of the full life cycle of aviation operations.

We acknowledged that Sustainable Aviation Fuel produced lower emissions than traditional aviation fuel. However, we understood that aviation, even with the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, produced high levels of CO2 and non-CO2 emissions which contributed to climate change. We further acknowledged that 4AIR gave businesses the opportunity to support the Aviation Climate Fund’s research into future technologies related to reducing the negative environmental impact of the aviation industry. We understood, however, that the results of that initiative would be delivered decades into the future and therefore concluded that support of it was not adequate substantiation to evidence the claim “Turn Flying Into A Force For Good” as it would be understood in the context of the ad.

Furthermore, we understood that at the time the ad appeared, there were no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry which would adequately substantiate absolute claims such as “Eco-friendly Aviation” and “Sustainable Aviation” as we considered businesses would interpret them in the context of the ad.

We concluded that the claims were likely to mislead businesses in relation to 4AIR’s capability to ensure that aviation operations which purchased its services did not negatively impact the environment, and the ad therefore breached the Code.

1., 2. & 3. 4AIR LLC said they were a sustainability solutions provider that sought to address climate impacts of all types. Their target customers were primarily aviation operators. Their programmes addressed the operational impact of their customer’s aircraft and offered solutions for related ground emissions. Their approach simplified reporting on metrics as part of environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks and aligned with industry standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG).

They said that they used a variety of mechanisms to help an operator implement a sustainability programme and their carbon credits were quantified and verified through bodies such as the American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve, Verified Carbon Standard (VERRA), and The Gold Standard. In addition to carbon credits, they assisted customers with locating airports with physical supplies of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (jet fuel made from non-fossil sources such as used cooking oil or grease), which they stated could reduce emissions by as much as 80%.

Regarding their advertising, 4AIR said their use of the claims “Eco-Friendly Aviation”, “Sustainable Aviation”, and “Turn Flying Into A Force For Good” was substantiated by their programmes where Sustainable Aviation Fuel was used to reduce customers’ life-cycle emissions. In addition to Sustainable Aviation Fuel, they used a more comprehensive approach that went beyond ‘carbon neutral’. In relation to the claim “Turn Flying Into A Force For Good”, they facilitated contributions made by their customers to the non-profit Aviation Climate Fund (ACF), which conducted research to develop future technologies needed to reduce the dependency of aviation operators on fossil-based fuels.

On the question of the full life cycle of the products associated with their services, 4AIR stated they did not own, manufacture, maintain or operate any aircraft.""" ;

The CAP Code required that absolute environmental claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation.

The ASA acknowledged Lufthansa’s view that the claim, “CONNECTING THE WORLD. PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” in isolation was ambiguous and not clearly linked to the environment. However, we considered that the claim “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” was likely to be interpreted by consumers as an environmental reference to how Lufthansa's approach to aviation was protecting the future of the world, given that this text appeared immediately after the text “CONNECTING THE WORLD” and was superimposed on a picture of the globe.

We noted Lufthansa’s comments that the campaign was based on specific steps taken to be more environmentally friendly, including aspirations to become carbon neutral by 2050 and to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030. However, the claim “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” was not qualified with this information. We considered the claim was likely to be understood by consumers to mean that Lufthansa had already taken significant mitigating steps to ensure that the net environmental impact of their business was not harmful.

We understood that air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. We noted the initiatives and targets Lufthansa said they were committed to delivering in pursuit of their stated goal, but many of these initiatives were targeted to deliver results only years or decades into the future. We also understood that there were currently no environmental initiatives or commercially viable technologies in the aviation industry which would substantiate the absolute green claim “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE”, as we considered consumers would interpret it.

We concluded that, because the basis of the claim had not been made clear and it had not been adequately substantiated, the ad breached the Code.

Deutsche Lufthansa AG t/a Lufthansa said that the ad contained a clear hyperlink to the website www.makechangefly.com, which formed part of the wider “#MakeChangeFly” campaign. The purpose of the ad and wider campaign was to address the need to reduce the impact of flying on the environment and making consumers aware, chiefly via the website, of how Lufthansa were achieving that.

They said that the tagline, “CONNECTING THE WORLD. PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” was open to interpretation, but in conjunction with the imagery it would not be understood as an absolute promise about their service, especially one linked to the environment, that their services caused no harm to the environment. They said it was also important to emphasise that “CONNECTING THE WORLD” was not an absolute claim and that it would therefore be inconsistent to conclude the second half of the tagline, “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” was absolute, when the former part was not.

They explained that the imagery of half a plane and half a globe even presented the tagline as a potential dichotomy. In addition, the tagline in the ad contained no absolute statement stating that flying, or Lufthansa, had no impact on the environment and it would be incorrect to conclude the average consumer would understand the slogan in that way. They said that “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” would not be understood by consumers as a narrow and distinct reference to protecting the environment and the slogan would be seen by consumers as a mission statement intended to draw people to the website to raise awareness of the environmental issues related to flying and the steps Lufthansa had taken to address them. It was only by going to the website was the ad clearly linked to environmental claims and the website had sufficient explanation and was clearly qualified.

The website stated that air transport connected people, countries and cultures and that its economic importance was wide ranging, creating employment and transporting goods. The website also made clear that Lufthansa were aware that the aviation industry emitted CO2, which had a negative impact on the environment. It was for that reason the website stated that they took their responsibility to climate change seriously and outlined the steps they were taking to protect the environment such as highlighting the purchase of new aircraft with lower fuel consumption and how Lufthansa were one of the largest purchasers of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. They said any consumer who saw the ad would be able to see, via the website, the environmental impact of air travel and Lufthansa’s actions to mitigate it. The website therefore provided context and substantiation for the ad. Due to the qualifying information in the ad, via the website link, consumers would not be misled as to Lufthansa’s environmental impact.""" ;

1. & 2. Upheld

The CAP Code required that absolute environmental claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation.

Ads (a) and (b) stated that because Etihad understood the impact flying had on the environment, they were “taking a louder, bolder approach to sustainable aviation”. While the accompanying video in ad (a) mentioned, “Etihad Guest Miles”, “ETIHAD GUEST CONSCIOUS CHOICES” and said that they had won an environmental award, it gave no further context or explanation as to how “sustainable aviation” was being achieved. The video in ad (b) said Etihad were cutting back on single-use plastics, flying with the most modern and efficient planes which had a “smaller footprint” and had won an environmental award. However, we considered such qualifying information was material to consumers' understanding of the claim, and without it being made clear in the initial text, consumers would understand the \"sustainable aviation\" claim to be about Etihad's whole business.

The ASA acknowledged Etihad’s comments that the claim “sustainable aviation” would be understood, especially in the aviation industry, as a long-term, multifaceted goal, which included their aspiration to reach “net zero” carbon emissions by 2050. However, we noted that the ads were aimed at the general public and not specifically at those in the airline industry and that neither ad mentioned Etihad’s desire to be “net-zero” by 2050 or positioned the claim “sustainable aviation” as a long-term aspiration.

We acknowledged Etihad’s comments about the use of modern aircraft and flight practices to reduce emissions. We understood, however, that air travel continued to produce high levels of CO2 and non-CO2 emissions which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. We noted the further initiatives and targets Etihad said they were committed to delivering in pursuit of their stated goal but many of these initiatives were targeted to only deliver results years or decades into the future. Further to that, initiatives such as reducing single use plastics and using more efficient aircraft were not adequate substantiation to evidence a \"sustainable aviation\" claim.

While we noted steps were being taken by Etihad to reduce the environmental impact of its service, we understood that there were currently no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry which would adequately substantiate an absolute green claim such as “sustainable aviation” as we considered consumers would interpret it in this context.

We concluded, therefore, that the claim exaggerated the impact that flying with Etihad would have on the environment and the ads breached the Code.

1. & 2. Etihad Airways stated that the claim “sustainable aviation” in ads (a) and (b) was not intended to be understood as an absolute solution to the environmental impact from aviation and they did not accept that they would be interpreted in that way. In contrast they said the claim would be widely understood as a long-term and multi-faceted process, in which Etihad had included an aspiration to reach “net zero” carbon emissions by 2050.

They said “sustainable aviation” had been a widely used and publicised term in the aviation industry for a number of years and was used by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Further to that Etihad’s sustainability strategy was in line with EASA’s sustainability priorities and incorporated initiatives by Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government. It focused on solutions to fast-track the transition to cleaner fuels, develop a carbon credits ecosystem locally and support strong standards globally, explore and develop emissions avoidance mechanisms through non-CO2 effects and engaging Etihad’s customers and stakeholders in supporting de-carbonisation.

That multi-faceted approach meant Etihad had to take “bolder” decisions than before, putting in place new initiatives and technology within a coherent strategy focused on sustainability. They provided examples of that “bolder” approach which included a restructure of their fleet to use modern, fuel efficient aircraft. The development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel production in the UAE, in a project that looked at energy and food security. The testing of contrail management mechanisms and optimisation of aircraft descent and ascent operations to save fuel. The use of the latest digital navigation charts and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) burn management methods to find the most efficient way to fly. They had further received support from the Botanical Garden’s Conservation Initiative’s Global Diversity standard, the only international certification that recognised and promoted the protection and restoration of biodiversity. They had engaged Etihad guests and stakeholders in their Conscious Choices programme, which for guests aimed to encourage and reward environmentally friendly habits and for stakeholders aimed to help Etihad to integrate Sustainable Aviation Fuel in their operations. Finally they had also approached local and global regulators to promote ICAO’s goal to reach net zero by 2050 and supported the UAE government in the sector’s net-zero resolution.

Etihad said they had also achieved a number of awards which evidenced their “louder, bolder approach to sustainable aviation”. Those included a stage two certification from International Air Transport Association (IATA) Environment Assessment Programme, a bronze EcoVadis rating, the “Best Airline For Sustainability” from American Business Traveller, a 2022 sustainability award by Nat Geo Traveller China, an “Environmental Sustainability Innovation of the Year” award from CAPA and environmental airline of the year 2022 in the Airline Ratings awards.""" ;

The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear.

We acknowledged Repsol’s target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and their objectives regarding emissions from operating assets, net emissions and methane emissions. We also acknowledged their aims and investments regarding biofuels and synthetic fuels. Further we noted the changes made to their investment process. We understood, however, that Repsol did not only accept investment opportunities based on carbon reducing activity.

We acknowledged Repsol’s comment that there is no single solution for sustainability, and that renewable fuels are one element in the company’s strategy to reach net zero by 2050. However, while we agreed that synthetic fuels and biofuels could contribute towards Repsol’s goal of achieving net zero emissions, they would not as a single measure ‘achieve’ net zero emissions. We also considered that in the context of an ad making a claim based on initiatives to achieve net zero, the timeframe of 2050 to achieve that goal was material information that needed to be made clear to consumers.

In the absence of any contextual information explaining that the initiative was part of a wider plan to achieve net zero by 2050, we concluded that the basis of the claim “At Repsol, we are developing biofuels and synthetic fuels to achieve net zero emissions” was not clear and it was likely to mislead as a result.

On this point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1, 3.11 (Misleading Advertising), and 11.1 (Environmental Claims).

The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

1. Upheld

The ASA welcomed Repsol’s assurance that the ad would be removed. The CAP Code stated that unqualified claims could mislead if material information was omitted.

The ad appeared within the FT’s digital energy newsletter and elsewhere on the FT website. It would therefore have been seen by both consumers, who may be interested in Repsol as a brand for the products and services they provide, and business readers, such as potential investors, partners and clients. We considered that both audiences would have an awareness that many companies in carbon-intensive industries, including the oil and gas sector, aimed to dramatically reduce their emissions in response to the climate crisis. In addition, both were increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of activities related to higher-carbon products and services, and would be interested in seeking out businesses, including oil and gas companies, who were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services, including towards achieving net zero emissions. However, we considered that consumers and many business readers were unlikely to be aware of the specific details of how companies planned to achieve this.

We considered that both consumers and business readers were likely to interpret the claim, “At Repsol, we are developing biofuels and synthetic fuels to achieve net zero emissions”, in addition to the imagery of nature and the natural environment, as meaning that Repsol’s development of biofuels and synthetic fuels formed a significant element of their current activities that were making meaningful progress towards achieving net zero emissions.

We acknowledged Repsol’s comments regarding their contribution to electrical charging, renewable generation capacity, and reductions in energy consumption and emissions in industrial centres in other facilities. However, notwithstanding current actions towards improving their environmental impact, we understood that a number of Repsol’s new biofuel and synthetic fuel initiatives were not yet in operation. Furthermore, Repsol’s carbon emissions stood at 171 million tonnes of CO2e in 2021 (50% of the emissions of the United Kingdom in 2021, 346.7 Mt CO2e). They produced approximately 600,000 barrels of oil per day. We also understood that Repsol had a substantial oil and gas exploration strategy, owning an interest in 40,660 acres (gross) of oil and gas development and exploration across Europe, Latin America, North America, Africa, and Asia and Oceania.

We acknowledged that Repsol’s hydrocarbons production focused on gas and understood the reasons for that. We also acknowledged that oil would continue to play a legitimate role in the context of energy transition in the future. However, we understood that their focus on the production of biofuels and synthetic fuels to achieve net zero emissions was a fraction of their business activities when compared to their substantial, ongoing, and expanding fossil fuel production. Furthermore, notwithstanding the reasons given for the continued production of oil and gas, we noted that the ad focused solely on an initiative the company suggested would deliver their net zero goal (with no timeframe given) when at the same time, Repsol was continuing to emit notable levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses and would do so for many years into the future.

We understood that consumers could access information about Repsol’s general business activities and plans on their website. However, further information to contextualise how and when Repsol would achieve net zero emissions, and the role that the development of biofuels would play in that plan, was material to consumers’ understanding of the ad’s overall message, and should have appeared in the ad itself.

We therefore concluded that the ad omitted material information and was misleading.

1. Repsol said that by adding the message “Find out more about this and other projects”, accompanied by a button with the message “More information” at the end of the ad, the reader was invited to click and access Repsol’s website. Once accessed, the website provided further information and news related to the company’s global activity. They believed that it was impossible to maintain the attractiveness of the ad and place more information within it.

Repsol explained that the ad was mainly designed for inclusion in the Financial Times (FT) digital energy newsletter sponsored by Repsol, aimed at an informed audience of users who subscribe to it and are interested in issues and news related to the energy sector. They acknowledged that the ad was also published elsewhere on the FT’s website.

Repsol said that they opened Spain’s first electric charging point, and operated Spain’s largest public electric vehicle charging network. In addition, they are a significant operator in the electricity and gas market in Spain, with 1.5 million customers. They currently have an installed renewable generation capacity of more than 1,800 MW worldwide and plan to reach 6,000 MW by 2025 and 20,000 MW by 2030. They produce an average of approximately 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which nearly 70% is gas. Their hydrocarbons production is focused on gas since the fuel helps transition from higher-emissions coal to electricity production, thus speeding up the energy transition. They further stated that oil will still be needed in a more decarbonized world, even according to the International Energy Agency’s most aggressive scenarios.

Repsol summarised that they have reduced energy consumption in their industrial centres by 20% in the period 2011-2022 and reduced emissions by more than 20% in all their facilities.

2. Repsol said they were aware that there is no single solution for sustainability. They explained that renewable fuels are one of the main elements in the company’s strategy to reach net zero by 2050. They aimed to reduce 55% of emissions from operated assets and 30% of net emissions by 2030. They also stated that they set a target for reducing their methane emissions intensity to 0.20% in 2025, which would be a reduction of 85%.

Repsol said that they will allocate more than €5 billion in organic investment and that 35% of these investments will be allocated to low-carbon technologies and projects. The company has implemented a methodology to determine whether a new investment is in line with its decarbonisation targets, and any investment proposed to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors must include a report prepared by their Sustainability Department. In the second half of 2023 they are introducing a new biofuels facility that will supply 250,000 tons per year of advanced biofuels. The use of these fuels will make it possible to avoid emissions of 900,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. They also are preparing to build synthetic fuels and urban waste recovery plants and have partnered with Enerkem to develop a plant which will process around 400,000 tons of non-recyclable municipal solid waste to produce around 240,000 tons of renewable methanol (biomethanol).

Repsol explained that renewable fuels make up 10% of their fuel sales in Spain and they expect to grow this aggressively. They have existing pilot projects in three cities which involve 100% biofuel pumps for fleet vehicles and have also launched a recent initiative to pay customers for their used cooking oil for incorporation into the processing of fatty residues. Repsol said they are committed to acting ethically and would remove the ad immediately.""" ;

a. The poster, seen in Bristol on 20 June 2022, featured large text that stated, “BRISTOL is READY for Cleaner Energy” superimposed over a cityscape shot of Bristol. The Shell logo (a red and yellow coloured shell) appeared in the top right-hand corner of the poster. Further text at the bottom of the poster stated, “In the South West 78,000 homes use 100% renewable electricity from Shell Energy” above smaller text that stated, “Shell Energy’s renewable electricity is supplied by the National Grid and certified by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin, matching electricity bought with the equivalent amount from 100% renewable sources”.

b. The TV ad, seen on 14 June 2022, opened with a man stating, “In the UK, 1.4 million households use 100% renewable electricity from Shell” as he helped a young child to cycle down the street. The scene that followed depicted two offshore engineers working on-site at a beach. The one facing the camera stated “Shell experts are working on a wind project that could power six million homes” as animated design plans for wind turbines popped up on the horizon. The ad then depicted an electric car driving into a rural town before its driver stated, “Nearly one in five new cars now plug in” as he plugged his car into a charging point. A woman out walking her dog then stated, “These chargers are popping up on our streets” before a man fitting an EV charging point added, “Shell aims to fit 50,000 chargers nationwide by 2025”. An employee at a Shell petrol and electric vehicle charging station then stated, “And with more electric car charge points coming to Shell forecourts near you, the UK is ready for Cleaner energy.” Throughout the ad, large individual letters appeared in the background of successive scenes to spell the word “READY”. The video ended with large on-screen text “The UK is READY for Cleaner Energy” followed by the Shell logo and the hashtag “#PoweringProgress”.

Superimposed text that appeared on-screen during the ad’s opening shots stated “Shell Energy’s renewable electricity is supplied by the National Grid and certified by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin, matching electricity bought with the equivalent amount from 100% renewable sources”.

c.

1. Upheld

The ASA acknowledged that consumers were likely to understand that energy products derived from fossil fuels were environmentally detrimental. We further acknowledged that many consumers would closely associate Shell with petrol sales, and more broadly understand that the company was involved in oil and gas investment and extraction. However, they would also have an awareness that many companies in carbon-intensive industries, including the oil and gas sector, aimed to dramatically reduce their emissions in response to the climate crisis. We considered that consumers were increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of activities related to higher-carbon products and services, and would be interested in seeking out businesses, including oil and gas companies, that were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services. However, they were unlikely to be aware of the details of this in relation to specific companies, and ads were therefore likely to mislead consumers if they misrepresented the contribution that lower-carbon initiatives played, or would play in the near future, as part of the overall balance of a company's activities. We assessed the ads on that basis.Ad (a) featured the claim “BRISTOL is READY for Cleaner Energy” in large text, which was accompanied by text at the bottom of the ad, that read “In the South-West 78,000 homes use 100% renewable electricity from Shell Energy”. The Shell logo appeared in the top right-hand corner of the poster. We acknowledged that the claims in the ad referred specifically to “Shell Energy”, as opposed to “Shell”, and referred to a single area of Shell’s business activities, namely those related to its role as a domestic electricity provider in the South-West of England. However, we did not consider that consumers would draw a distinction between “Shell” and “Shell Energy”, particularly because Shell was a brand well known for its energy products in a more general sense. We considered that the use of the Shell logo, the ad’s focus on the claim “BRISTOL is READY for Cleaner Energy” (emphasis on “READY”) and the other claim focusing on the number of existing customers meant that consumers would interpret the ad as making a broader claim about Shell as a whole providing cleaner energy, and featuring one illustrative example of Shell’s environmental credentials rather than as a narrow claim about one specific product offering. We considered the overall impression of the ad was that low-carbon energy products comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Shell invested in and sold in the UK in 2022, or were likely to do so in the near future.

Ads (b) and (c) depicted some of Shell’s business activities in 2022 and focused on more environmentally friendly energy products. The ads included the claims: “In the UK, 1.4 million households use 100% renewable electricity from Shell”; “Shell experts are working on a wind project that could power six million homes”; and “Shell aims to fit 50,000 [electric vehicle] chargers nationwide by 2025”. The claims “The UK is READY for cleaner energy” and hashtag “#PoweringProgress” appeared on-screen in the closing shots of the ads, together with the Shell logo and “Shell International”.

We considered that, in the absence of qualifying information, the cumulative effect of the claims relating to applications or sources of lower-carbon energy that spanned distinct and diverse areas of Shell’s operations, together with the claim “The UK is READY for Cleaner Energy”, which was immediately followed by the Shell logo, was to give the impression that low-carbon energy products comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Shell invested in and sold in the UK in 2022, or were likely to do so in the near future. In addition, the YouTube ad (c) included the caption “From electric vehicle charging to renewable electricity for your home, Shell is giving customers more low-carbon choices and helping drive the UK’s energy transition ...”. We considered the caption reinforced that impression.

We acknowledged Shell’s comment that, rather than being an explicit claim about Shell, the claim “The UK is READY for cleaner energy” in ads (b) and (c) was intended as a forward-looking statement about the UK-wide demand for less environmentally detrimental energy sources. However, in the context of the claim’s appearance in an ad for Shell, a well-known provider of energy products, we considered that consumers were likely to interpret the claim as being, in part, a claim about Shell’s own products and capacity to deliver low-carbon energy. We also considered that the emphasis the ads placed on “READY”, as well as the fact that the only timeframe mentioned by the ads was short-term, implied that lower-carbon energy products, like those shown in the ads, already comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Shell invested in and sold in the UK, or were likely to do so in the near future.

We acknowledged that “#PoweringProgress” in ad (c) referred to the name of Shell’s “Powering Progress” strategy through which the business aimed to achieve its target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. However, we considered that consumers were unlikely to recognise it as such. Instead, we considered that the claim reinforced the impression given by the ad’s preceding scenes that, not only was there immediate UK-wide demand for energy products that were less environmentally detrimental than those derived from fossil fuels, but that Shell’s business activities in 2022 were such that the company was already well-placed to meet that demand by providing “cleaner energy”, thereby “powering progress”.

We acknowledged that Shell said they were taking steps towards net zero and promoting sustainable energy. However, according to Shell’s 2021 Sustainability Report, Shell’s operations gave rise to greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 that were estimated as equivalent to 1375 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. While that estimate did not capture Shell’s absolute emissions in 2021, given that it included deductions linked to carbon offsets and did not cover certain commercial contracts, it nonetheless represented a large contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. We understood that large-scale oil and gas investment and extraction comprised the vast majority of the company’s business model in 2022 and would continue to do so in the near future. We therefore considered that, because ads (a), (b) and (c) gave the overall impression that a significant proportion of Shell’s business comprised lower-carbon energy products, further information about the proportion of Shell’s overall business model that comprised lower-carbon energy products was material information that should have been included. Because the ads did not include such information, we concluded that they omitted material information and were likely to mislead.

On this point, ads (a) and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 11.1 (Environmental claims) and ad (b) breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 and 3.2 (Misleading advertising) and 9.2 (Environmental claims).

2. Not upheld

The ASA noted that, since 2021, the UK Government had been conducting a review of ‘green’ electricity tariffs. That review was partly concerned with the question of whether Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) were adequate to ensure transparency regarding the provenance of the electricity associated with particular tariffs. Nevertheless, we understood that, at the time the ad appeared, the regulatory regime in the UK continued to allow domestic electricity providers to account for renewable energy supplied to consumers by holding REGOs, including by purchasing them via a third-party marketplace.

We understood the complainant was concerned that the claim “In the South West 78,000 homes use 100% renewable electricity from Shell Energy” in ad (a), and the claim “In the UK, 1.4 million households use 100% renewable electricity from Shell” in ads (b) and (c), misrepresented the number of homes in each region that purchased 100% renewable electricity from Shell Energy, and implied that Shell Energy directly supplied energy to the claimed number of homes in each region.

We considered that consumers would understand the claims to mean that the number of homes specified in each ad used electricity supplied under a domestic energy tariff by Shell, and that the electricity supplied was classed as 100% renewable. We understood that most electricity generated from renewable sources was distributed through the National Grid. The amount of electricity taken from the National Grid by consumers of renewable electricity products was equal to the amount of electricity fed into the National Grid from renewable sources.

The customer data that Shell had provided substantiated that the number of homes subscribed to their 100% renewable energy tariff in each region exceeded the claimed figure. Ofgem’s REGO certified that energy purchased via Shell’s 100% renewable electricity tariff was exclusively derived from renewable sources. For those reasons, we considered that the ads were not likely to mislead in relation to the number of households that purchased 100% renewable electricity from Shell.

Regarding how the electricity was supplied, each ad referred to the intermediacy of the National Grid with text that stated, “Shell Energy’s renewable electricity is supplied by the National Grid and certified by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin, matching electricity bought with the equivalent amount from 100% renewable sources”. In ads (b) and (c), that text featured on-screen for the entire duration of the ads’ opening shots. In ad (a), the text was included directly underneath the main claim. Because of the inclusion of this information, we did not consider that the ads implied that the electricity generated from renewable sources was delivered directly and only to Shell’s green energy tariff customers.

Because Shell had substantiated the claimed figures, and the ads made clear that the electricity was supplied via the National Grid rather than directly, we concluded that the ads were not likely to mislead.

On this point we investigated ads (a) and (c) under CAP Code rules 3.1, 3.3 and 3.7 (Misleading advertising) and 11.1 (Environmental claims), but did not find them in breach.

1. Shell UK Ltd stated that their intent with the ads was to raise consumer awareness of, and increase demand for, the range of lower emissions energy products and services they offered, the availability of which was increasing through continued investment. They believed that the ads accurately represented those products and services and did not omit material information about their more environmentally detrimental energy products, such as petrol. Consumers would already be well-informed regarding that aspect of their operations and, in fact, would primarily associate their brand with the sale of petrol. Recent market research conducted by an independent third-party company supported that 83% of consumers did so, and also suggested that a much smaller proportion were familiar with Shell’s lower-carbon energy products and services, including renewable electricity and electric vehicle (EV) charging. Shell hoped to bridge that gap in consumers’ knowledge by providing clear and accurate information about their newer products. Achieving that would be an essential step towards realising the business’s overarching aim of helping customers transition towards lower-emissions energy sources. Particularly because of their finding that petrol sales remained the most visible part of their brand to consumers, they believed that consumers were very unlikely to assume that the ads’ content covered the full range of Shell’s business activities. In line with that, they thought there was a low risk of the ads delivering the misleading impression that they were representative of the total environmental impact associated with Shell’s operations. Because the ads’ purpose was to promote low-carbon energy, they believed that any mention of high-carbon Shell products would have been counterproductive. Information about those Shell products would have only served to highlight their existence and availability, and thereby dilute the impact of the ads’ positive environmental message. In addition, it would be disproportionate and unworkable for regulators to require businesses with diverse product portfolios to ensure that ads, the primary purpose of which was usually to promote a specific range of products, always provided a representative overview of the advertiser’s business as a whole.

Shell explained that, through use of the hashtag “#PoweringProgress”, ads (b) and (c) called attention to Shell’s Powering Progress strategy, which was central to their objective of playing a leading role in helping society meet the challenges of climate change. As part of that strategy, Shell’s commitment in relation to their own operations was to become a net-zero energy business by 2050. In addition, they aimed to expand on the 13,000 EV charging points they provided in 2022 by increasing that number to 100,000 by 2030. They emphasised that the achievement of such aims would be heavily contingent on improving consumers’ awareness of their less environmentally detrimental energy products.

Shell neither believed that the ads misrepresented the overall environmental impact of their business activities, nor that the ads omitted significant information about that impact. They highlighted that ad (a) gave specific information about the number of Shell Energy customers in Bristol who received renewable electricity. On that basis, they believed consumers were unlikely to view it as relevant to the total environmental impact associated with the full range of Shell’s business activities. They stated that ad (a) was instead likely to deliver the narrower impression that the carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the renewable energy Shell provided to 78,000 homes in Bristol were lower than the emissions associated with the average UK fuel mix (i.e., a mix which incorporated fossil fuels). They also stated that consumers would likely understand that the ad only went so far as to position Shell’s renewable electricity sales as part of a strategy to aid customers’ transition away from higher-emissions products.

Shell also believed that consumers were unlikely to regard the selection of environmentally motivated initiatives referred to and championed in ads (b) and (c) as a representative sample of the full range of Shell’s business activities. Not only would consumers have recognised that those ads did not mention Shell’s high-carbon products such as petrol, but they were also unlikely to regard the set of initiatives depicted as having a wide enough scope to comprise anything resembling a representative cross-section of Shell’s business model. In particular, they would note that the ads’ content was solely focused on the delivery of electricity to UK consumers, and understand that Shell’s activities in that regard constituted a relatively minor part of their overall business. In line with that, they believed consumers were unlikely to infer that the ad intended to send any message whatsoever regarding the overall environmental impact or balance of Shell’s operations. Instead, they stated that consumers would interpret the ads as merely emphasising that Shell Energy supplied renewable electricity to UK homes, that Shell was involved in the development of offshore windfarms, and that, in line with their aim to increase potential EV purchasers’ confidence in the availability of chargers, Shell was in the process of rapidly expanding its existing EV charging infrastructure. Consumers would understand that such activities were consistent with Shell’s overarching environmental aims.

Shell stated that the claim “BRISTOL IS READY FOR CLEANER ENERGY” in ad (a), as well as the similar claim “THE UK IS READY FOR CLEANER ENERGY” in ads (b) and (c), would be recognised as a forward looking statement regarding the potential of certain Shell products to provide consumers with energy that contributed lower greenhouse gas emissions than energy from non-renewable sources. They emphasised their view that neither the claims themselves, nor the ads as a whole, featured anything to imply Shell exclusively or predominantly supplied renewable or low emissions energy. Instead, the ads merely highlighted that Shell already supplied lower-carbon energy products to some UK consumers.

Clearcast, responding in relation to the TV ad (b) only, believed that the ad did not misrepresent the overall environmental impact of Shell’s operations by stating or implying that impact was not negative. That was because ad (b) made clear that it did not seek to provide a holistic view of Shell’s environmental impact in 2022. Instead, the ad gave an overview of environmentally motivated initiatives running in areas of Shell’s business that were specifically concerned with the generation and supply of low-carbon electricity, while inviting consumers to transition towards less environmentally detrimental energy sources. They understood the tagline “The UK is ready for cleaner energy” as referring to a society-wide appetite for less environmentally detrimental energy products, and further stated that it did not emphasise or explicitly relate to Shell’s overall impact, nor even to any environmental benefits of the initiatives featured in ad (b). In addition, the claim “Nearly one in five new cars now plug in” drew focus to the important role that individual consumers’ behavioural changes would play in the fight against climate change. On that basis, they believed the claim suggested there was a limit to what Shell could achieve without consumers’ co-operation. They supported Shell’s view that consumers’ awareness of Shell’s petrol sales would mitigate any risk of ad (b) delivering the misleading impression that it was representative of the overall environmental impact of Shell’s business activities. In particular, ad (b)’s reference to, and visuals depicting, a Shell “forecourt” would specifically bring the company’s fossil-fuel based energy products to mind.

2. Shell said that the claim in ad (a) and the similar claims in ads (b) and (c) were substantiated by customer data they provided. They also believed that the qualifying text in each ad, “Shell Energy’s renewable electricity is supplied by the National Grid and certified by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin, matching electricity bought with the equivalent amount from 100% renewable sources” was prominent enough to make the intermediacy of the National Grid clear. On that basis, the ads did not suggest that Shell’s renewable energy was supplied to customers directly.

Shell believed that the claim in ad (a), “In the South West 78,000 homes use 100% renewable electricity from Shell Energy”, gave the impression that 78,000 homes in the South West of England purchased 100% renewable electricity from Shell Energy. The qualifying text made the intermediacy of the National Grid clear, meaning the ad gave the overall impression that, while electricity was supplied by the National Grid, the energy consumed by the claimed number of homes was accounted for by an equivalent amount of exclusively renewable energy that Shell Energy purchased.

Shell said that the claim in ads (b) and (c), “In the UK, 1.4 million households use 100% renewable electricity from Shell” gave the impression that 1.4 million homes across the UK were subscribed to Shell’s 100% renewable energy tariff. Because the qualifying text made the intermediacy of the National Grid clear, viewers would not have the misleading impression that Shell Energy supplied energy directly to those customers.

The customer data indicated that, in April 2022, in the South West of England 78,507 households were subscribed to Shell Energy’s 100% renewable electricity tariff. It also indicated that 1,403,357 households across the UK were subscribed to the same tariff. Every unit of the electricity provided to those customers was certified as renewable by the electricity and gas regulator Ofgem’s Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs).

In relation to the TV ad (b) only, Clearcast supported Shell’s response on this point.""" ;

Their projections were also consistent with, and at least as skillful as, those of independent academic and government models.

Many of the uncovered fossil fuel industry documents include explicit projections of the amount of warming expected to occur over time in response to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Yet, these numerical and graphical data have received little attention. Indeed, no one has systematically reviewed climate modeling projections by any fossil fuel interest. What exactly did oil and gas companies know, and how accurate did their knowledge prove to be? Here, we address these questions by reporting and analyzing all known global warming projections documented by—and in many cases modeled by—Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003.
Our results show that in private and academic circles since the late 1970s and early 1980s, ExxonMobil predicted global warming correctly and skillfully. Using established statistical techniques, we find that 63 to 83% of the climate projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists were accurate in predicting subsequent global warming. ExxonMobil’s average projected warming was 0.20° ± 0.04°C per decade, which is, within uncertainty, the same as that of independent academic and government projections published between 1970 and 2007. The average “skill score” and level of uncertainty of ExxonMobil’s climate models (67 to 75% and ±21%, respectively) were also similar to those of the independent models.
Moreover, we show that ExxonMobil scientists correctly dismissed the possibility of a coming ice age in favor of a “carbon dioxide induced ‘super-interglacial’”; accurately predicted that human-caused global warming would first be detectable in the year 2000 ± 5; and reasonably estimated how much CO2 would lead to dangerous warming.""" ,

Overall, ExxonMobil’s global warming projections closely track subsequent observed temperature increases.
Figure 1Opens in image viewer reproduces all 12 identified unique graphs, which contain 15 of the 16 identified temperature projections (the 16th was reported as a table). For example, panel 3 of Fig. 1Opens in image viewer is a graph showing “an estimate of the average global temperature increase” under the “Exxon 21st Century Study–High Growth scenario” for CO2. It was included in a 1982 internal briefing on the “CO2 ‘Greenhouse’ Effect” prepared by Exxon Research and Engineering Company and circulated widely to Exxon management (36). The briefing was labeled as “proprietary information for authorized company use only.” The graph appeared a second time in an Exxon manager’s presentation on “CO2 greenhouse and climate issues” at an internal company environmental conference in 1984 (37).

Fig. 2. Summary of all global warming projections (nominal scenarios) reported by ExxonMobil scientists in internal documents and peer-reviewed publications (gray lines), superimposed on historically observed temperature change (red).
Solid gray lines (and asterisked numerical labels) indicate global warming projections modeled by ExxonMobil scientists themselves; dashed gray lines indicate projections internally reproduced by ExxonMobil scientists from third-party sources. Shades of gray and numerical labels scale with model start dates, from earliest (1977: lightest, “1”) to latest (2003: darkest, “12”). Numerical labels correspond to panels in Fig. 1Opens in image viewer, which displays all original graphical projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists. Observations reflect the smoothed annual average of five historical time series. For data sources and plotting details, see SM sections S1 and S2.
Panel 3 of Fig. 1Opens in image viewer displays one of 12 unique temperature projections (out of a total of 16 projections) that were output by models built or run in-house by ExxonMobil scientists (the 12 projections are indicated by asterisks in Figs. 1Opens in image viewer to 3Opens in image viewer and Table 1Opens in image viewer). To our knowledge, the temperature projection in panel 3 was independently produced by Exxon scientists as part of “technology forecasting activities in 1981” operated by the company’s Corporate Planning Department (37). The temperature projection was based on “calculations” of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations “recently completed at Exxon Research and Engineering Company” (36). The remaining 11 temperature projections were produced by models developed by ExxonMobil scientists in collaboration with academic coauthors. Specifically, the seven unique temperature projections shown in panels 5 to 7b in Fig. 1Opens in image viewer derived from a one-dimensional upwelling-diffusion Energy Balance Model to study how the “climatic transient response from fossil fuel burning is damped…by heat storage in the world’s oceans…” (38). The Exxon scientist leading the collaboration internally described their climate modeling as “sophisticated” and “state of the art” (39). The remaining four unique temperature projections (three in panels 8, 11, and 12 in Fig. 1Opens in image viewer and the fourth designated by “9” in Fig. 2Opens in image viewer) were generated by an “Integrated Science Model which consists of coupled modules for carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry of other trace gases, radiative forcing by greenhouse gases, energy balance model for global temperature, and a model for sea level response” (40).""" ,

. How ExxonMobil Corp exaggerated the uncertainties of climate science and modeling
• In 2000, ExxonMobil Corp CEO Lee Raymond wrote that “[W]e do not now have a sufficient scientific understanding of climate change to make reasonable predictions and/or justify drastic measures...the science of climate change is uncertain….” (76). The report speculated about a “natural period of warming,” “solar activity,” and “[v]olcanic eruptions, El Nino.” “With all this natural climate ‘noise’ and the complexities of measurement,” it said, “science is not now able to confirm that fossil fuel use has led to any significant global warming.”

• In 2001, an ExxonMobil Corp press release said: “[T]here is no consensus about long-term climate trends and what causes them...during the 1970’s [sic], people were concerned about global cooling” (82).
• In 2003, US Senator James Inhofe, who has to date received $2.3 million in campaign contributions from oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, argued that the issue of human-caused global warming “is far from settled” by pointing to “those who warned us in the 1970s that the planet was headed for a catastrophic global cooling” (56, 83–85).
• In 2004, a report published by the ExxonMobil Corp-funded Cato Institute stated that “Thirty years ago there was much scientific discussion among those who believed that humans influenced the…reflectivity [which would] cool the earth, more than…increasing carbon dioxide, causing warming. Back then, the ‘coolers’ had the upper hand…But nature quickly shifted gears…Needless to say, the abrupt shift in the climate caused almost as abrupt a shift in the balance of scientists who predictably followed the temperature” (56, 86).""" ,

Several of the documents in question include explicit projections of the amount of warming that could be expected to occur over time in response to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Yet, whereas the text of these documents has been interrogated in detail, the numerical and graphical data in them have not. Indeed, no one has systematically reported climate modeling projections by any fossil fuel interest, let alone assessed their accuracy and skill. This contrasts with academic climate models, whose performance has been extensively scrutinized (16–24).
In this Review, we report and analyze all known projections of global mean surface temperature (hereafter “temperature”) change reported by company scientists working for Exxon and/or for ExxonMobil Corp after Exxon’s merger with Mobil Oil Corp in 1999. (Hereafter, we collectively refer to Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp as “ExxonMobil” or the “company.”) Some projections resulted from models built or run in-house by ExxonMobil scientists, sometimes in collaboration with independent researchers. Others were produced by third parties and then discussed by ExxonMobil scientists in internal reports. Where relevant, we distinguish these provenances, but otherwise we collectively refer to these projections as “reported” by ExxonMobil scientists.
We test the accuracy and modeling skill of ExxonMobil’s global warming projections by retrospectively comparing them against subsequent observed temperature changes. We also compare their performance against assessments of models published in independent scientific literature. [Here and throughout, we use the term “climate models” to generically refer to computer simulations of Earth’s climate system. All of the models investigated here—both from ExxonMobil and from independent academic and government scientists—are variants of Energy Balance Models, rather than the higher-resolution, more comprehensive General Circulation Models that succeeded them in the late 1980s (25–27).] Having quantified ExxonMobil’s early understanding of climate science, we contrast it with public claims made by the company and its allies. We then offer three illustrations of how quantitative historical analysis of the fossil fuel industry’s documents can yield further historical insights into the disconnect between its private understanding of climate science and its public climate denial.
We focus on global mean surface temperature changes because they are a primary driver of climate impacts, are central to climate policy-making, are the most common output of early climate models, and are accurately captured by observational records. We limit our analysis to global warming projections reported by scientists at ExxonMobil, as compared to other companies, for several reasons. First, ExxonMobil’s extensive climate research program is well documented. Second, ExxonMobil documents contain the largest public collection of global warming projections recorded by a single company, allowing us to develop a coherent picture of the early understanding of climate science by a specific industry actor. Third, the company has been active in challenging climate science in general and climate models specifically, such that its work on the matter may be of particular interest to researchers, reporters, advocates, shareholders, fund managers, politicians, and legal investigators examining corporate responsibility for climate change (Box 1).""" ,

A second insight involves ExxonMobil’s predictions as to when anthropogenic global warming would be discernible against the backdrop of natural climate fluctuations. Ten internal reports and one peer-reviewed publication spanning 1979–1985 offered quantitative estimates, with a median year of 2000 ± 5. (For each document, we infer the predicted year from its corresponding supporting quotations, summarized in table S4; see SM section S1.2.6 for method details.) This is consistent with what in fact occurred. In 1995, the IPCC declared that a human effect on global temperatures had been detected, a conclusion they reiterated with higher confidence in 2000 and in all subsequent IPCC assessment reports (57, 58). In other words, ExxonMobil’s understanding of climate science was sufficient not only to project long-term warming accurately but also to predict when it would be discernible. Yet, ExxonMobil publicly asserted that the science was too uncertain to know when—or if—human-caused global warming might be measurable. In 2004, for example, they stated that “scientific uncertainties continue to limit our ability to make objective, quantitative determinations regarding the human role in recent climate change,” a claim that was contrary to the analysis of their own scientists (59).
Staying silent on stranded assets
A third insight concerns the “carbon budget”—the amount of CO2 that can be added to the atmosphere—while holding anthropogenic global warming below 2°C. Five ExxonMobil studies published between 1982 and 2005 address the question. They conclude that to stabilize CO2 concentrations below 550 ppm and/or limit warming to 2°C would impose a carbon budget of 251 to 716 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC) between 2015 and 2100 (10). For comparison, recent calculations have narrowed the uncertainty and place the figure at 442 to 651 GtC (60). Thus, ExxonMobil’s calculations of the carbon budget were consistent with today’s best estimates. Yet, to our knowledge, ExxonMobil did not alert investors, consumers, or the general public to this constraint.""" ,

ExxonMobil has often specifically claimed or suggested in public that climate models are “unreliable” (51). In 1999, for example, ExxonMobil Corp’s chief executive officer (CEO) Lee Raymond said future climate “projections are based on completely unproven climate models, or, more often, sheer speculation.” (2) In 2013, his successor, Rex Tillerson, called climate models “not competent” (52). In 2015, he stated: “We do not really know what the climate effects of 600 ppm versus 450 ppm will be because the models simply are not that good” (53). The company’s own modeling contradicts such statements. Exxon’s 1982 projection shown in Fig. 1Opens in image viewer (panel 3), for example, suggests that 600 ppm of atmospheric CO2 would lead to 1.3°C more global warming than 450 ppm.""" ,
                                                                                                                 """In 2015, investigative journalists uncovered internal company documents showing that Exxon scientists have been warning their executives about “potentially catastrophic” anthropogenic (human-caused) global warming since at least 1977 (1, 2). Researchers and journalists have subsequently unearthed additional documents showing that the US oil and gas industry writ large—by way of its trade association, the American Petroleum Institute—has been aware of potential human-caused global warming since at least the 1950s (3); the coal industry since at least the 1960s (4); electric utilities, Total oil company, and General Motors and Ford motor companies since at least the 1970s (5–8); and Shell oil company since at least the 1980s (9).
This corpus of fossil fuel documents has attracted widespread scholarly, journalistic, political, and legal attention, leading to the conclusion that the fossil fuel industry has known for decades that their products could cause dangerous global warming. In 2017, we used content analysis to demonstrate that Exxon’s internal documents, as well as peer-reviewed studies authored or coauthored by Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists, overwhelmingly acknowledged that global warming is real and human-caused (10). By contrast, we found that the majority of Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp’s public communications promoted doubt on the matter. Cities, counties, and states have accordingly filed dozens of lawsuits variously accusing ExxonMobil Corp and other companies of deceit and responsibility for climate damages (11). The attorney general of Massachusetts, for instance, alleges that ExxonMobil has had a “long-standing internal scientific knowledge of the causes and consequences of climate change” and waged “public deception campaigns” that misrepresented that knowledge (12). Civil society campaigns seeking to hold fossil fuel interests accountable for allegedly misleading shareholders, customers, and the public about climate science have emerged under monikers such as #ExxonKnew, #ShellKnew, and #TotalKnew (13–15) (see Box 1 for more examples).""" ,

Table 1. Skill scores of global warming projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists in internal documents and peer-reviewed publications.
Scores are shown for (
) temperature change versus time; and (
) temperature change versus change in radiative forcing (“implied TCR”). Average skill scores are summarized for (i) all projections and (ii) projections modeled by ExxonMobil scientists themselves (indicated by asterisks). A skill score of 100% indicates perfect agreement with observations; a score less than zero indicates worse performance than a zero temperature change null hypothesis. For each projection, median scores and 5th and 95th percentile confidence intervals are shown, all as percentages. For each average skill score, the mean and the 1σ standard error of the mean are shown. Confidence intervals for projections over short periods—such as Kheshgi et al. (1997), Albritton et al. (2001), and Kheshgi and Jain (2003)—are large, primarily owing to the substantial impact of interannual and subdecadal variability on short-term temperature trends.
In Fig. 3AOpens in image viewer, we compare trends in temperature change versus time for historical observations (in red) and for all 16 projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists (in gray or black). Over the course of their respective projection periods (indicated in blue boxes at the top of each panel in Fig. 3Opens in image viewer), the average predicted warming was 0.20° ± 0.04°C per decade. Ten of the 16 projections are consistent with historical observations (differences between models and projections are shown in fig. S1A). Of the remaining six projections, two forecast more warming than observed and four forecast less. Treating each unique graph and table—rather than each forcing scenario—as independent, 10 out of the 12 unique projection datasets are consistent with observations. Of the remainder, one forecasts more warming than observed and one forecasts less. Notably, these two projections are among the only three (out of 12) that were reported without uncertainty bars. They therefore have less “room for uncertainty” in our consistency tests. Overall, the models perform very well.
When we account for mismatches between forecast and observed forcings by using the iTCR metric, 12 of the 16 projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists are consistent with observations. Figure 3BOpens in image viewer uses the iTCR metric to compare trends in observed and projected iTCRs, and fig. S1B shows their differences. Treating each unique graph and table as independent, 9 out of 12 datasets are consistent. The three outliers forecast more warming than observed; two of them do not have uncertainty bars.
We also calculate skill scores for the temperature-versus-time and iTCR metrics (Table 1Opens in image viewer). A skill score of 100% indicates perfect agreement between projections and observations; a score between zero and 100% indicates some degree of skill; and a score less than zero indicates a performance worse than a zero-change null hypothesis (16, 20).
With respect to temperature change versus time, we find the average of the median skill scores of all 16 reported projections to be 67 ± 7%. Across projections modeled by ExxonMobil scientists themselves, it is 72 ± 6%. These scores indicate highly skillful predictions. The highest-scoring projection was a 1985 peer-reviewed publication [Hoffert and Flannery (1985, nominal CO2 scenario)], with a skill score of 99% (38). The 1982/1984 projection discussed earlier (Fig. 1Opens in image viewer, panel 3) has a skill score of 82% [although it marginally failed the consistency test (Fig. 3Opens in image viewer and fig. S1)]. Only three of the 16 projections have skill scores below 50%. For comparison, NASA scientist James Hansen’s global warming predictions presented to the US Congress in 1988 have been found to have skill scores ranging from 38 to 66% across the three different forcing scenarios that he reported (16, 20).
Using the iTCR metric, the average skill of the 16 projections is 67 ± 9%. Among projections modeled by ExxonMobil scientists themselves, it is 75 ± 5%. Seven projections score 85% or above. Hoffert and Flannery (1985, high CO2 scenario) is again the highest scorer (92%), closely followed by two projections scoring 90%, which are featured in three internal reports in 1982/1984 and 1985, respectively (38, 39, 41, 42). Only four projections have skill scores below 50% for the iTCR metric. Again, for comparison, Hansen’s 1988 projections had skill scores in terms of the iTCR metric ranging from 28 to 81% (16).
We can compare these metrics with Hausfather et al. (2020), who calculated the average skill scores of 18 academic and government climate model projections published between 1970 and 2007. They obtained a value of 69% for both temperature-versus-time and iTCR metrics (16). On average, therefore, global warming projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists were as skillful as those of independent scientists of their day, and their own models were especially skillful. (As described earlier, ExxonMobil scientists did not simply rerun existing models; they developed their own models, typically in collaboration with academic coauthors, which independently corroborated the findings of other climate scientists.) To the extent that these projections represented contemporary knowledge of the likely effects of fossil fuel burning on global temperature, we can conclude that Exxon knew as much in the 1970–1990s as academic and government scientists knew. The average warming projected by the 18 academic and government models was 0.19° ± 0.03°C per decade, which is, within uncertainty, the same as ExxonMobil’s average of 0.20° ± 0.04°C per decade.
We note that 2 of the 18 projections analyzed by Hausfather et al. (2020) are among those reported by ExxonMobil scientists. However, excluding these two projections has negligible effect on the average warming predicted by ExxonMobil or on the average skill scores of all ExxonMobil projections with respect to both temperature change versus time and iTCR (see sensitivity analyses, SM section S1.2.5 and table S1). Our conclusions also hold true when considering only the 12 (of 16) temperature projections from models built or run in-house by ExxonMobil scientists, indicated by asterisks in Figs. 1Opens in image viewer to 3Opens in image viewer and Table 1Opens in image viewer (see SM section S1.2.5 and table S1).
In summary, climate projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists between 1977 and 2003 were accurate and skillful in predicting subsequent global warming. Some projections suggested slightly too much warming and others not quite enough, but most (63 to 83%, depending on the metric used) were statistically consistent with subsequently observed temperatures, particularly after accounting for discrepancies between projected and observed changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. ExxonMobil’s projections were also consistent with, and as skillful as, those of academic and government scientists. All told, ExxonMobil was aware of contemporary climate science, contributed to that science, and predicted future global warming correctly. These findings corroborate and add quantitative precision to assertions by scholars, journalists, lawyers, politicians, and others that ExxonMobil accurately foresaw the threat of human-caused global warming, both prior and parallel to orchestrating lobbying and propaganda campaigns to delay climate action (1, 2, 10, 11, 13, 43–48), and refute claims by ExxonMobil Corp and its defenders that these assertions are incorrect (49).""" ,

We analyzed 32 internal documents produced in-house by ExxonMobil scientists and managers between 1977 and 2002, and 72 peer-reviewed scientific publications authored or coauthored by ExxonMobil scientists between 1982 and 2014. The internal documents were collated from public archives provided by ExxonMobil Corp (28), InsideClimate News (29), and Climate Investigations Center (30). The peer-reviewed publications were obtained by identifying all peer-reviewed documents among ExxonMobil Corp’s lists of “Contributed Publications,” except for three articles discovered independently during our research (31) [see supplementary materials (SM) section S2 for details on the assembly of the corpus]. These constitute all publicly available internal ExxonMobil documents concerning anthropogenic global warming of which we are aware, and all ExxonMobil peer-reviewed publications concerning global warming disclosed by the company.
Using manual content analysis, we identify all documents that reported climate model outputs of (i) a time series of projected future temperature, and (ii) future external radiative forcings [including at least atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration] (see SM section S1.1 for coding details). For models driven by more than one forcing time series (i.e., for high- and low-CO2 scenarios as well as a central, “nominal” one), each resulting temperature time series is treated as a separate and individual projection. Our figures and tables therefore distinguish between “nominal,” “high,” and “low” model projections. By contrast, for a given CO2 scenario, temperature time series accompanied by uncertainty bars (corresponding, for example, to different model climate sensitivities) are treated as single projections with uncertainty bounds given by those uncertainty bars. This yields 12 documents published between 1977 and 2003, which contain 16 distinct temperature projections presented in the form of 12 unique graphs and one table (summarized in SM section S2.2). The 12 documents comprise seven internal memos (1977 to 1985) and five peer-reviewed papers (1985 to 2003). Twelve of the 16 temperature projections came from models built or run in-house by ExxonMobil scientists, typically in collaboration with independent researchers.

Mythologizing global cooling
Panel 1b of Fig. 1Opens in image viewer is a graph of the global warming “effect of CO2 on an interglacial scale” originally published by climate scientist J. Murray Mitchell Jr. in March 1977 and reproduced by Exxon scientist James Black in a private briefing to the Exxon Corporation Management Committee 4 months later (54, 55). This dataset was not included in our preceding analysis because its long time scale does not permit accurate digitization of its projected post-industrial anthropogenic global warming. Nonetheless, overlaying the original graph with the temperatures simulated by a modern Earth system model (in red) shows that Exxon scientists were accurate in warning their superiors of the prospect of a “carbon dioxide induced ‘super-interglacial,’” as Mitchell Jr. termed it, that would render Earth hotter than at any time in at least 150,000 years (56). This shows that Exxon scientists correctly sided with the majority of the peer-reviewed literature in the 1970s that foresaw human-caused global warming overwhelming any possibility of global cooling and a (natural) ice age. [According to Peterson et al. (2008), only ~14% of the peer-reviewed literature between 1965 and 1977 anticipated global cooling (56).] It also shows that “the myth of the 1970s global cooling scientific consensus” cultivated in public by Mobil in the 1990s and ExxonMobil Corp in the 2000s (see Box 3) was false and contradicted the conclusion of their own scientists that global cooling was unlikely (56).""" ,

The substantial body of literature documenting the history of climate lobbying and propaganda by fossil fuel interests has been described as a “vast blind spot” of major climate assessments—ignored, in particular, in all but the most recent IPCC assessment report (61–63). Yet bringing quantitative techniques from the physical sciences to bear on a discipline traditionally dominated by qualitative journalistic and historical approaches offers one path to remedying this blind spot. Here, it has enabled us to conclude with precision that, decades ago, ExxonMobil understood as much about climate change as did academic and government scientists. Our analysis shows that, in private and academic circles since the late 1970s and early 1980s, ExxonMobil scientists (i) accurately projected and skillfully modeled global warming due to fossil fuel burning; (ii) correctly dismissed the possibility of a coming ice age; (iii) accurately predicted when human-caused global warming would first be detected; and (iv) reasonably estimated how much CO2 would lead to dangerous warming. Yet, whereas academic and government scientists worked to communicate what they knew to the public, ExxonMobil worked to deny it.""" ,

BACKGROUND
In 2015, investigative journalists discovered internal company memos indicating that Exxon oil company has known since the late 1970s that its fossil fuel products could lead to global warming with “dramatic environmental effects before the year 2050.” Additional documents then emerged showing that the US oil and gas industry’s largest trade association had likewise known since at least the 1950s, as had the coal industry since at least the 1960s, and electric utilities, Total oil company, and GM and Ford motor companies since at least the 1970s. Scholars and journalists have analyzed the texts contained in these documents, providing qualitative accounts of fossil fuel interests’ knowledge of climate science and its implications. In 2017, for instance, we demonstrated that Exxon’s internal documents, as well as peer-reviewed studies published by Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists, overwhelmingly acknowledged that climate change is real and human-caused. By contrast, the majority of Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp’s public communications promoted doubt on the matter.""" ,
                                                                                                                 """We assess each model projection over the period from the publication year of its containing document through 2019 (or through the final projected year, if earlier). First, we overlay all original temperature time series with observed temperature changes. Observations are aligned with respect to the earliest reference year(s) for which model projection data are available and, unless noted otherwise, reflect the smoothed annual average of five historical time series. Following Hausfather et al. (2020) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we compare observations to model projections in two quantitative ways: (i) change in temperature versus time; and (ii) change in temperature versus change in radiative forcing (the “implied transient climate response,” or iTCR) (16, 24). The iTCR metric enables us to assess model performance while accounting for any differences in the assumptions about future radiative forcings driving the models. For each projected and observed temperature time series, per-decade temperature changes are calculated by fitting an ordinary least squares model over the projection period and multiplying the resulting gradient coefficient by 10. Analogously, iTCR is calculated by regressing temperature against anthropogenic radiative forcing over the projection period and multiplying the result by the forcing associated with doubled atmospheric CO2 concentrations,

In the real world, of course, global temperature changes are driven by multiple natural and anthropogenic factors, including but not limited to CO2. Nevertheless, even when model projections are driven by CO2-only anthropogenic forcing scenarios, retrospectively comparing projections to observations offers a robust, independent, and established test of model skill. This is because (i) global warming has been almost entirely human-caused since the late 19th century (32, 33) and (ii) total anthropogenic forcing over the past 150 years has been, to first order, similar to the forcing of CO2 alone, because the warming effects of other greenhouse gases and the cooling effects of other sources cancel one another out (34).

 values, meanwhile, were based on a 1000-member ensemble of observationally informed forcing estimates reported by Dessler and Forster (2018) (35).
Evaluated in terms of each of the above metrics, we deem model projections and historical observations to be consistent if and only if the 95% confidence intervals of the differences between the two include zero. As detailed in SM sections S1.2.2 and S1.2.3, these confidence intervals were calculated to reflect two sources of uncertainty: (i) statistical uncertainty in regression coefficients and (ii) structural uncertainty due to different model climate sensitivities, as and when indicated by error bars in projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists.
As an additional measure of performance, we calculate the “skill score” of each model by comparing the root-mean-squared errors of a model projection with those of a zero temperature change null hypothesis (20). For each projection, we calculate skill scores with respect to (i) each of the five observational temperature records for the temperature-versus-time metric and (ii) the 5000 estimates of

Emphasizing uncertainties
It has been established that, for many years, Exxon’s public affairs strategy was—as a 1988 internal memo put it—to “emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions regarding the potential enhanced greenhouse effect” (10, 44, 50). However, our analysis shows that in their reports and briefings to management, ExxonMobil’s own scientists did not particularly emphasize uncertainty; on the contrary, the level of uncertainty indicated by their global warming projections (bootstrapped 2σ standard error of the mean = ±21%) was commensurate with that reported by independent academics (±16%). Crucially, it excluded the possibility of no anthropogenic global warming; at no point did company scientists suggest that human-caused global warming would not occur. Nor did they conclude that the uncertainties were too great to permit differentiation of human and natural drivers. Yet publicly, ExxonMobil Corp made these claims until at least the early 2010s (see Box 2).""" ;

 Susan Lahey October 3, 2023

An Austrian court ruled that Austrian Airlines AG misled the public last year when it published ads offering CO2-neutral flights that used 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), between Vienna and Venice.

The greenwashing case was brought by Austria’s Association for Consumer Information (VKI). The ruling ordered the airline to publish information about the case on its social media.

Sustainable aviation fuel is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry, which currently accounts for 2-3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. SAF is generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, providing substantial emissions reductions relative to current fossil-based jet fuels. Currently, however, SAF represents only around 0.1% of the fuel used in aviation globally today according to the International Energy Agency.

According to the ruling, Austrian Airlines gave a false impression through advertising statements such as “Fly CO2-neutral with us,” or “100% SAF.”  Marketed for flights between Vienna and Venice, the campaign allowed consumers to pay a surcharge in excess of 50% of the ticket price for the CO2-neutral option, with the airline purchasing SAF to be added to future flights.

In its complaint, VKI noted that the maximum proportion of SAF was actually 5%, and that it is not currently possible to operate 100% SAF flights.

VKI lawyer Barbara Bauer said:

“In principle, we welcome all corporate efforts that serve to protect the environment. But promoting flights as CO2-neutral when this is not technically possible and it cannot even be ensured that sustainable aviation fuel is used in the specific flight is definitely going too far. The fact that consumers have to pay a hefty surcharge for this dubious service is a special treat of this marketing strategy.”

The case marked the latest in a series of greenwashing challenges for airlines. Austrian Airlines is a subsidiary of Lufthansa which was also found to have misled consumers through greenwashing earlier this year. UK regulator Advertising Standards Authority said that Lufthansa’s ads inaccurately insinuated that the airline “had taken significant mitigating steps to ensure that the net environmental impact of their business was not harmful.”

Additionally, BEUC, the European Consumer Organization, has filed a complaint against 17 EU airlines, including Austrian, for misleading climate-related claims. This includes claims that customers can pay extra credits to offset the CO2 emissions of the flight; charging flyers more and claiming that the extra cost contributes to the development of SAFs; or implying that air travel can be sustainable.""" ;

Big Oil hasn’t been shy about exploiting its university-research connections to “green” its public image. In an eight-page magazine spread, Chevron proudly proclaims: “We’re partnering with major universities to develop the next generation of biofuels.” In another ad, BP declared: “It’s time to invest in our own backyard… we’re investing $500 million over the next 10 years to establish the Energy Biosciences Institute”—a reference to the alliance, headquartered at U.C. Berkeley, that DOE secretaries Chu and Koonin helped to negotiate.

The boldest of these ads appeared on the influential opinion pages of the New York Times. The ad touted Stanford University’s research partnership with Exxon Mobil, among other companies, through the Global Climate and Energy Project—a deal signed in 2002 that is still ongoing today (and is reviewed in this report). The ad—bearing the official Stanford University seal side by side with the GCEP logo—deeply angered many faculty and students on campus because their perception of that ad strongly suggested that the scientific evidence regarding global climate change was still not conclusive. In addition to bearing the university’s official seal, the ad was signed by Stanford Professor Lynn Orr, then-director of the Exxon-funded GCEP alliance""" ,
                               """Implications
The 10 university-industry agreements reviewed for this report reveal a considerable amount about the goals and expectations of the big energy companies as well as the research conditions and constraints that academic researchers at U.S. universities are now operating under as a condition of their acceptance of this private industry financing.

Our review found that the terms and conditions outlined in these 10 agreements do not always show parity between the two sets of research partners. Indeed, the report’s analysis supports the author’s view that, in fundamental respects, the vast majority of these contracts seriously challenge the historic research integrity and the independence of the universities involved.

In the recent past, private industry (through Bell Labs and numerous other corporate research hubs) conducted a substantial amount of scientific research and technological development. Over the past 30 years, however, many private companies have vastly reduced their R&D investments, and downsized or outright eliminated their own inhouse scientific and technological expertise. What research these companies do continue to fund is increasingly contracted out to third parties, including private contract research labs and U.S. universities. This is not true of all firms, of course, but it is certainly true of most of the large, established energy companies, as this report demonstrates.

On campus, meanwhile, the research climate is also rapidly changing. Thirty years ago, large-scale, multi-year strategic corporate research alliances on campus were far less common, and overt academic commercialism was largely taboo. Today the boundary between academic research and commercial research is far more blurry. So far, the long-term consequences of this subtle but important shift in the nation’s science-and-technology infrastructure have not been well explored. This shift is especially important to consider in the energy sector, where independent university scientists and experts are urgently needed to measure and interpret today’s complex global-warming problems, uncover path-breaking new technologies, and provide impartial advice and expertise to the public and government agencies regarding effective public policy.

Because this independent university sector remains so vitally important, the Obama administration, Congress, federal agencies, and university leaders across the country would do well to carefully consider the findings of this report, which point to several intriguing new conclusions regarding the efficacy of developing new sources of alternative energy through joint university-industry research partnerships.

First of all, the manner in which these industry contracts were negotiated and concluded points to numerous potential challenges for future U.S. university negotiators. Many of these agreements fail to make any clear distinctions between independent, academic research and commercial research for hire. If more U.S. universities begin to work with the energy industry through these types of contract-research arrangements then it will be far more difficult for them to continue producing credible, independent energy research in these critical academic fields. One has only to review the extensive science literature on pharmaceutical industry influence and conflicts of interest in academic medicine to see the potential hazards that can arise from tearing down the boundary walls that separate academic and commercial research.

Second, preserving an independent research sector inside top-ranked U.S. universities remains vitally important for the advancement of clean energy research and the health of the U.S. science and innovation system more broadly. U.S. universities have traditionally performed many types of research (curiosity-driven science, fundamental inquiry, disinterested research) that private firms were unable, or unwilling, to finance adequately on their own, because of shorter-term commercial, strategic, and profit considerations. Many of this nation’s most path-breaking scientific discoveries—including those that launched the biotechnology, computing, and information-technology revolutions—were born out of publicly financed research, performed in academic labs.

Of course, private industry has also made enormous contributions to U.S. science and innovation. But until recently, most major firms operated their own independent, commercial R&D labs. It remains highly uncertain what will happen to our nation’s unique academic sector if private industry continues to move its R&D operations onto U.S. campuses without showing adequate respect for the university’s highly distinctive academic research culture.

Third, we need to preserve a research sphere that is committed to public-good research— research that has enormous social value, but which rarely generates commercial profits. In the area of energy research alone, this might include studies comparing the relative social, economic, energy, and environmental consequences of various competing alternativeenergy technologies, or advanced research to measure carbon and other greenhouse gases emitted from various sources, or the development of effective carbon caps, taxes, trading, and measuring systems. Without this type of public-good research—carried out independently of specific commercial- or special-interest groups—it is far more difficult for political leaders and the public to develop effective, enlightened public policies.

Finally, public-private partnerships will certainly be necessary for bringing new cleanenergy research and technologies into the commercial marketplace, whether they originate in academic labs, government labs, or commercial labs. But these partnerships should not be pursued in a manner that compromises the long-term health of this nation’s public research sphere. When U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Energy, issue public-private R&D grants, they should clearly differentiate between the research objectives of American universities and the objectives of the individual private-sector partners. This can be done by crafting standard legal agreements between the federal funding agencies, U.S. universities, and private firms that vigorously protect the universities’ core academic- and public-knowledge missions, including their commitment to self-governance, free inquiry, and research independence. Commercial firms should be required to accept these terms in exchange for government research support.

In the final section of the main report, we offer recommendations for avoiding what we see as the problems with the contracts at these 10 universities, through our “detailed contract reviews” featured in this report’s appendices. The purpose: so the problems will not be repeated at other universities. The goal of these recommendations is to ensure that corporations seeking to partner with U.S. universities to capitalize on academic expertise and resources are not granted excessive commercial influence over the academic research process and, in some instances, overly broad commercial advantages as well. We briefly detail these recommendations here.""" ,
                               """In nine of the 10 energy-research agreements we analyzed, the university partners failed to retain majority academic control over the central governing body charged with directing the university-industry alliance.

                               """It is clear, then, that industry spending on all forms of energy R&D (especially low-carbon energy R&D) remains chronically low. Nevertheless, the industry’s decision to shift more of its already limited R&D spending to U.S. universities is highly significant, and could have far-reaching consequences for the future direction of energy R&D efforts nationally. In large part, this is because the U.S. government commitment to energy R&D has remained persistently low for decades, so every dollar of private industry funding that comes into university labs is urgently needed. Consider that:

From 1993 to 2006, U.S. government spending on all energy-related R&D (in real dollars) remained stuck at roughly $3 billion to $4 billion per year, averaging $3.6 billion per year over this period. This is 60 percent less than the $9 billion the U.S. government spent on energy R&D in 1979. (see graph)

Over the same years, by contrast, real federal spending on defense R&D and health R&D averaged $58 billion and $22 billion per year, respectively. (see graph)

Industry financing of university research is certainly legitimate. Academic-industry research collaborations have led to critical advancements in science and engineering and should be nurtured. Yet industry funding can also have a powerful distorting influence on the quality, topics, and credibility of academic research when it is not properly managed.

Indeed, in recent years a large body of analytic and empirical research has shown that industry-funded studies in sectors ranging from pharmaceuticals to tobacco to food are associated with reported outcomes that strongly favor the corporate sponsor’s products and/or interests compared to studies funded by government and non-profit sources.""" ,
                               """It’s clear that Big Oil and other large energy companies have ramped up their advertising budgets to project a pro-environmental business orientation. But if we crack open the industry’s annual reports, it is also clear that today’s climate and energy crises (and persistently high oil prices) haven’t had anywhere near the impact on energy industry R&D spending that the earlier oil price shocks of the 1970s once had. After rising sharply in the 1970s, energy industry spending (adjusted for inflation) on all types of R&D has plummeted, from an annual average of nearly $6.4 billion in the early 1980s to an annual average of roughly $1.7 billion at the start of the last decade (see graph).

The annual reports of four of the largest oil companies— ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, and Chevron— between 2000 and 2007 (before the Great Recession began) do show some overall gains in R&D spending. But these R&D gains, which are overwhelmingly directed toward enhanced oil and gas recovery, not clean energy, remain truly marginal, particularly in light of the oil industry’s vast profit margins in recent years. In constant 2006 dollars, here’s what these company reports reveal:

ExxonMobil’s total R&D spending has remained essentially flat since 1993, with barely any increase.
Shell had the fastest growth in R&D expenditures over the past five years (out of the four companies); however, because Shell’s R&D outlays had dropped dramatically throughout the 1990s, actual gains were marginal.
BP continues to spend less on energy R&D than either ExxonMobil or Shell. Despite dubbing itself BP or “Beyond Petroleum” in 2000, BP’s aggregate spending on all energy R&D is still roughly the same as it was a decade ago, although the company’s pledge of $50 million per year over 10 years for the Energy Biosciences Institute will lift this total slightly.
Chevron’s aggregate spending on R&D remained extremely low and flat from 1999 through 2004. Since 2005, Chevron’s R&D outlays rose, but they still remain the lowest of the four. (see the graph for details).""" ,
                               """Major findings—A brief synopsis
This report’s analysis of the contracts underlying 10 large-scale university-industry alliances to finance energy research identifies eight major areas where serious limitations on academic freedom and academic research, and governing independence are permitted. What follows is a brief description of the eight areas where these agreements appear to fail to uphold the universities’ core academic and public-interest obligations:

1. Do these agreements protect university independence and academic self-governance?
In nine of the 10 agreements, the university partners failed to retain majority academic control over the central governing body charged with directing the university-industryresearch alliance. Four of the 10 alliances allow for full industry sponsor control over the alliance’s main governing body.

In some cases the written agreement explicitly gives the industry sponsor or sponsors full control. In other cases, this is how the agreement is being interpreted and/or administered in practice. This finding is quite remarkable. “Academic independence” has been rooted, historically, in the university’s core belief that it must retain the ability to govern its own internal affairs. This is often referred to as “academic self-governance” or “academic autonomy.”

Ever since the birth of the academic freedom movement in the early 1900s, U.S. universities and their faculties have worked strenuously to prevent outside donors (whether a wealthy benefactor, a commercial sponsor, or a federal grant-making agency) from exerting undue influence over faculty teaching, research, and other internal academic governance decisions. The rationale for this is quite straightforward: Without self-governance, research independence and free inquiry are meaningless.

2. Do these agreements require faculty research proposals to be evaluated and awarded funding on the basis of impartial “peer review”?
None of the 10 agreements requires faculty research proposals to be evaluated and awarded funding in each new grant cycle using academic methods of independent, impartial peer review. In the case of the Arizona State University-BP research alliance this question does not apply because all the research projects have been identified upfront so no other campus faculty are eligible to apply for funding.

In interviews and written comments, several university officials told CAP that, even though their formal alliance agreements do not require peer review, they do frequently draw on the expertise of outside expert reviewers. Yet, in all the cases reviewed in this report, it is the view of the author and our legal experts that the use of peer review is variable, inconsistent, and/or does not rise to the level of genuine, impartial, expert peer review. And because peer review is not secured in the alliance’s legal contract, its weight in the research-selection process remains unclear, and its application can be altered or simply abandoned at any time. (For more discussion, please see the detailed contract reviews in Appendices 1-10.)

Consider Stanford University’s Global Climate and Energy Project, which is funded by Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Toyota and Schlumberger. Neither of GCEP’s formal written alliance agreements (originally signed in 2002 and renewed in 2008) requires the use of expert peer review for the selection of faculty research proposals. Both agreements’ use of peer review is entirely optional and left to the discretion of the four industry sponsors. Stanford officials respond that GCEP uses an informal peer-review system even though it is not legally required, and that they posted written peer-review protocols on a public website to clarify how this peer review works in practice. But our outside legal experts say this informal peer review system is not legally binding and could be altered or abandoned at any time. (see Appendix 8 for details)

Academic peer review has long been considered the gold standard when it comes to appropriately and fairly evaluating the quality and worthiness of scientific and academic research. When faculty research proposals are evaluated by independent experts using an impartial peer review process, it helps to ensure that corporate-research funding is awarded on the basis of both scientific and academic merit—not merely on the basis of one firm’s short-term business needs or the narrow strategic goals of one industrial sector.

When Cornell University’s faculty senate issued final recommendations in 2005 on how best to structure large-scale, university-industry research alliances, it strongly emphasized the centrality of independent peer review: “The important point—vital to honoring the principal that we are engaged in academic, not corporate research—is that genuine, disinterested peer review occur.”

3. Are these agreements fully transparent about how the faculty may apply for commercial funding, and what the methods and criteria for selection will be?
Eight of the 10 alliance agreements fail to specify in adequate detail how faculty may apply for alliance research funding, or what evaluation and selection criteria will be used. Within the university and scientific communities it is widely understood that high standards cannot be maintained unless faculty research and scholarship is judged fairly and impartially based on academic merit and scientific excellence, not according to the narrow wishes or dictates of outside sponsors.

The notable lack of clarity and transparency in a majority of these 10 university-industry agreements (combined with their failure to require peer review) suggests that funding awarded through these academic-industry alliances will strongly favor the business and strategic interests of the corporate sponsors. Given that nine of the 10 agreements also clearly state that the university side will be responsible for administering and overseeing the research-selection process (on behalf of the alliance as a whole), this could leave university leaders vulnerable to accusations that they are putting the sponsors’ commercial interests ahead of the universities’ core commitment to high-quality research, and the disinterested quest for knowledge and truth for the benefit of the public.

4. Do these agreements adequately distinguish “academic research” from “corporate research for hire?”
The answer to this question largely rests on which party to the agreement defines the alliance’s overarching research agenda, which party draws up the “request for faculty research proposals” in each new grant cycle, and which party retains majority control over the evaluation and final selection of academic research proposals. Let’s consider each of these in turn.

In eight of the 10 agreements that we reviewed, the industry sponsor substantially defines the alliance’s “overarching research agenda.” (The exceptions were Arizona State University and Stanford University.) This is not unusual. No funding source is entirely neutral. Simply by defining what research questions will be asked, nearly every sponsor exerts some degree of influence over the academic research enterprise.

It also is not unusual for the corporate sponsors to play a subsequent role in setting the research agenda during each new grant cycle. In five of the 10 agreements, the industry sponsors and the university partners share some responsibility for drawing up a list of research topics in each new grant cycle, and issuing the request for new faculty research proposals. In four cases, the contact allows the industry sponsors to fully set the agenda in each new grant cycle.

But in eight out of 10 contracts we examined, the agreements broke significantly from longstanding university commitments to academic self-governance. This finding is the most significant one. Usually, when it comes to internal academic governance decisions—including the evaluation and selection of faculty research—the university insists on majority academic representation and the right to use independent, expert peer reviewers. In 2007, for example, a U.C. Berkeley faculty senate committee reviewing the Energy Biosciences Institute partnership stressed that all BP-EBI funded research “should not in any way be conceived of or seen as work made for hire for the benefit of the corporate sponsor.”

Nonetheless, in eight of the 10 alliance agreements reviewed here, the university failed to retain majority control over the evaluation and final selection of faculty research proposals, or to require the use of impartial peer review, thus leaving the distinction between “academic research” and “corporate research for hire” quite unclear and uncertain.

5. Is the university’s fundamental right to publish protected?
Yes. Nine of the 10 agreements affirm the university’s right to publish, but in many instances this contractural right is curtailed by potentially lengthy corporate delays. The National Institutes of Health generally recommends no more than a 60-day delay on academic research publication, which it deems adequate time for the corporate sponsor to file a provisional patent application and remove any sensitive proprietary information. None of the 10 agreements analyzed abide by this maximum-60-day federally recommended publication delay; most far exceed it.

One alliance agreement at the University of Colorado, Boulder and three other publicly funded research institutions in Colorado (known as the Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels, or C2B2) permits the industry sponsors to delay publication for up to 210 days. Another alliance agreement at Stanford University, the Global Climate and Energy Project, gives the four sponsors a mandatory, 60-day review period to consider patent protection prior to release of any academic publications. After this, the agreement provides for no maximum delay on publications, leaving the potential, at least, for indefinite delays. A third alliance agreement with Chevron permits the sponsor to delay publication for up to one year, including student theses.

The timely release of academic information is what makes the university research sphere so exceptionally vibrant, innovative, and dynamic. Rapid dissemination of new knowledge helps to insure that all scientific research is subject to independent review and replication to verify its accuracy. Research should never be quarantined; it needs to be released rapidly so others can react to it and build upon it, continually driving the pursuit of new knowledge forward.

6. Does the corporate sponsor enjoy monopoly commercial rights to all the university’s sponsored-research results?
We asked our outside legal examiners to rank each alliance agreement on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing very weak contract language granting exclusive commercial rights to the industry sponsor, and 10 representing very strong language granting exclusive commercial rights. Seven of the 10 agreements ranked 8 or higher for their degree of exclusivity, thus giving the industry sponsors strong monopoly commercial control over the alliances’ sponsored research results.

Seven of the 10 agreements left the university side with extremely limited power to license sponsored-research results nonexclusively to outside commercial users. But there are three notable exceptions. The first is the so-called “shared side” of the Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels. The second is the alliance agreement between the University of Texas at Austin, Rice University, and ten companies. And the third is Stanford University’s Global Climate and Energy Project agreement. GCEP was originally launched in 2002, but the university and its four industry sponsors negotiated a new, revised contract in September 2008 that greatly facilitated non-exclusive licensing and open academic sharing of GCEP research results through the elimination of a 5-year, sponsor exclusivity provision. (see Appendix 8 for details)

But the flip side is this: At least four of the 10 agreements (BP-Arizona State University, BP-Energy Biosciences Institute, Chevron-U.C. Davis, and Chevron-Texas A&M) explicitly permit the industry sponsors to extend the commercial rights to “background” academic research, which by definition was not funded by the industry sponsors but by public and other sources not party to the alliance agreement.

Because U.S. taxpayers continue to subsidize higher education substantially through general overhead for state universities, federal and state subsidies for student tuition, graduate-student fellowships, educational tax breaks, and federal research grants, most U.S. universities pledge their commitment to patenting and licensing academic research in a manner “consistent with the public interest.” This is generally understood to mean that universities will work to maximize broad public use of their academic inventions and research tools, and prevent any one private or commercial entity from exerting excessive monopoly control, unless it is absolutely necessary to promote commercial development.

Case in point: In one 2008 review of the BP-EBI alliance, a faculty senate Task Force on University-Industry Partnerships noted that “the use of exclusive licenses should be as limited as possible, given our public mission.” Such sentiments have also been affirmed by the National Institutes of Health, and by more than 50 universities that are signatories to a 2007 statement titled “Nine Points to Consider in University Licensing.”

Yet in seven of the 10 contracts we examined for this report, industry sponsors are granted broad, upfront, exclusive commercial rights to alliance research—even, in some cases, when certain “background knowledge” was developed prior to the creation of the alliance and not funded by the sponsor.

7. Are university faculty members free to share their sponsored-research results with other academic investigators?
Using our 1-to-10 scale, with 1 representing very weak protections for academic use and sharing and 10 representing very strong protections, the 10 agreements earned an average ranking of just 5.5 for protecting academic use and sharing. Given how important academic sharing is to the whole university and national scientific enterprise, this is troubling.

Since 2007, more than 50 U.S. research universities have endorsed a public statement listing nine core principles that all universities should be required to uphold in their licensing deals with industry. The first of these principles calls for all universities to include a provision in their industry contracts—often known as a “research exemption” —that permits professors and students to freely share their sponsored-research results (including data, tools, and methods) with outside researchers for non-commercial research purposes, including verification of published research findings.

Nevertheless, only four of the 10 alliance agreements had strong academic-use and sharing provisions, receiving a rank of 7 or higher. Five of the 10 agreements ranked 5 or lower (moderate to poor) for protecting the academic investigators’ right to share sponsoredresearch with other academic scientists and scholars for purely research and non-commercial purposes, despite its centrality to the academic research enterprise.

8. Are conflicts of interest adequately regulated in these university-industry alliance agreements?
Nine of the 10 agreements fail to discuss the management of financial conflicts of interest related to the alliance and its research functions. The lone exception is Stanford University’s Global Climate and Energy Project, where the agreement mentions the need to manage conflicts of interest only with regard to optional peer review panels (convened at the discretion of the industry sponsors) and third-party university grant recipients. This latter reference, however, was dropped from GCEP’s, revised 2008 agreement.

None of the 10 agreements prohibit members who sit on the alliances’ main governing body from having personal financial interests related to the research they are charged with overseeing and directing. At the BP-Arizona State University alliance there is no formal governing body so this question does not apply.

Similarly, none of the 10 agreements prohibits committee members charged with evaluating and selecting faculty research proposals from having financial conflicts of interest related to the research they are reviewing. Again, the lone exception is Stanford’s Global Climate and Energy Project, where the agreement states that peer review panels must be free of conflicts, but these panels are optional, and used solely at the discretion of the management committee members, where the industry sponsors control all the votes.

Furthermore, none of the 10 agreements specifies that these committee members may not award commercial research funding to themselves, or their own labs. This type of potential conflict has already surfaced as a widespread problem at the BP-funded Energy Biosciences Institute administered by U.C. Berkeley. Specifically, after the EBI deal was finalized at the end of 2007, U.C. Berkeley’s press office announced that the executive committee charged with evaluating faculty research projects for possible BP funding would have strong majority academic representation. And when the first formal executive committee convened in 2008 it had eight members, seven of whom were academics and one of whom was a representative from BP. But when this report’s author probed a bit deeper, she soon found that seven of these eight committee members had significant potential conflicts of interest, including all but one of the academics.

Two of the eight executive committee members, including the EBI’s Academic Director and the lone BP representative, had financial ties to firms that could stand to profit from the EBI’s academic research. And five of the other committee members had a different potential conflict: All were listed on the EBI website, in the spring of 2008, as “primary investigators” on research projects funded by BP-EBI. What this strongly suggests is that all five could award BP research grant money to themselves and their labs. At the very least, the application and receipt of BP-EBI funding calls into question whether these faculty members were capable of fairly and impartially evaluating other faculty research proposals.

More recently, these potential conflicts of interest on the EBI’s executive committee seem to have only worsened. As of September 2010, the EBI listed a total of 13 executive committee members: 11 academics and two representatives from BP. Yet 10 of these academics are also listed as primary EBI investigators or heads of projects supported with BP-EBI funding, and one, EBI Director Chris Somerville, continues to have personal financial interests in an outside firm partnering with BP on research that is similar to that of EBI. That means three of the executive committee’s 13 members have financial ties to firms that could profit from EBI research, and the other 10 are academic researchers who have vested research and financial interests with the EBI that could compromise their ability to evaluate incoming faculty research in an impartial and disinterested manner, based on scientific merit (for more details, see the box on conflicts of interest on page 64).""" ,
                               """Methodology used for reviewing the 10 agreements
To better understand the specific contractual requirements underlying each of these university-industry research alliances, we turned to Professor Sean O’Connor, a noted legal scholar at the University of Washington Law School with expertise in intellectual property law and university-industry contracting, and Jeremiah Miller, his former graduate assistant and now a practicing attorney in Seattle. O’Connor is Director of the Law, Technology and Arts Group at the University of Washington School of Law. He provides private legaland IP-consulting assistance to many universities, nonprofits and for-profit organizations. Miller performed the primary analysis and interpretation of the contracts. O’Connor then reviewed his analysis. Their services were provided in a personal capacity. They do not necessarily endorse the conclusions of this report.

All the “academic benchmarks” used in our review of the 10 agreements were drawn from a set of detailed analyses of Strategic Corporate Alliances, or SCAs, on campus, developed by a prominent faculty-senate committee at Cornell University from 2004 to 2005.35 Most of the 10 agreements reviewed here broadly fit Cornell’s definition of a Strategic Corporate Alliance: “a comprehensive, formally managed company-university agreement centered around a major, multiyear, financial commitment involving research, programmatic interactions, intellectual property licensing, and other services.”36 Academic norms and public-interest commitments are not well codified in any single document, but they are frequently referred to and affirmed in university mission statements, faculty senate documents such as Cornell’s SCA review, and statements and reports issued by government funding agencies and prominent university associations, including the Association of American Universities, Association of American Medical Colleges, and American Association of University Professors.

This report’s author used the Cornell SCA analyses and their SCA management recommendations as the basis for developing a list of 17 Review Questions to structure this report’s legal contract review. As such, the legal review is not from a purely business standpoint (since most legal contracts are assumed to involve two business entities) but rather from the standpoint of widely accepted academic norms and public-interest benchmarks, including the need to safeguard the university’s core academic mission, and its commitment to self-governance, independent research, and the dissemination of high-quality, reliable, public knowledge.

With regard to the intellectual property provisions in these agreements, our outside legal experts were asked to rank each agreement on a scale of 1 to 10 to assess the amount of exclusive commercial control over academic research results that each agreement permits the industry sponsors, as well as the degree of flexibility afforded to the university partners (and faculty) to license discoveries nonexclusively and/or to share research with other academics. Knowledge sharing is widely seen as a fundamental duty of all academics, as detailed in “Nine Points to Consider in Licensing University Technology,” a 2007 statement signed by more than 50 universities, and other federal agency guidelines.37 It should be noted that our external legal reviewers’ scored rankings for several of the Contract Review Questions are necessarily subjective because interpretations of law and other intellectual property terms cannot be strictly quantified. Moreover, to the author’s knowledge, these contracts have not been tested in a court of law, so their “legal meaning” has not been definitively elaborated.

The first round of legal reviews were completed in the summer of 2008. In July 2010, CAP invited the universities heading up these 10 alliances to provide written comments on the major contract findings, and any contract updates. Seven of the 10 universities provided feedback, two did not respond to our request, and one, Texas A&M University, requested permission from the state attorney general to deny our request for information relating to its Chevron alliance. To the best of our knowledge, the contract analyses in Appendices 1-10 beginning on page 75 are current.

Many university administrators, in their comments and interviews, raised objections to this report’s reliance on written contracts, noting the existence of other academic customs, campus-wide policies, and procedures and practices developed outside of the written contracts. Many of these administrators also objected to the report’s predominant focus on academic and public-interest benchmarks to rate the contracts, arguing there also is an academic and public interest in drawing private-sector money and expertise into the research and development of alternative energy technologies. They felt this view was not sufficiently addressed in the analysis of their contracts as presented in our major contract findings at the time of their review. These comments from university administrators are presented in the individual appendices beginning on page 75 and are taken into account when germane in the appendices and the main body of the report.

Still, these legal agreements constitute the primary, if not the only, legally binding authority between the parties. Anything that is left up to informal practices and generalized policy is subject to alteration and inconsistent application, and may not be legally binding. Written contacts also enhance accountability, and engender public trust. Thus the focus of this report on the contracts themselves as the basis of the report’s analysis.""" ,
                               """Nevertheless, this redirection of industry R&D dollars to U.S. universities is significant. The reasons: A sizable portion of this university funding is now being directed to “alternative energy research” (especially biofuels), and this shift in the allocation of industry resources has the potential to significantly influence the academic research culture in this new energy arena.

These investments in clean energy research by leading energy companies also appear to be part of the energy industry’s current campaign to project a more pro-environmental public image. Turn on the TV or open virtually any magazine and you’re likely to see an ad from a major oil, coal, gas, auto, agriculture, or other company touting its commitment to the research and development of clean-energy technologies: biofuels, “clean coal” technology, hydrogen fuel cells. Not infrequently, these “green ads” explicitly reference the industry’s multimillion-dollar alliances with U.S. universities, whose prestige and public trust are an added selling point (see box).""" ,
                               """Recommendations for the U.S. government
Launch an “Apollo Project” for clean-energy, climate, and efficiency R&D with strong academic and public-interest safeguards
In 2009, for the first time in several decades, the U.S. Congress significantly boosted energy R&D spending. When both stimulus money and appropriations funding are included, the 2009 Department of Energy budget for R&D bounced 68 percent (over 2008 funding levels) to $16.3 billion, with the largest portions going to Basic Science ($6.1 billion) and Energy R&D ($6.4 billion), and the remainder ($3.8 billion) going to DOE defense-related research. Of this, roughly $3.95 billion is slated for Energy Efficiency and Renewables R&D specifically. Such investments must continue. It is time for the U.S. government to launch a major new initiative to finance cutting-edge research in clean energy and energy efficiency at U.S. universities on the scale of past federal science programs, such as the Apollo and Manhattan projects.

Before the U.S. government invests in additional R&D, however, it should develop “standard contract language” attached to every federal research grant for universities that obligates the university to uphold certain core academic and public interest obligations—no matter whether this funding comes via the federal government alone, or in combination with corporate matching grants.

Require all federal energy grants be issued using expert peer review
Renewed U.S. investment in energy-related R&D should be accompanied by a standard federal contract that requires use of impartial expert peer review by all federal, university, and private industry research partners. Allocating federal science funding through an independent, scientific peer-review process is the only way to ensure that taxpayer grants are awarded on the basis of true scientific merit. Use of independent expert peer-review should also be stipulated in all academic-industry-government R&D alliance agreements.

Allocate sufficient funds for fundamental, pre-commercial science and other vital public-good research
The federal government likes the idea of using public-private partnerships to maximize the economic impact of public science spending. And certainly using government R&D funding to leverage (and also stimulate) industry R&D spending can be a “win-win” combination. But public-good research should involve more than the pursuit of technologies with the potential for near-term commercialization. As transportation expert John DeCicco at the University of Michigan explains: “Ultimately, public-good research needs to be directed toward achieving critical public-good outcomes such as lowering global greenhouse gas emissions in the near term, not just the development of new technologies.” Academic expertise is urgently needed to tackle a broad array of public interest problems, and also to advance public knowledge and understanding.""" ,
                               """Recommendations to U.S. universities
This report also offers recommendations on how to sustain America’s vibrant public research infrastructure, and our universities’ commitment to high-quality, disinterested, public-good energy research. Here, we briefly summarize these recommendations.

Police commercial conflicts of interests
U.S. universities must not allow their quest for research revenue or, increasingly, their quest for earnings from the transfer and commercialization of academic research, to distort their core academic and public-knowledge functions. Industry relationships and other commercial activities on campus should not compromise the universities’ fundamental commitment to the pursuit of truth, impartial inquiry, and public-good knowledge.

This is not to say that U.S. universities and their faculties should disregard the potential commercial applications of their academic research and discoveries. Not at all. But universities need to make a far more vigorous effort to oversee and, whenever possible, eliminate financial conflicts of interest on campus (both at the faculty and at the institutional levels) to preserve their scientific and academic integrity, research independence, and public trust. This process, too, could be vastly aided by stronger federal conflict-ofinterest guidelines attached to federal research grants.

Maximize faculty involvement in the design and oversight of large-scale corporate-research alliances
University faculty, through their main governing body—the academic or faculty senate—should be fully involved in the planning, execution, and monitoring of any large-scale, academic-industry research alliances proposed on campus. These large, multi-year corporate-research alliances tend to have a broad impact on the whole academic institution, due to their size, duration, and potential influence on the public perception of the institution compared to more common, smaller industry-sponsored research agreements. As such, they warrant far greater faculty-senate involvement in their initial design, formation, and subsequent oversight. This will also engender greater campus support and public trust through enhanced transparency.

Safeguard academic autonomy
To protect the American university’s valuable traditions of self-governance and research independence, academic representatives (not industry representatives) should retain strong (preferably two-thirds) majority representation and voting power on any academic governance bodies that are charged with overseeing or administering university-industry research alliances on campus. Equal distribution of voting power is not sufficient, because it does not protect the university’s tradition of self-governance and research autonomy.

Retain academic control over research selection and the use of independent expert peer review
University representatives should retain majority representation (and voting power) on any academic body that is charged with evaluating faculty research proposals, and/or making final research awards, as part of any large-scale, multiyear, university-industry research alliance. Faculty research proposals should also always be evaluated using independent expert peer review so research excellence, not merely narrow commercial preferences or profit criteria, guide the academic selection process. And experts selected to judge faculty research proposals should never be in a position to derive any financial benefit from the alliance (or its corporate sponsors). They should remain free of personal financial interests that could in any way bias or prejudice their evaluations.

Minimize delays on publication
U.S. universities should not permit their industry sponsors to delay publication for longer than 60 days, which the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies deem sufficient time for the commercial sponsor to file for provisional patent protection and remove any sensitive corporate proprietary information. Publication is an academic principle that helps ensure the rapid diffusion of public knowledge, which is independently scrutinized and verified for accuracy.

Protect academic knowledge sharing
Any university that enters into a large-scale industrial research alliance should include a legal clause—known as a “research exemption” or “academic-use exemption”—as part of its licensing agreement with the corporate sponsor. This “exemption” permits all university professors to freely share their sponsored-project results (related to any published academic research) with other scientists, both within their own academic institution and at other non-profit and governmental institutions, for purely non-commercial, research purposes. Too many schools continue to overlook this critical knowledge-sharing function even though it is the first principle enshrined in a 2007 academic statement titled “In the Public Interest: Nine Points to Consider in Licensing University Technology,” endorsed by more than 50 universities.

Resist monopoly ownership of academic knowledge
Researchers rely on the wellspring of shared academic knowledge to stimulate their own creativity, research, and scientific and technological discovery. Over the past several decades, in an effort to extract rents from campus-based research, U.S. universities have imposed proprietary restrictions on a growing share of this academic research. Because U.S. universities remain heavily reliant on U.S. taxpayer support for their research-anddevelopment funding, it is important for these academic institutions to resist the temptation to grant their corporate sponsors exclusive, monopolistic control over the universities’ academic research, most of which is heavily subsidized by public sources. To the greatest extent possible, U.S. universities should license the bulk of their research nonexclusively so it may be used by multiple parties in diverse research and commercial applications.

Together, these sets of recommendations to the federal government and universities would help both private industry and the American public by preserving a vibrant, highquality, public research sector. The analysis of these 10 university-industry research contracts alongside our observations and recommendations can help the Obama administration and Congress as they consider new measures, such as national limits on carbon pollution, a Clean Energy Technology Fund, and other programs to stimulate sustainable energy and clean energy technologies. By ensuring that the balance in these collaborative research efforts tilts strongly in favor of academic independence, the administration and Congress have a rare opportunity to restore this vital balance between our public and private research sectors. Our energy security, global environment, and economic competitiveness all hang in the balance.""" ,
                               """The answers to these three questions are critical to energy-related research and development in our country, given the current global-warming crisis and the role that academic experts have traditionally played in providing the public with impartial research, analysis, and advice. To unpack these questions and help find answers, this report provides a detailed examination of 10 university-industry agreements that together total $833 million in confirmed corporate funding (over 10 years) for energy research funding on campus. Copies of these contractual agreements were obtained largely through state-level public record act requests (see the table on pages 13 and 14 for a list of these 10 agreements, and see page 15 for the methodology used for obtaining and analyzing them). Each agreement spells out the precise legal terms, conditions, and intellectualproperty provisions that govern how this sponsored research is carried out by the faculty and students on campus. (See methodology on page 15 for a discussion of how practices that are not required in these conflicts fit into the analysis.)

Independent, outside legal experts then performed a detailed analysis of each agreement. These experts’ detailed contract reviews may be found in Appendices 1 through 10 beginning on page 75 of this report, and include responses from a number of the universities that entered into these agreements. It should be noted that our external reviewers’ rankings for several of the “Contract Review Questions” are subjective because interpretations of law and other intellectual property terms cannot be strictly quantified. Also, the provisions in these contracts have not to our knowledge been tested in a court of law, so their “legal” meaning has not been definitively established.

The results of this report’s analysis of these 10 large-scale university-industry contracts raise troubling questions about the ability of U.S. universities to adequately safeguard their core academic and public-interest functions when negotiating research contracts with large corporate funders. This report identifies eight major areas where these contracts leave the door open to serious limitations on academic freedom and research independence. Here are just a few brief highlights:""" ,
                               """The world’s largest oil companies are showing surprising interest in financing alternative energy research at U.S. universities. Over the past decade, five of the world’s top 10 oil companies—ExxonMobil Corp., Chevron Corp., BP PLC, Royal Dutch Shell Group, and ConocoPhillips Co.—and other large traditional energy companies with a direct commercial stake in future energy markets have forged dozens of multi-year, multi-million-dollar alliances with top U.S. universities and scientists to carry out energy-related research. Much of this funding by “Big Oil” is being used for research into new sources of alternative energy and renewable energy, mostly biofuels.

Why are highly profitable oil and other large corporations increasingly turning to U.S. universities to perform their commercial research and development instead of conducting this work in-house? Why, in turn, are U.S. universities opening their doors to Big Oil? And when they do, how well are U.S. universities balancing the needs of their commercial sponsors with their own academic missions and public-interest obligations, given their heavy reliance on government research funding and other forms of taxpayer support?""" ,
                               """To our knowledge, this report represents the first time independent analysts have systematically examined a set of written university-industry agreements within a specific research area—in this case, the energy R&D sector—to evaluate how well they balance the goals of the corporate sponsors to produce commercial research that advances business profits with the missions of American universities to perform high-quality, disinterested academic research that advances public knowledge for the betterment of society.

Before Congress releases billions of dollars in much-needed federal funding for more research and development of alternative and renewable energy and energy efficiency via direct grants and other public-private partnerships, it should give careful consideration to the findings and recommendations made in this report. Indeed, this analysis could not be more timely. As proposals to put a cap and price on carbon pollution circulated earlier this in Congress, most major oil companies, including their main lobby, the American Petroleum Institute, continue to vigorously oppose any such carbon caps by running millions of dollars’ worth of negative ads warning the public and politicians of the dire consequences of action. But whenever comprehensive energy legislation is finally implemented, then a significant portion of the funds generated through cap-and-trade legislation will likely be targeted toward efficiency and clean-energy R&D performed by academic experts at U.S. universities.

What’s more, these funds will likely be disbursed through a variety of public-private research partnerships similar to the ones examined in this report. In recent years the U.S. Department of Energy and other federal agencies have shown a strong preference for disbursing federal research dollars through public-private cost-sharing arrangements. According to Doug Hooker, the director of renewable energy at the DOE’s Golden Field Office in Colorado (which handles grant making for DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy), roughly 80 percent to 90 percent of the federal research money that now goes to finance renewable-energy and efficiency R&D is disbursed through some form of public-private cost-sharing arrangement.

Usually, says Hooker, the corporate beneficiary of this DOE research funding is asked to provide a 20 percent to 50 percent matching grant, depending on the stage of the research project and its proximity to commercial application. “We are leveraging the available dollars that are out there in the private sector,” Hooker said in an interview. “We believe it helps with the success rate and the industry’s commitment to these technologies.”

Yet the long-term effectiveness of this strategy remains unknown. John DeCicco, an expert on transportation and a senior lecturer in the School of Natural Resources and the Environment at the University of Michigan, remains skeptical. “The whole concept of using tax dollars in public-private arrangements needs much better scrutiny,” he argues. “This strategy inherently threatens the essence of public-good research, and can blur the boundary lines between independent invention and analysis on the one hand, and strictly commercial R&D on the other.”

U.S. universities, of course, have long relied on a combination of federal government and industry grants to finance their research operations. U.S. academic institutions spent $52 billion on research and development in 2008, the last year for which complete data were available, with about 60 percent financed by U.S. taxpayers through a variety of federal grant-making agencies. Nationally, though, only about 6 percent of university research overall is funded by industry.

Nevertheless, according to some estimates, because of the federal government’s growing preference for allocating federal R&D funds through corporate matching grants and other cost-sharing and cooperative-research arrangements, private industry now directly influences anywhere from 20 percent to 25 percent of university research funding overall. In this way, a significant share of U.S. taxpayer funding that starts out as “public” funding is effectively turned “private” by the time it reaches the university investigators in their academic labs.

Top Obama administration officials, including Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Undersecretary for Science at the Department of Energy Steven E. Koonin, are strong supporters of using industry-university-government partnerships to advance clean-energy R&D. In 2007, prior to joining the administration, both Chu and Koonin were instrumental in brokering a $500 million research collaboration (discussed in detail in this report) between the British oil giant BP PLC and three major U.S. taxpayer-financed research institutions: the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a federal research lab managed by U.C. Berkeley. At the time, Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, was director of Lawrence Berkeley, and Koonin was serving as BP’s chief scientist.

By academic standards, these multiyear, multimillion-dollar industry investments on campus certainly look huge. Yet relative to the oil industry’s vast profit margins, this R&D spending remains infinitesimally small. Consider BP’s 10-year, $500 million investment in the Energy Biosciences Institute at U.C. Berkeley, which is primarily dedicated to researching biofuels. Relative to BP’s profit margins, this mega-size university deal represents little more than a drop in the proverbial bucket. Let’s begin by conservatively estimating that BP’s average business performance from 2006 to 2015 will remain roughly on a par with its 2003-2007 performance. During this time period, BP’s average revenues were $233 billion, and its average profits hit $19.2 billion. If such trends continue, and excluding any significant hit to BP’s bottom line due to the consequences of the 2010 oil catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico, then:""" ,
                               """What do the 10 contractual agreements tell us?
Now let’s turn to the centerpiece of this report: the university-industry-research agreements themselves. The central analysis that underpins this report, and the questions it raises, is drawn from a comprehensive analysis and independent expert level review of 10 recent alliance agreements among as many as 43 companies (some contracts boast fluctuating membership), 13 leading universities, and two federal research labs, totaling $833 million in confirmed industry funding over ten years.

Most of the copies of the 10 agreements were obtained through public record act requests filed with state-funded universities (although these often proved extremely time-consuming and difficult to obtain because many state-funded institutions stalled or outright refused our requests). Several were also obtained from academic administrators through personal phone requests, or had been previously made public. Private universities are not required to (and usually do not) publicly disclose their contract research agreements with industry. Stanford University made a rare exception when it chose to publicly disclose its contract with ExxonMobil and three other companies following campus pressure to do so (see table below for a complete list of the 10 agreements analyzed and the accompanying box on page 15 for an explanation of the methodology we employed).""" ;

That’s the conclusion published in a “peer-reviewed” scientific journal on August 13, 2019, so we suppose it must be true. Climate Depot, spearheaded by Marc Morano, serves as an information clearinghouse and one-stop shop for reporters, policymakers, students, scientists and concerned citizens seeking a balanced perspective that corrects the record on global warming, energy, the environment and other issues impacting people and our planet. We serve as an ombudsman of media eco-reporting.

Climate Depot was launched in April of 2009 as a special project of CFACT, The Committee For a Constructive Tomorrow, a Washington, D.C.-based, freedom-oriented, public policy organization that has been working since 1985 to provide facts and analysis that allow people to make informed choices on these crucial issues. Vast sums are being expended, major economic transformations proposed, and we are regularly asked to curtail individual freedom, all in the name of global warming, climate change, climate crisis, or whatever they come up with next. The dire pronouncements we hear daily, the routine falsehoods and exaggerations, and the questionable, yet undeniably expensive, “solutions” set forth, cry out for critical examination. Climate Depot effectively ensures that examination takes place for all to see. We need to make informed, rational decisions about what drives the climate, whether and what actions are advisable, how effective they would be, and whether the benefits outweigh the costs. Climate Depot fearlessly and diligently provides all sides when we consider a public policy issue. We stand squarely behind your right to speak and know.

Despite widespread public backing for the UK’s legally binding goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and the economic benefits it could bring, climate obstructionists deploy a variety of tactics and strategies to maintain dependence on volatile and dangerous fossil fuels.

Key actors:
Organised sceptic groups and think tanks (e.g. Global Warming Policy Foundation, Net Zero Watch), media (particularly right-leaning papers such as The Daily Telegraph and The Daily Mail), business and trade associations (e.g. CBI), government actors and institutions.

Tactics:
Media campaigns: Outlets such as The Daily Telegraph often publish editorials and opinion pieces promoting climate obstructionism.
Lobbying and political influence: Fossil fuel companies directly lobby elected politicians to shape policy in their favour and fend off tighter regulation. This influence is enabled by donations to political parties and revolving doors and secondments to government.
Key messages:
Economic cost: Framing climate policies as ‘a risk to the economy’, ignoring the more significant financial costs to the public resulting from slow progress on climate action.
Undermine renewables: Climate obstructionists cast doubt on the reliability and cost of renewable sources like solar and wind power, despite evidence that in the UK renewables are significantly cheaper than gas.""" ;

                                               :summary """The case concerned an application by a wind farm company for planning permission to construct a wind farm in Co. Laois. An Bord Pleanála (the national planning authority) rejected permission for the wind farm, citing visual impacts and local development plan designations for wind turbines. Under the local Laois County Development Plan, wind farms would not be constructed in the relevant area based on the alleged visual concerns. Still, as the national planning authority, An Bord Pleanála could grant permission for the wind farm regardless of any alleged material contravention of the County Development Plan. In this instance, however, the planning permission was refused in line with the visual concerns outlined in the original County Development Plan.

The company sought to appeal the decision before the High Court, arguing inter alia that under S15(1) of the Climate Act, as well as in line with EU law and obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, the planning authority had an obligation to interpret its planning decisions such that climate considerations would take priority over the visual concerns and that the authority had therefore taken inadequate account of S15(1) of the Climate Act. The planning authority argued in response that a narrow interpretation of this provision was appropriate, obliging the authority only to give regard to climate considerations and that the authority had, therefore, acted within its powers in refusing permission for the wind farm.

The High Court, in a ruling by Humphreys J. upheld the appeal, finding that An Bord Pleanála had acted unlawfully by failing to exercise its powers in a manner compliant as far as practicable with the climate objectives and policies set out in the Climate Act, and had also breached its duties under EU law and European human rights law. The Court noted that \"if climate goals take precedence over visual impacts [as had been found in a previous case of Nagle View Turbine Aware Group v. An Bord Pleanála [2024] IEHC 603 (Unreported, High Court, 1st November 2024)] and the like, then logically they must take precedence over development plan provisions that are motivated by visual impacts.” 

The High Court further noted that the recent European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) decision in KlimaSeniorinnen v. Switzerland demonstrated that the requirement to read legislation in an ECHR-compliant manner supported an interpretation of S15 that went beyond the board’s approach and that the interpretation should ensure that ECHR obligations are complied with in practice, including compliance in practice with stated goals in relation to renewable energy infrastructure. The failure to properly consider the climate benefits of allowing the project, therefore, constituted a breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Taking the importance of climate action into account, the Court held that the authority had not adequately considered S15(1) in its considerations of whether to grant permission in light of the need to consider climate objectives in contrast to the visual impacts and local planning concerns expressed by those opposed to the wind farms. It stated that \"the need for an imperative reading of S15(1) in line with what it says, namely that the board and any other relevant body is required to act in conformity with the climate plans and objectives set out in the subsection unless it is impracticable to do so.\" [117]

The Court, therefore, granted the appeal and ordered that the application be remitted to An Bord Pleanála for further consideration in accordance with the judgment.""" ;

The investigation launched today involves Bosch Thermotechnology Ltd (Worcester Bosch). The CMA will now engage with Worcester Bosch and gather further evidence to consider whether Worcester Bosch may have broken consumer protection law.
The referenced price range of Worcester Bosch’s boilers reflects the maximum price provided on Worcester Bosch’s website (www.worcester-bosch.co.uk) via its Fast Track installation service in October 2023 (including installation).
The CMA is at the initial stage of its investigation. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that the business under investigation has broken consumer protection law.
How the case will progress depends on the evidence – this could include the CMA closing the investigation if it believes that consumer protection law is unlikely to have been breached, securing undertakings from the company to address any concerns, or taking court action.
As an enforcer under Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002, the CMA cannot currently levy administrative fines for breaches of consumer law, although the government is seeking to give the CMA and other regulators this power as part of the new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer (DMCC) Bill.
At present, the CMA can enforce consumer law through the courts, and where appropriate, seek additional measures to improve consumer choice, drive compliance with the law, or secure redress for consumers.
The main consumer protection legislation relevant to the CMA’s concerns about misleading green claims practices is the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs). The CPRs aim to protect consumers from unfair commercial practices such as the misleading provision or omission of information as part of sales processes.
Alongside its report, the CMA also published a set of good practice principles for quality assurance schemes and is working with scheme providers to implement these principles, as well as with UK governments to help better support and protect consumers in the green heating and insulation sector.
It has been a legal requirement to test all gas appliances sold in the UK with a 23% level of hydrogen gas since the introduction of the Gas Appliances Directive which was implemented by The Gas Appliances (Safety) Regulations 1995.

Labels or text stating that Worcester Bosch’s boilers can run on a blend of 20% hydrogen and natural gas, which may give the impression this is a special feature despite all boilers in the UK being legally required to operate this way since the mid-1990s.
Information and messaging on the use of hydrogen for home heating in the UK – despite this not currently being available and its introduction being potentially years away and dependent on future government decisions.

The CMA published a report earlier this year which highlighted concerns that a number of businesses were making potentially misleading claims online about hydrogen use in boilers and put the sector on notice for further action.

The CMA has also written to 12 other businesses that sell ‘hydrogen-blend’ boilers, after reviewing their marketing, to warn them that they could be breaching consumer protection law and to remind them of their legal obligations.

George Lusty, Senior Director for Consumer Protection at the CMA, said:

Businesses need to be clear about the environmental credentials of the products they’re selling. This is especially important for heating products like home boilers, which are an expensive and long-term purchase.

We set out our concerns earlier this year about businesses marketing boilers as ‘hydrogen-blend’. We’ll now be scrutinising green claims from Worcester Bosch to see if they mislead shoppers.  

In the meantime, we’ll continue to keep a close eye on practices in the sector.

The CMA has also launched a video and published guidance for shoppers about their consumer rights and the key questions to ask when buying a new green home heating or insulation product, such as a heat pump or solar panels. This includes advice on the importance of finding impartial information about products – whether that is environmental or cost related – on finding an accredited installer and checking whether products are covered by suitable warranties and guarantees.""" ;

The motto of the NUM is “The Past We Inherit The Future We Build”. The immediate past is what remains of the coal industry and the miners and their families who worked in the industry.

Whilst there is a need for the NUM it will continue to represent, protect and speak up for the many gains that miners and their communities have made. There are still wrongs to put right and agreements to protect.

News organizations in developed countries provide financial contributions for the rights to Project Syndicate commentaries, which enables us to offer these rights for free, or at subsidized rates, to newspapers and other media in the developing world.

Indeed, because our highest priority is to disseminate authors’ commentaries as widely as possible, we provide translations free of charge, enabling editors worldwide to publish them simultaneously. We currently translate authors’ commentaries from English into 13 languages (Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, and Spanish). Member publications translate into 50 additional languages.""" .

She also connected the current climate, economic and public health crises, linking pandemics like COVID-19 to environmental degradation and social injustice. Her argument did not celebrate the idea of climaterelated lockdowns, but rather laid out the policies needed to avoid them." .

The contested advertising concerned a sticker on Chiquita's bananas which included the statement \"CO2 Neutral.\" The complaint alleged that Chiquita's \"CO2 Neutral\" claim was not true. Several statements were pointed out on Chiquita's website which referred to CO2 emission reduction by 30 percent by the end of 2030. The Commission found the sticker on the bananas with the claim \"CO2 Neutral\" to be misleading pursuant to article 2 of the Code for Environmental Advertising (MRC), as it did not contain any reference to information about the interpretation of this claim. Because any context was lacking, the meaning of this claim was unclear to the average consumer. The Committee noted that the meaning of the environmental claim had had to be made clear in the advertisement. The Committee found it insufficient that the meaning of \"CO2 Neutral\" was clarified on a separate website. It also noted that the mere mention of a website was insufficient to make the meaning of the claim clear. Because the claims were admissible on the basis of the foregoing, the Committee did not have to examine the question whether Chiquita was able to demonstrate the correctness of its absolute environmental claim pursuant to article 3 MRC. However, the Committee did refer to the strict standards set out in previous rulings.""" ;

The party was first registered on 13 March 2019 by Jeremy Hosking as Brexit Express.[3][4]

In September 2020, Fox attracted funding for a new political party, provisionally called Reclaim,[5][6] and dubbed \"UKIP for culture\".[7][5] In October 2020, the party changed its leader from Jeremy Hosking to Laurence Fox.[8] It emerged in the same month that the party name had yet to be successfully registered with the Electoral Commission as there was a naming conflict with the \"Reclaim Project\" of Manchester, an established charity giving opportunities to working-class children.[9] In February 2021, the party changed its registered name from Brexit Express to The Reclaim Party.

In December 2021, newspapers reported that Hosking would continue to fund The Reclaim Party.[12]

Parliamentary representation
MP Andrew Bridgen was expelled from the Conservative Party in January 2023 for tweeting \"As one consultant cardiologist said to me, [the COVID-19 vaccines are] the biggest crime against humanity since the Holocaust\",[13] repeating COVID conspiracy claims and for breaching lobbying rules.[14] In May 2023, he joined Reclaim, becoming the party's first MP.[15] He resigned from the party in December 2023.[16]

Cooperation agreement with Reform UK
On 12 June 2023, Reform UK and the Reclaim Party announced a mutual co-operation agreement for the upcoming by-elections, whereby Reform UK would stand in Mid Bedfordshire and Reclaim would stand in Uxbridge and South Ruislip.[17] Both parties lost all by-elections and lost their deposits, with Dave Kent (Reform) getting the highest support at 3.7% in Selby and Ainsty.

           <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#definition> """Reform UK (formerly the Brexit Party) is a right-wing populist political party and limited company in the United Kingdom.[14] Nigel Farage has served as the party's leader since June 2024 and Richard Tice has served as the party's deputy leader since July 2024. The party currently has five members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons and one member of the London Assembly. The party also holds representation at the local government level, with most of its local councillors having defected from the Conservative Party to Reform UK.[15] Following Farage's resumption of the leadership during the 2024 general election, there was a sharp increase in support for the party. Following the election, it was the third largest party by popular vote, with 4,117,610 votes[16] achieving 14.3 per cent of the vote in total.[17]

Founded in November 2018 as the Brexit Party, advocating a no-deal Brexit, it won the most seats at the 2019 European Parliament election in the UK, but did not win any seats at the 2019 general election. The UK withdrew from the European Union (EU) in January 2020. A year later, in January 2021, the party was renamed Reform UK.[18] During the COVID-19 pandemic the party advocated against further lockdowns. Since 2022, it has campaigned on a broader platform, in particular pledging to reduce immigration to the UK, supporting low taxation, and opposing net zero emissions.[19][20][21]

Farage, who previously owned 60% of Reform UK Party Ltd prior to giving up his shares, had been the leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), a right-wing populist and Eurosceptic party, in the first half of the 2010s, and returned to frontline politics as leader of the Brexit Party during the Brexit process after the 2016 EU membership referendum, which had been called partly in response to UKIP's influence.[22][23] The party won 29 seats at the May 2019 European Parliament election, which was the best result for any single party in the 9th European Parliament. The Brexit Party campaigned for a no-deal Brexit and there were high-profile defections to it from the Conservative Party, including Ann Widdecombe and Annunziata Rees-Mogg.[24] Following Boris Johnson's election as leader of the Conservative Party, Farage offered him an electoral pact at the 2019 general election, which Johnson rejected. The Brexit Party decided unilaterally not to stand candidates against sitting Conservative MPs.

By May 2020, the British exit from the EU having taken place, the party focused on the reformation of British democracy and a name change from Brexit Party to Reform Party was proposed.[25][26][27] The COVID-19 pandemic began in the UK in 2020, and the Conservative government imposed a series of national lockdowns. Farage rebranded the party as Reform UK around the end of the year and focused on anti-lockdown campaigning.[28][29] Farage stepped down as leader in March 2021 and was succeeded by Richard Tice. In March 2024 Lee Anderson, who was elected in 2019 as a Conservative MP, defected to Reform UK, becoming the party's first MP.[30] On 3 June 2024, Tice announced that Farage would become leader once more, with Tice continuing as chairman.[31] The party won five seats in the 2024 general election – the first time that Reform UK had MPs elected to the House of Commons.""" .

Editorial
Steep falls in emissions have been the pandemic’s immediate effect. But what’s needed is a green recovery

So far, discussions of a coronavirus exit strategy have mainly focused on the steps that could bring an end to the lockdown. In the short term, both in the UK and elsewhere, there is nothing more desirable than letting people resume their lives, once it is safe to do so.

But the speed of the “return to normal” is not the only thing that matters. The manner in which the world’s leaders manage the colossal economic and political shocks caused by the virus is also of the utmost importance. And at the top of their list of priorities, alongside human welfare, must be the biosphere and its future.

It’s too soon to say with any confidence what impact coronavirus will have on the climate emergency. The brakes placed on economic activities of many kinds, worldwide, have led to carbon emission cuts that would previously have been unthinkable: 18% in China between February and March; between 40% and 60% over recent weeks in Europe. Habits and behaviours once regarded as sacrosanct have been turned on their heads: road traffic in the UK has fallen by 70%. Global air traffic has halved. Meanwhile, a much-needed spotlight has been thrown on humans’ troubling relationship to wildlife, with some experts arguing that the degradation of the natural world and exploitation of other species is among the pandemic’s causes.

In human terms, the economic contraction precipitated by the virus – and predicted by the World Bank to lead to a severe depression – is sure to be brutal. No one, and least of all an elected government, would have chosen to limit emissions in this way. But if further savage waves of destruction to people’s livelihoods are to be avoided, rather than simply stored up or ignored until they become unignorable, just as coronavirus was, every possible effort must now be made to ensure that the recovery, when it comes, is as green as possible; that any and every stimulus package is directed towards renewable energy and zero- or low-carbon infrastructure and transport.

The urgency and desperation surrounding all such efforts are likely to militate against progressive measures. Already, governments are coming under huge pressure to bail out oil and gas companies (in the US and Canada this has already begun). But while in the short term the low oil price, which is also the result of a price war being waged by Saudi Arabia and Russia, could have the damaging effect of making oil more competitive against renewables, plunging demand and turmoil in the industry provide an opportunity that must be seized by all who oppose the continued dominance of fossil fuels.""" ;

The impact of
their mistake is significant. The Great Reset conspiracy itself arose from a June 2020 WEF initiative of the same name, which outlined the need to rebuild global economic and social systems sustainably after COVID-19. In particular, the WEF initiative suggested using the pandemic as an impetus to reduce economic disparity and address the climate crisis. Their poorly phrased tweet in February prompted some conservative news outlets, such as Sky News Australia, to present ‘climate lockdowns’ as a genuine threat connected to this conspiracy (Figure 6). Meanwhile, for existing proponents, the deleted tweet served only to reinforce their beliefs and provide evidence of a ‘cover-up’.

The MPF alleges that the defendant unlawfully occupied land within an Agroextractivist Settlement Project (PAE), federal property managed by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and occupied by traditional extractivist communities. This ACP is one of 22 actions brought by the MPF following an investigation under Civil Inquiry No. 1.13.000.001719/2015-49 into illegal deforestation in the Antimary Agroextractivist Settlement Project, though involving different defendants.

The MPF bases its legal arguments on Brazilian Environmental Law, emphasizing constitutional protections for the environment, civil liability propter rem for environmental damages (including climate-related damages), and collective moral damages. The MPF also highlights the environmental liability associated with unauthorized greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from deforestation, estimated at 510,046.20 tons of carbon dioxide. These emissions allegedly contribute to Brazil’s deviation from its climate goals, violating the National Policy on Climate Change (Federal Law 12,187/2009) and the Paris Agreement.

The ACP includes the following key requests: (i) reversal of the burden of proof from the outset; (ii) immediate cessation of activities causing ongoing damage; (iii) restoration of the environment to its original state or, alternatively, payment of compensation aimed at environmental restitution; (iv) compensation for interim and residual environmental material damages; (v) compensation for climate-related damages; and (vi) compensation for collective moral damages.

In March 2022, the defendant submitted a defense, denying responsibility for the deforestation and disputing the existence of collective moral damages. The defendant requested the dismissal of the action.""" ;
