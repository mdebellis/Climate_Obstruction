Climate change represents one of the most significant threats humanity has ever encountered. Yet, unlike prior global challenges such as ozone depletion, it has not elicited a unified global response. While this has sometimes been attributed to poor science communication [1] [2], recent work in the social sciences points to a more deliberate cause: an organized campaign of disinformation and obfuscation by powerful fossil fuel interests, a phenomenon known as Climate Obstruction [3], [4], [5]. A group of social scientists known as the Climate Social Sciences Network (CSSN) [6] are primarily responsible for developing this view and doing research to support it. The goal of this project is to provide a Neurosymbolic knowledge graph built on the theories developed by the CSSN.

This research aims to formalize key theories from the climate obstruction literature using a Neurosymbolic approach, integrating symbolic representations expressed in OWL (Web Ontology Language) with vector-based models from a Large Language Model (LLM). In the short term, the goal is to support researchers by providing a unified, natural language portal for retrieving and exploring documents related to climate obstruction across heterogeneous sources. More broadly, this work explores a novel method for formalizing social science theories. OWL provides a description logic foundation for checking model consistency and drawing deductive inferences, while LLM-based embeddings offer a complementary, probabilistic (inductive) analysis of meaning. Together, these approaches form a hybrid framework for expressing, validating, and reasoning about complex sociopolitical phenomena.
