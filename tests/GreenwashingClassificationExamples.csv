"Delta Airlines promoted its flights as 'carbon neutral' based on the use of carbon offsets. In the lawsuit Mayanna Berrin v. Delta, the plaintiff argued these claims were deceptive, since the offsets used were of questionable environmental impact and did not guarantee real-world emission reductions.
Which of the  12 greenwashing types best applies to this case? Justify your answer briefly.","Based on the details provided, this case can be classified as Green Washing by Impact, specifically under the sub-type of Empty Claims or Falsehoods. 

Here's why: The claim that Delta Airlines' flights are 'carbon neutral' relies on carbon offsets whose environmental impact is questionable and does not guarantee real-world emission reductions. This aligns with the definition of Empty Claims or Falsehoods because Delta's assertions about carbon neutrality do not hold up under scrutiny, suggesting that the impact claimed (i.e., carbon neutrality) is unsubstantiated.

The sub-types for Green Washing By Impact are Empty Claims, Falsehoods, Irrelevant, Not Credible, and Selective Disclosure.

The issue here is primarily that the carbon offsets in question may not provide the environmental benefits promised, rendering Delta's claim potentially deceptive.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/05/31/delta-airlines-carbon-neutral-lawsuit/
"H&M promoted its “Conscious Collection” as environmentally sustainable and encouraged customers to purchase eco-friendly fashion. However, the brand failed to clearly define what “conscious” meant, and investigations revealed many items lacked measurable environmental benefit compared to standard products.  
Which of the 12 greenwashing types does this best illustrate?","Based on the information provided, H&M's promotion of its “Conscious Collection” can be classified as Green Washing by Communication, particularly under the sub-type of Vagueness.

Here's why: The brand's failure to clearly define what “conscious” meant aligns with Vagueness, as it involves marketing communications that lack specificity and can mislead consumers into thinking that products are more sustainable than they might actually be. In this case, H&M's lack of measurable environmental benefits in their Conscious Collection exemplifies how unclear messaging can contribute to misconceptions about a product's environmental impact.

The sub-types for Green Washing by Communication are Jargon, Misleading imagery, and Vagueness.",https://www.voguebusiness.com/sustainability/the-flawed-ways-brands-talk-about-sustainability-coronavirus
