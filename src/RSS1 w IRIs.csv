The plaintiff argued that the issuance of the permit was against the 2009 EPMA and Government Regulation No. 36 of 2010 on Nature Tourism Business in Wildlife Sanctuaries, National Parks, Grand Forest Parks and Nature Tourism Parks because it did not involve the community in the permit application process and had the potential to cause damage to the mangrove ecosystem.

The lawsuit seeks to order the defendants to adopt effective measures to comply with the guidelines, deadlines and targets set out in federal and Rio Grande do Sul 's climate laws. It is argued that in the period from 2009 to 2023, the Federal Government, and from 2010 to 2023, the state of Rio Grande do Sul, by action or omission, failed to comply with the legal guidelines and did not meet the deadlines and targets set out in the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC), the Paris Agreement and the Rio Grande do Sul ‘s Policy on Climate Change (PGMC), as there was no effective implementation of instruments such as the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), equal and transparent composition of the Rio Grande do Sul Climate Change Forum (FGMC) and the Brazilian Climate Change Forum and no measures have been taken to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from coal-fired power plants in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with a Just Energy Transition (TEJ) plan, which results in the ineffectiveness of these climate standards. It is pointed out that the climate crisis has led to water shortages in the municipality of Candiota, which has been recognized by municipal decree and that, in parallel to this situation, the various coal-fired thermoelectric plants in the region use local water for cooling, causing damage to the water system, the biome and the climate. It is alleged that the defendants have neglected climate policy when dealing with the licensing and renewal of licenses for these projects in the state. At the same time, the Federal Government has encouraged coal-fired thermoelectric projects through energy auctions authorized by ANEEL. CRM, responsible for the Candiota coal mine, and CGT Eletrosul, responsible for the Candiota III Thermoelectric Plant - the most polluting and least efficient plant in the country - have been operating in disregard of environmental climate laws. It is argued that it is up to the Judiciary, based on the principle of the prohibition of regression and duties of protection, to guarantee effective compliance with the rules in question and prevent the climate scenario from worsening. It is argued that the entire situation of alleged unlawfulness gives rise to a claim for compensation for collective moral damages. The plaintiffs make several requests for injunctive relief for the various defendants, so that the defendants' conduct is brought into line with the environmental climate standards. On the merits, it is requested that (i) the requests for preliminary injunctions be confirmed; (ii) it be declared that in the period from 2009 to 2023, the Federal Government, and from 2010 to 2023, the state of Rio Grande do Sul, by action or omission, failed to comply with climate standards and did not meet the deadlines and targets set out in the PNMC, the Paris Agreement and the PGMC, because they did not give effect to the regulations and did not act to reduce GHG emissions from coal-fired thermoelectric plants in the state; (iii) to declare that Rio Grande do Sul has failed to meet the targets and deadlines set out in international, national and state regulations; (iv) the suspension of public incentives to exploit coal in the state, the implementation of a TEJ plan for the contested plants; the publication of public notices to finance educational projects and research projects with universities and federal institutes that encourage environmental awareness and the guidelines of the PNMC and PGM; the creation of a WG for the decommissioning and energy transition of coal-fired projects; the suspension and non-renewal of energy sales contracts for the contested plants; (v) ordering the defendants to pay compensation for climate damage; (vi) ordering the Federal Government and the state of Rio Grande do Sul to bear the costs of the requests made; (vii) ordering all the defendants to pay the sum of ten million reais as collective moral damage in environmental and climate matters.","The lawsuit seeks to order the defendants to adopt effective measures to comply with the guidelines, deadlines and targets set out in federal and state (Rio Grande do Sul) climate laws.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230706_Public-Civil-Action-ACP-5050920-75.2023.4.04.7100_petition-1.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/instituto-preservar-agapan-and-nucleo-amigos-da-terra-vs-federal-union-and-others-climate-emergency-in-rio-grande-do-sul-state/

The NCP is part of the Department for Business and Trade. It is responsible for promoting the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises on responsible business conduct and for operating the complaints mechanism in the guidelines.
Both airlines are said to have made a significant number of misleading claims about reducing emissions, efficiency and alternative fuels. Additionally Virgin is said to have made misleading claims about net zero, and British Airways about offsets. These claims, individually and collectively, are said to downplay the current and likely future impact of each airline’s operations on the climate. This is on the basis the statements convey the incorrect impression that the airlines are in the process of eliminating the environmental impact of their flights. It is said this tells consumers that they can continue to fly frequently without worrying unduly about their carbon footprint, and it tells policy-makers that they do not need to take steps to moderate the growth in demand for flying. Possible’s position is that, if the world hopes to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, both of these messages are false.",Whether statements by two UK-based airlines about their efforts to reduce and/or offset climate impacts adhered to the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises on responsible business conduct.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231101_67119_complaint.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231101_67119_complaint-1.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/complaint-against-virgin-atlantic-and-british-airways-under-the-oecd-guidelines-brought-by-possible/

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but questioning different carbon credit projects. The Ribeirinho REDD+ Project (Project 2620), which is the subject of the lawsuit, overlaps the areas of five State Agro-Extractivist Settlement Projects (PEAEX). These PEAEX are public lands, whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 2620 was presented to an international certifying company in 2017, but has not yet been registered, to generate REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and an increase in forest carbon stocks) for a period of thirty years. The companies and association are being sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of the rural properties where it is located. The DPE-PA alleges irregularities in the property registrations that make up the project, and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. In addition, the mayor of Portel issued a Public Utility Decree authorising its operation, which the DPE-PA argues is unconstitutional. It is emphasised that no prior technical study was carried out for the project. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and public forest concessions and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. It argues that the defendants' behaviour entails the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) suspension of Project 2620 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 2620 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel.",Whether there were established illegal carbon credit projects in extractivist lands areas in the Pará State.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230719_Public-Civil-Action-ACP-0806464-92.2023.8.14.0015_petition-1.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/public-defenders-office-of-the-state-of-para-vs-associacao-dos-ribeirinhos-e-moradores-and-others-project-2620-carbon-credits-and-forest-carbon-grabbing/

ACCC filed its claim on the basis that GM Holden had not shown any change in the way it manufactured Saab vehicles subsequent to its carbon neutral campaign and that GM Holden’s claim that 17 native trees would offset the carbon emissions was not proven and was misleading.  The Federal Court declared that GM Holden had breached sections 52 and 53(c) of the Trade Practices Act 1974.

RCC Ruling on Arla “climate neutral milk”,2022,2021/00472; 2021/00472 - CvB,Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","Netherlands, Reclame Code Commissie (RCC)","Netherlands, Code for Environmental Advertising, Article 2, Netherlands, Code for Environmental Advertising, Article 3","The contested advertising concerned the statement ""climate neutral"" for Arla organic dairy on the product packaging, the website, and in videos and commercials. The complainant argued that such claims implied that the milk had no effect on the climate. Because this environmental claim could not be substantiated, it allegedly violated articles 2 and 3 of the Code for Environmental Advertising (MRC). The Committee was of the view that an average consumer would interpret these claims in the sense that the production of the products had no impact on the climate in that adverse affects were completely cancelled out. The Committee referred to a previous ruling on Shell ""Drive CO2 neutral"" 1. After giving the defendant the opportunity to provide more information in an interim decision, the Committee found that Arla had not demonstrated the absolute certainty required with regard to the full and permanent offsetting of emissions through its forest projects. Thus, the accuracy of an absolute claim such as ""climate neutral"" had not been demonstrated as required by article 3 MRC. The advertising was therefore in breach of article 2 MRC. Arla subsequently appealed this decision, arguing that it met all the established and highest standards for claiming climate neutrality. Specifically, Arla stated that its ""climate neutral"" claim was a relative and not an absolute one, as the claim related to a label and that it was entitled to use this label for its products. Therefore, Arla argued that this case differentiated from previous cases which had involved absolute claims. The appeal body confirmed the decision of the RCC in part. It found that Arla's statements were misleading to the extent that there was no clarification that the claim specifically related to the label. Thus, the appeal body found the statements to be misleading within article 2 MRC and in conjunction with article 8.3(a),(c) of the Dutch Advertising Code. The appeal body found no violation of article 2 MRC.","Whether the claim ""climate neutral"" with which Arla advertises its organic products is misleading.",No case documents are available.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/rcc-ruling-on-arla-climate-neutral-milk/

Hahn et al. v. APR Energy S.R.L (Juvevir Asociación Civil v. APR Energy and Araucaria Energy),2017,Case Nº: FSM 116712/2017,Pending,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Environmental assessment and permitting","Argentina, Federal Court of Campana","International Law, UNFCCC, Paris Agreement, International Law, UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, Argentina, Constitution","In November 2017, a coalition of individuals and nonprofits brought a preventive action against two thermoelectric power stations Matheu II (APR Energy) and Matheu III (Araucaria), located in the Argentinian city of Pilar. The petition seeks to block the plants on different environmental grounds, including that their construction began without a required environmental assessment, and that the plants are inconsistent with international climate agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement because they will use fossil fuels. The complaint also relies on Argentina's civil code, Constitution and General Law of the Environment, as well as a number of international human rights treaties.
On November 30 and December 21, 2017, the Federal Court of Campana granted precautionary measures halting the construction and operation of the plants. The Court based its decisions on the General Act of the Environment (Act 25.675), the protection of collective interests (Art. 14 of the Civil and Commercial Code) and the prevention of damages (Art. 1.711 of the Civil and Commercial Code). Climate impacts were not expressly addressed by the Court. These decisions were upheld by the Federal Court of Appeals of San Martin.
After a requirement by Araucaria, on December 22, 2022, the Federal Court of Campana partially modified the precautionary measure allowing the provisional (six months) and partial (two turbines) operation of the power plant Matheu III, under the monitoring of the Municipality of Pilar. The global energy crisis and the rising of energy prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine were some of the grounds alleged.
On June 29, 2023, the Court decided not to renew the partial allowance of operation of the plant Matheu III after receiving a negative report from the Municipality of Pilar due to noise pollution. It is worth mentioning that, according to this order, the company APR Energy has presented a Plan for the abandonment of the plant Matheu II.
On February 05, 2024, the Federal Court of Appeal of San Martín uphold the decision of the Federal Court regarding the operation of the plant Matheu III. Furthermore, it asked APR Energy to submit to the Ministry of the Environment a closing audit and to the water authority a notification of the activity’s cease.",Plaintiffs sought to block construction of thermoelectric plants for failing to perform the required environmental assessment,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20171129_Case-No-FSM-1167122017_complaint.docx, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20171130_Case-No-FSM-1167122017_order.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20171221_Case-No-FSM-1167122017_order.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230123_Case-No-FSM-1167122017_order.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230629_Case-No-FSM-1167122017_order.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2024/20240205_Case-No-FSM-1167122017_decision.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/hahn-et-al-v-apr-energy-srl/

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but challenging different carbon credit projects. The Pacajaí project (Project 981), which is the subject of the lawsuit, overlaps with the areas of the Joana Peres II - Dorothy Stang and Joana Peres II - Rio Pacajá State Agro-Extractive Settlement Projects (PEAEX). These PEAEXs are public lands whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 981 generates REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and increased forest carbon stocks), has been certified by an international company and was established in 2008 to obtain carbon credits for forty years. Companies and individuals are sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of rural property. The DPE-PA claims that the land covered by Project 981 is illegal because it is located on public land within the perimeter of the settlements and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. It is emphasised that the project was implemented without a prior technical study. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and public forest concessions and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. It argues that the defendants' behaviour gives rise to the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) suspension of Project 981 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 981 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel.",Whether there were established illegal carbon credit projects in extractivist lands areas in the Pará State.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230725_Public-Civil-Action-ACP-0806631-12.2023.8.14.0015-_petition.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/public-defenders-office-of-the-state-of-para-vs-floyd-promocao-e-representacao-ltda-and-others-project-981-carbon-credits-and-forest-carbon-grabbing/

In this case, Gansu State Grid purchased the electricity generated by wind power and solar energy, but did not connect it to the grid. Defendant provided a strict interpretation of Article 14 that a grid company does not have a duty to put all the renewable electricity it purchases on the grid. Though under Article 29 of the same law, a grid company is responsible for failure to purchase all electricity produced from renewable sources only if such failure were to cause economic damage to the producer, FON argued for an extensive explanation of Article 29 that the defendant’s high curtailment of wind and photovoltaic power resulting in GHG emissions should have been prevented, and that the Gansu State Grid shall be held responsible for the environmental damage caused by its use of coal-fired power.",Whether a company's failure to connect renewable energy to the grid is unlawful as it generates additional GHG emissions.,No case documents are available.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/the-friends-of-nature-institute-v-gansu-state-grid/
RCC Ruling on Shell “Drive CO2 neutral” 1,2021,2021/00190,Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","Netherlands, Reclame Code Commissie (RCC)","Netherlands, Code for Environmental Advertising, Article 2, Netherlands, Code for Environmental Advertising, Article 3","The contested advertisement contained several statements by Shell in the campaign ""Make a difference. Drive CO2 neutral,"" specifically on Shell's website. The complaint alleged that Shell falsely claimed that the damage caused by CO2 emissions can be offset or neutralized through voluntary carbon credits. The complaint was based on various scientific reports, including the IPCC Synthesis Report in 2014. The Committee held that the average consumers would understand the term ""neutralized"" to mean that the harm caused by CO2 emissions was completely compensated by offsetting measures. This impression was reinforced by the manner that Shell issued an explanation of the campaign on its website. While the RCC acknowledged that Shell had plausibly demonstrated that it followed certain standards and guidelines, it pointed out that Shell did not guarantee the full offsetting in practice. The RCC stressed that article 3 of the Code for Environmental Advertising (MRC) set a high bar with regards to environmental claims which must be demonstrably correct. Against this background, Shell's claim were too absolute, as they guaranteed a result which was not certain. Thus, the Committee found the advertising claims to be misleading and in breach of articles 2 and 3 MRC.","Whether Shell's climate neutrality claims based on CO2 offsetting in its ""Drive CO2 neutral campaign"" are misleading.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210412_202100190_complaint.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210826_202100190_decision.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/rcc-ruling-on-shell-drive-co2-neutral-1/

The NCP is part of the Department for Business and Trade. It is responsible for promoting the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises on responsible business conduct and for operating the complaints mechanism set out in the guidelines.
The complaint was brought against Drax, a UK-based energy company, which operates several biomass and hydroelectric power stations in the UK. Drax has an international supply chain operation, including in Canada, Estonia, and the United States, for sourcing wood pellets for use at one of its power stations.
The complaint was brought jointly by The Lifescape Project, The Partnership for Policy Integrity, The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Biofuelwatch, Save Estonia’s Forests, and Conservation North.
The complainants allege that Drax has not observed the OECD guidelines by publishing a range of misleading or inaccurate statements about its carbon emissions and the environmental impacts of its business and supply chain activities.
In July 2022, after an initial assessment, the NCP decided the complaint merited further consideration in respect of provisions in the guidelines on the environment and on consumer interests. That will have triggered an offer by the NCP to the parties of mediation. If any party declined this offer, the NCP will conduct a further examination of the complaint. This would include a determination on whether Drax had acted consistently with the Guidelines.

The plaintiff alleges that the exploitation of minerals in the state is being affected by extreme atmospheric phenomena, a situation neglected by the federative entity. It is pointed out that the negligence regarding the climate issue resulted in the flooding of the Downstream Containment Structure (ECJ) dam built by Vale S/A in the Municipality of São Sebastião das Águas Claras after heavy rains, flooding roads in the region, leaving the district without access to water, electricity, transportation, garbage removal and other essential services. The author indicates that the project was not preceded by an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) or due environmental licensing. The plaintiff emphasizes that the company is unable to measure the impacts of a possible dam failure if the ECJ reservoir is overflowing with water and tailings. It is affirmed that it is therefore necessary to review the hydraulic modeling for this type of project through a corrective environmental licensing process. Still regarding Vale S/A, it is required the stoppage of the Apolo Project, since the studies presented in the scope of its environmental licensing processes would not have analyzed the influence of the intensification of extreme climatic events on the operation of the activity. The environmental licensing process for the Serra do Taquaril Mining Complex, managed by Mineração Taquaril S/A, is also to be halted, considering that the effects of climate change on the project have not been assessed. According to the EIA, due to the Complex, sediment containment basins will be built, which, if they break, will directly impact a water intake pipeline, affecting the supply of 70% of the local population. The plaintiff argues that the National Policy on Climate Change and the State Policy for Preventing and Combating Disasters Resulting from Heavy Rainfall should guide environmental licensing in the State of Minas Gerais, in order to include the climate variable in the procedure, following a decision issued by the 9th Federal Court of Porto Alegre, which determined the inclusion of climate guidelines in the Terms of Thermoelectric Power Plants in Rio Grande do Sul State. It is required that the environmental licensing of the Serra do Taquaril Complex and the Apolo Project must be suspended and the corrective licensing of the JTC must be immediately initiated.
In its reply, Vale S/A informed that the Apolo Project was at a preliminary stage, still under analysis by the competent environmental agency, so as not to represent danger to the environment. It informed that ECJ would already be going through a corrective licensing phase before the competent environmental agency, which is why there was no interest in acting by the plaintiff. It defended the existence of an impossible passive joinder of defendants, since there would be no relationship between the defendants or affinity between the requests made against each defendant. Subsequently, the plaintiff requested an amendment to the initial application, in order to exclude Vale S/A from the defendant's position. In August 2022, a partial judgment was rendered that extinguished the claim against Vale S/A. Afterwards, the court dismissed the action, without resolution of the merits, for inadequacy of the chosen path. It was understood that the Citizen Suit is not an appropriate procedural means for the demand sought.",Whether a permanent injunction can be filed under a Citizen Suit against mining projects due to the omission to analyze the worsening of extreme weather events within the environmental licensing process.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220207_APop-5020547-95.2022.8.13.0024_petition.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/duda-salabert-rosa-vs-minas-gerais-state-and-taquaril-mineracao-sa/

This public civil action is part of a set of 9 lawsuits brought by IBAMA on the same grounds, but against different defendants, to question illegal wood deposits and climate damage.
The plaintiff alleges that the storage of wood without proven origin is associated with illegal deforestation and predatory exploitation in the Amazon biome. Thus, it seeks reparation for environmental damages provoked by it, including (i) the damage caused to flora and fauna, (ii) soil erosion, (iii) contribution to global warming.
As for climate damage, it claims that unlawful conduct not only removed carbon sinks from the forest, but also caused the release of carbon into the atmosphere.
The plaintiff seeks redress through the determination of (i) an obligation to restore the vegetation in an area equivalent to that estimated by IBAMA, based on the volume of logs seized, amounting to 22.14 hectares, ideally in an area of the same biome in Indigenous Land, Conservation Unit or Agrarian Reform Settlement Project and (ii) an obligation to pay the climate damage based on the Carbon Social Cost (CSC) in the amount of R$ 2,149,975.55.

ASA Ruling on Repsol SA (following a complaint by Adfree Cities),2023,,Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","United Kingdom, Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)","United Kingdom, UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing","A paid-for online display ad for Repsol, a global energy company, seen on the Financial Times website on July 12, 2023, featured an image of a water droplet with text that stated “Renewable hydrogen, another alternative to reduce emissions. At Repsol, we are committed to renewable hydrogen as an energy source that offers up different uses such as zero net emissions synthetic fuel production”. The ad also featured a series of graphics: the text “H2” encircled by two arrows; a solar panel with a sun; a car with a stylised letter “e” that had a plug at the end; a wind turbine; two arrows that formed a circle; a sapling; and a petrol pump with a leaf on it.
Adfree Cities challenged whether the ad was misleading because it omitted significant information about the overall environmental impact of Repsol’s business activities.
By ruling of October 18, 2023, the Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) upheld that complaint.
The CAP Code stated that unqualified environmental claims could mislead if they omitted significant information.
The ad appeared on the FT website and in the FT digital energy newsletter. It would therefore have been of interest to investors and those interested in purchasing Repsol’s products. Both audiences would be interested in seeking out businesses, including oil and gas companies, who were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services, including those developing alternative fuels such as renewable hydrogen. However, consumers and many business readers were unlikely to be aware of the specific details of such technology – for example, that the development of renewable hydrogen was in its infancy and was not yet commercially available.
Both consumers and business readers were likely to understand the ad to mean that renewable hydrogen was an alternative to fossil fuels. The ad gave the impression that renewable energy products, including renewable hydrogen, comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Repsol developed and sold, or were likely to develop or sell in the near future.
Repsol’s operations in transforming several of their industrial complexes to aid in the production of renewable hydrogen would not commence until 2024, and their development and production of renewable hydrogen was not yet in operation.
Repsol’s carbon emissions stood at 171 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2021 (50% of the emissions of the UK in 2021, 346.7 Mt CO2e), and they produced approximately 600,000 barrels of oil per day. They also had a substantial oil and gas exploration strategy, owning an interest in 40,660 acres (gross) of oil and gas development and exploration across Europe, Latin America, North America, Africa, and Asia and Oceania. Large-scale global oil and gas investment and exploration therefore formed the vast majority of Repsol’s business interests.
Further information about the proportion of Repsol’s overall business model that comprised lower carbon energy was material information that should have been included in the ad. It therefore omitted material information and was likely to mislead.
The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again in the form complained of. It told Repsol to ensure that their future ads featuring environmental claims did not mislead by omitting significant information about the proportion of their business activities that were comprised of renewable energy, or the role renewable energy and renewable hydrogen played in their business activities.",Whether a paid-for online display ad by a global energy company omitted significant information about the overall impact of its carbon footprint.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231018_21509_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/asa-ruling-on-repsol-sa-following-a-complaint-by-adfree-cities/
CF Partners (UK) LLP v.

Subsequently, Barclays and Tricorona used information gained from their relationship with CFP to arrange for Barclays to acquire Tricorona. CFP brought suit against Barclays and Tricorona, seeking compensation for the defendants’ purported misuse of confidential information and breach of an exclusivity agreement. Based on evidence presented at trial, the court found that neither Barclays nor Tricorona owed an obligation of exclusivity to CFP at the relevant times. The court found, however, that CFP provided confidential information to Barclays and Tricorona regarding the value of Tricorona’s portfolio of CERs and that the defendants wrongfully used this information to their own advantage by arranging for Barclays to purchase Tricorona.

ASA Ruling on HSBC UK Bank plc,2022,,Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","United Kingdom, Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)","South Africa, NERSA Act, United Kingdom, UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing","In October 2021, two posters for HSBC bank were seen on bus stops in Bristol and London. The first featured an aerial image of waves crashing on a shore with text that stated ""Climate change doesn’t do borders. Neither do rising sea levels. That’s why HSBC is aiming to provide up to $1 trillion in financing and investment globally to help our clients transition to net zero”. The second poster featured an image of tree growth rings with text that stated ""Climate changes doesn’t do borders. So in the UK, we’re helping to plant 2 million trees which will lock in 1.25 million tonnes of carbon over their lifetime"".
The Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) received 45 complaints, including from Adfree Cities, who challenged whether the ads were misleading, because they omitted significant information about HSBC’s contribution to carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.
By ruling of October 19, 2022, the ASA upheld the complaints.
The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims be clear and that unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.
The ASA held that consumers would understand the ads to mean that HSBC was making, and intended to make, a positive overall environmental contribution as a company. As part of that contribution, consumers would understand that HSBC was committed to ensuring its business and lending model would help support businesses’ transition to models that supported net zero targets. Additionally, they would understand that HSBC were undertaking an environmentally beneficial activity by planting trees which would make a meaningful contribution towards the sequestration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Whilst the ads appeared in the run up to COP26, that did not mean consumers would understand the intricacies of transitioning to net zero. HSBC’s current financed emissions – emissions related to the customers it financed – stood at the equivalent of around 65.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year for oil and gas alone. That figure was likely to be much higher once other carbon-intensive industries such as power and utilities, construction, transport, and coal mining had been analysed and included. HSBC also intended to continue funding thermal coal mining and power production – a type of fuel that emitted high levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses – to some degree until 2040 (or 2030 in the OECD).
Some level of financing would be required for natural gas and oil production to 2050. However, that meant, despite the initiatives highlighted in the ads, that HSBC was continuing to significantly finance investments in businesses and industries that emitted notable levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. Consumers would not know that was the case, and it was therefore material information that was likely to affect consumers’ understanding of the ads’ overall message, and so should have been made clear in the ads. The ads omitted this material information and were therefore misleading.
The ASA ruled that the ads must not appear again in the form complained of. The ASA told HSBC to ensure that future marketing communications featuring environmental claims were adequately qualified and did not omit material information about its contribution to carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.",Whether two posters for a bank that promoted its green initiatives omitted significant information about its contribution to carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions and were therefore misleading.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221019_21485_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/asa-ruling-on-hsbc-uk-bank-plc/

The submission alleges that since the 1950s, BP Senior Executives have been aware of the climate implications of the corporation’s oil and gas activities because of internal studies conducted into
greenhouse gases. The results of these studies have allegedly been withheld from the public. The submission further argues that as of the 1990s, BP Senior Executives have admitted their role in perpetuating climate change in company documentaries where a link was made between the corporation’s activities and climate change.

- Entrenching dependency on BP’s petroleum products on the false pretense that they are a necessary and viable solution to climate change
- Causing delays to urgent climate policy by portraying climate change as a far-future issue
- Fostering deception of governments and the wider public through misleading marketing of BP as a renewable energy company, using strategic communications to shift responsibilities for carbon emissions onto individuals, and promoting false solutions, such as yet-to-be- invented technology, that prolong the use of fossil fuels

First, ACCR alleges that Santos' claims that natural gas is ""clean fuel"" that provides ""clean energy"" misrepresents the true effect of natural gas on the climate, including the large releases of CO2 and methane during extraction and burning. Second, Santos’ claims that it has a clear and credible plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 are misleading.

The communication is also addressed to, and directly concerns, Saudi Aramco’s business activities in the fossil fuel sector. Saudi Aramco is a State-owned enterprise, owned for 98.5 per cent by the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It holds the exclusive right to explore, drill, prospect, appraise, develop, extract, recover and produce hydrocarbons, as well as to market and distribute hydrocarbons, petroleum products and liquid petroleum gas in the Kingdom. According to the communication, Saudi Amraco’s activities and business strategies are not aligned with the Paris Agreement goals, obligations and commitments, including the ambitions of the Saudi government, and Saudi Amraco’s own responsibilities for human rights protection as a business enterprise under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).
Specifically, despite Saudi Arabia’s net zero targets for 2060, and Saudi Aramco’s own ambition to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050 across its wholly owned operating assets, the company is maintaining production of crude oil; further exploring for oil and gas reserves; expanding into fossil fuel gas; and its misrepresenting information about GHG emissions. Rather than cutting fossil fuel production and emissions ‘at the rapid rate necessary to meet the 1.5°C climate mitigation goal’, it is expanding its fossil fuel activities based on the argument that it has ‘low-cost production’ compared to other countries.
According to the UN Special Procedures, this approach undermines ‘the ability of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to discharge its duties under international law and commitments in the context of the Paris Agreement’, and further ‘disregards Saudi Aramco’s own responsibility to reduce production to address its climate change-related human rights impacts’, as much as other companies. In fact, based on ‘the size, sector, operational context, ownership and structure of Saudi Aramco’ – including the fact that it is a State-owned company – and ‘in the context of the alleged contributions of its business operations to the severity of the human rights impacts of climate change’ over time, there is a ‘heightened expectation’ that this company takes its responsibility under international human rights law. Saudi Amraco bears ‘increased responsibility […] existing over and beyond compliance with applicable laws [...] to act fully in line with international standards and best practices to prevent and mitigate against the human rights impacts of climate change’.
International responsibilities to protect human rights by mitigating GHGs through its own business activities and products follow from the UNGPs (2011), HRC Resolution 48/13 (2021) and UNGA Resolution 76/300 (2022) on the Right to a Clean, Healthy and Sustainable Environment, and the UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment (2018). Special attention is drawn to the report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment on States’ obligations in relation to climate change (A/74/161), stating that ‘further exploration for additional fossil fuels’ must be prohibited because ‘not all existing reserves can be burned while still meeting the commitments of the Paris Agreement’. In addition, States must prohibit the most polluting and environmentally destructive fossil fuel activities, including ‘oil and gas produced from hydraulic fracturing’. All of this follows from the right to a healthy environment, and related human rights,  ‘including the rights to life, health, food, water, housing and culture’.
In relation to ‘access to information’, Saudi Arabia acts in violation of ‘international human rights standards that require that businesses should ensure adequate and accurate disclosure and reporting of their climate impacts in an accessible manner’. Saudi Amraco omits important information about Scope 3 emissions from its reporting and advertising, which is ‘inconsistent with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures standards’. Inaccurate information on GHG emissions can lead to underestimating the climate change crisis, and in turn, exacerbate negative human rights impact due to climate change. Therefore, all companies ‘should refrain from supporting and/or engaging in public information campaigns based on inaccurate, misleading, and unfounded assertions that harm the ability of States and the public to make informed decisions pertaining to climate change’.
Finally, the communications note that Saudi Amraco increasingly sought and received private financial support from a range of financial institutions, e.g. through borrowing funds, selling bonds or equities, or getting support for financial transactions, or for investments in its oil and gas infrastructures. Each of these financial activities help finance the harmful activities of Saudi Amraco that ‘are contributing to climate change-related human rights impacts’, in a manner that is contrary to the human rights responsibilities of these financial institutions.
In August-September 2023, Japan, UK and France responded to communication, as well as Société Générale S.A., Crédit Agricole S.A., BNP Paribas, HSBC, Mizuho Financial Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The companies all outline their respective approaches to human rights under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; OECD Guidelines; as well as Equator Principles, UN Global Compact or International Bill of Rights more generally.","Negative human rights impacts of (expanding) fossil fuel activities by State-owned company Saudi Amraco, with support of major private financial

Subsequently, CAPG and the Comunidade da Aldeia Guarani Guajayvi joined the claim as plaintiffs. The plaintiffs ask the court to suspend and cancel the environmental permitting process for the Guaíba Mina Project, led by Copelmi, considered the largest open-pit coal project in the country. The authors claim that there is non-compliance with legal norms and omissions in the Environmental Impact Study (EIA), as well as the absence of prior, free and informed consultation with the indigenous people of the Poty Guarani Indigenous Association, especially the Aldeia (TeKoá) Guajayvi of the MByá Guarani people, located in Charqueadas/RS, less than 3 kilometers from the project site. When the case was filed, the project was in the preliminary permitting phase with FEPAM. According to the Consultation Notices referring to the environmental impact assessment, four public hearings were held. After the first two hearings, the period for sending public comments related to the project began. The authors allege that Aldeia Guajayvi submitted a request to submit comments, but was not heard.

RCC – CvB Ruling on Shell “Compensate your emissions”,2022,,Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","Netherlands, Reclame Code Commissie (RCC)","Netherlands, Code for Environmental Advertising, Article 2, Netherlands, Code for Environmental Advertising, Article 3","The contested advertising concerned several statements on Shell's website regarding the campaign ""Make a difference. Compensate CO2 emissions."" The complaint was in line with the previous ruling on Shell ""Drive CO2 neutral"" 1 in which the RCC held that Shell's advertising was in breach of articles 2 and 3 of the Code for Environmental Advertising (MRC). After the ruling, Shell had replaced ""CO2 neutral"" with ""CO2 compensation."" The complainants argued that these terms were synonymous and that an average consumer would understand the compensation claims as undoing the climatic harm caused by fossil fuels. But Shell had not provided the scientific evidence that the promised offsetting actually led to this result in practice. The Committee found this claim not to be different from the previously assessed ""CO2 neutral"" claim. Thus, the Committee found the claim to be misleading and in breach of articles 2 and 3 MRC. Shell appealed the ruling and argued that the Committee's interpretation of the claim put Shell in an impossible evidential position which would hinder Shell to communicate about its CO2 offset program. The appeal body of the RCC confirmed the preliminary ruling.",Whether Shell's advertising on CO2 compensation is misleading.,No case documents are available.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/rcc-cvb-ruling-on-shell-compensate-your-emissions/

The trial judge ruled in favour of the respondents, stating that the appellant has no legal standing and that the procedure was confused. The appellant filed an appeal, arguing that they have sufficient personal interest, the activities of the respondents pose environmental danger, and they have a statutory interest in the subject matter. The appellant also argued that there was no mix-up in the originating process and that the ruling was against the weight of evidence. The court found that the respondents were premature in moving to dismiss the action and that there were not enough materials for the trial judge to make a valid decision. The court emphasized the importance of filing a statement of claim and an affidavit in support of a motion to dismiss for want of legal competence.

ASA Ruling on Intrepid Travel Group UK Ltd,2023,,Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","United Kingdom, Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)","United Kingdom, UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing","In November 2022, a poster was seen on the London Underground for Intrepid Travel. The ad featured two women in front of the Giza Pyramids in Egypt, alongside the text “People & planet-friendly small group adventures since 1989”.
A complaint was made to the Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”). The complainant challenged whether the claim “people & planet-friendly small group adventures” misleadingly minimized the impact of Intrepid Travel’s holidays on the environment.
By ruling of May 31, 2023, the ASA upheld that complaint.
The CAP Code stated that the basis of environmental claims must be clear, and that unqualified claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. It also stated that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise, and required that marketing communications did not mislead consumers about a product’s total environmental impact. The Code further required that absolute claims were supported by a high level of substantiation.
Intrepid Travel had commented that they did not offer flights as part of their travel packages, and that consumers would therefore understand that the claim was a narrow reference to their tour offering only. However, the claim was not qualified with that information. The presentation of the Giza Pyramids in Egypt within the ad, together with the claim “planet-friendly”, indicated that such tours were international and that it would be necessary to travel, in most cases by flying, to take part in their tours.
The claim “people & planet-friendly small group adventures” was an absolute claim, which would be understood to mean that taking part in an Intrepid tour caused no environmental damage throughout its full life cycle. The ASA therefore expected to see evidence which demonstrated that taking part in an Intrepid Travel tour, including the necessary travel to and from the destination location, caused no environmental damage over its full life cycle.
Whilst Intrepid Travel took part in a number of environmental schemes, these did not relate to the life cycle of a holiday with Intrepid Travel, and they had not been referred to in the ad. Also many of these initiatives were targeted to deliver results years into the future. Also, whilst Intrepid Travel had a carbon offsetting programme, resulting in it being certified as carbon neutral, Intrepid Travel did not calculate all greenhouses gases produced by their consumers travelling to and from their tour locations, nor did their offsetting programme take account of those emissions.
Because air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which made a substantial contribution to climate change, and those emissions were not accounted for by Intrepid Travel, the absolute claim “people & planet-friendly adventures” had not been adequately substantiated. The ad had misleadingly minimized the impact of Intrepid Travel’s holidays.
The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again in the form complained of. The ASA told Intrepid Travel to ensure that the basis of future environmental claims was made clear and did not give a misleading impression of the impact of their holidays, and that robust substantiation was held to support future claims.",Whether a poster for a travel company misleadingly minimized the impact of their holidays on the environment.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230531_21501_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/asa-ruling-on-intrepid-travel-group-uk-ltd/

While the Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main denied this, the Higher Regional Court partly came to a different conclusion. Disagreeing with the Higher Regional Court of Schleswig, the Court held that advertising of a company or a product as climate neutral may have a significant influence on a purchase decision. It further stated that the term 'climate neutral' had a clear meaning - in contrast to the Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main which had stated the opposite and held that it could be mixed up with the term 'emission free'. The Court elaborated that average consumers understood climate neutrality in the sense of a 'balanced balance sheet'. Furthermore, it held that climate neutrality could be reached through emission reduction as well as compensation measures. Consumers had to know whether climate neutrality concerned the whole company and/or certain products. But because emission trading and other compensation measures generally were under the suspicion of greenwashing, consumers had a significant interest regarding the information of the measures taken on behalf of the company in order to reach the alleged climate neutrality.",Advertising on detergents as 'climate neutral' by using a respective logo which a competitor of the defendant alleged was misleading and in breach of the German Act against Unfair Competition.,No case documents are available.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/higher-regional-court-of-frankfurt-am-mains-decision-on-climate-neutral-claims-regarding-detergents/

Luciano Lliuya v. RWE AG,2015,Case No. 2 O 285/15 Essen Regional Court,On Appeal,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, GHG emissions reduction","Germany, Essen, Higher Regional Court","Germany, Civil Code para. 1004","In November 2015, Saúl Luciano Lliuya, a Peruvian farmer who lives in Huaraz, Peru, filed claims for declaratory judgment and damages in the District Court Essen, Germany against RWE, Germany’s largest electricity producer. Luciano Lliuya’s suit, supported by NGO Germanwatch, alleged that RWE, having knowingly contributed to climate change by emitting substantial volumes of greenhouse gases (GHGs), bore some measure of responsibility for the melting of mountain glaciers near his town of Huaraz. Especially, as the melting gave rise to an acute threat: Palcacocha, a glacial lake located above Huaraz, has experienced substantial volumetric increase since 1975, which has dramatically accelerated from 2003 onwards. Luciano Lliuya presented several legal theories in support of his claim, including one that characterized RWE's emissions as a nuisance due to which plaintiff had incurred compensable costs to mitigate. Acknowledging that RWE was a contributor to the emissions responsible for climate change and thus for the lake's growth, Luciano Lliuya asked the court to order RWE to reimburse him for a portion of the costs that he and the Huaraz authorities are expected to incur from setting up flood protections. The share calculated amounted to 0.47% of the total cost - the same percentage as RWE’s estimated contribution to global industrial greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of industrialization (from 1751 onwards).",Liability of greenhouse gas emitter for harms arising in different jurisdiction from warming effects of climate change arising in a different jurisdiction.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2015/20151123_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_complaint-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2016/20160428_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_reply-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2016/20160711_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_na-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2016/20161115_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_na-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2016/20161128_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_na-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2016/20161215_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_decision.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20170223_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_appeal-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20170710_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_reply-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20170905_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_na-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20171030_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_na-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20171130_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_press-release.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20171127_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_na-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20171130_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_order.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20171211_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_order.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20171211_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_order-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180207_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_order-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210701_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_order.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210927_Case-No.-2-O-28515-Essen-Regional-Court_order.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/lliuya-v-rwe-ag/

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but challenging different carbon credit projects. The REDD+ 2252 project, which is the subject of the lawsuit, overlaps the areas of 5 State Agro-Extractivist Settlement Projects (PEAEX). These PEAEX are public lands, whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 2252 generates REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and increased forest carbon stocks), was certified by an international company and has been established since 2016 to generate carbon credits for thirty years. Companies and individuals are sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of rural properties where it is located. The DPE-PA alleges irregularities in the property registrations that make up the project, and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. In addition, the mayor of Portel issued a Public Utility Decree authorising its operation, which the DPE-PA argues is unconstitutional. It is emphasised that the project was implemented without a prior technical study. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, that they did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and the concession of public forests and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. It argues that the defendants' behaviour entails the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) the recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) the suspension of Project 2252 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 2252 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel.",Whether there were established illegal carbon credit projects in extractivist lands areas in the Pará State.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230720_Public-Civil-Action-ACP-0806505-59.2023.8.14.0015-_petition-1.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/public-defenders-office-of-the-state-of-para-vs-brazil-agfor-llc-and-others-project-2252-carbon-credits-and-forest-carbon-grabbing/

Smith v Fonterra,2024,,Decided,,"New Zealand, Supreme Court of New Zealand","New Zealand, Common law","Michael Smith brought tort claims against New Zealand’s seven largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters, collectively responsible for one-third of all New Zealand’s GHGs. He argued their activities amount to torts of public nuisance, negligence, and a novel climate duty. Smith further argued that these emissions affect him personally. As a Māori leader with an interest in customary land, Smith argued that the defendants’ actions would harm him through impacts related to rising sea levels, loss of sites of cultural and spiritual significance, damage to fisheries, and adverse health impacts. Smith asked the Court to issue declarations against the defendants, and to require them to reduce emissions. Notably, Smith did not seek damages.
Two of Smith’s arguments were struck out by the trial court, though the third claim – the novel climate duty – was allowed to go to trial. New Zealand’s Court of Appeal, however, struck out all three claims, meaning that Smith would not receive his day in court. In this most recent ruling, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed that decision. All three of Smith’s claims will now proceed to what may the be first full climate tort claim in a common law jurisdiction.
In February 2024, the Supreme Court released its strike out decision. Rather than ruling on the merits of Smith’s argument, the Court considered whether the claims should be struck out before the even reached trial. Under New Zealand law, such arguments should be struck out only if they “disclose[] no reasonably arguable cause of action”. This is a high threshold, and that surviving a strikeout challenge is no guarantee of success at trial. The decision is ultimately about whether Smith’s main claim in public nuisance amounts to a “reasonably arguable cause of action”. The Court clarified that a person is liable in public nuisance where they either (a) do an act not warranted by law, or (b) omit to discharge a legal duty; and further, where “the effect of the action or omission is to endanger the life, health, property or comfort of the public or to obstruct the public in the exercise or enjoyment of rights common to all Her Majesty’s subjects”.  In other words, a public nuisance is something which endangers public interests, or public rights.
First, the Court analyzed whether Smith had plausibly identified public rights which were being interfered with. The Court found that he had – the impacts of climate change would indeed engage rights which fit within the categories identified in existing case law. Secondly, the Court affirmed the appellate court’s finding that public nuisance need not involve otherwise illegal activity. In other words, the fact that the defendants’ GHG emissions were not illegal was not a basis for striking out the claim. Third, the court considered the “special damage” rule. This is a standing rule which requires that public nuisance claims only be brought by plaintiffs who are harmed in a way that is different from the general public. The Court queried whether this rule should remain part of the law; and even if it did, Smith’s material and cultural interests as a Māori coastal landowner were at least plausibly “special” enough to meet the rule’s requirements.
Finally, the Court considered of causation. Demonstrating a specific causal chain between a defendant’s emissions and the plaintiff’s harms is extremely challenging. No single emitter is the cause of any person’s harm. Instead, any emitter’s GHG emissions mix with emissions of millions of others, contributing to a global problem. How does one differentiate the defendants’ actions from those of any other, particularly given New Zealand’s globally small (though per capita large) contribution to GHG emissions?
The Court found that Smith had done enough for these questions to proceed to trial. Importantly, the Supreme Court found that the causation problems presented by Smith’s claims were fundamentally similar to other public nuisances involving multiple contributors, such as Industrial Revolution-era air and water pollution cases. “Climate change”, the Court concluded, “engages comparable complexities, albeit at a quantum leap scale of enlargement”. “Cumulative causation” problems presented by climate change should at least receive “evidence and policy analysis”, and should proceed to a full trial: “the common law must develop, if at all, in the fertile fields of trial, not on the barren rocks of a strike out application”.
Having found that Smith had done enough to show a reasonable public nuisance case, the Court permitted the two remaining causes of action – negligence and the proposed novel duty – to also progress to trial. The Court also rejected arguments that the common law claims were displaced by New Zealand’s statutory regime for climate torts.","Whether the greenhouse gas emitting activities of New Zealand’s largest emitters amount to violations of common law duties under public nuisance, negligence, and a novel climate tort.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220715_43018_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/smith-v-fonterra/

Arguments against the practice included its harms to air quality, its release of greenhouse gas emissions, and its harmful affects on human health--particularly that of farm workers. Hearing the case on appeal, the Superior Court of Justice determined that burning should be permitted only in exceptional circumstances, and that sugar refining in general must be less polluting, even if that means being more capital-intensive. In arriving at its decision, the Court acknowledged the appellants' argument that burning cane does not add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere on a net basis over a multi-year timeframe, because it only releases gases absorbed by the cane over the prior 12-18 months.

ASA Ruling on Petroliam Nasional Berhad (trading as Petronas),2023,,Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","United Kingdom, Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)","Mexico, Guidelines for the integral prevention and control of methane emissions from the hydrocarbon sector, United Kingdom, UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing","In September 2022, a TV ad for Petronas was seen. The ad began with a voice-over, spoken by a child, which said, “Our story began with a dream, to see if we could take on an industry. It wasn't easy, but slowly, good began to happen.” Scenes of traffic moving, a port full of shipping containers, broken ice floating on the sea, litter in a river and a forest fire were shown. The voice-over continued, “But as the world produced more energy it became nature's problem, and we were part of it. An answer was needed so we started connecting the dots, to become a progressive energy and solutions partner, enriching lives for a sustainable future.” Solar panels, children in classrooms, a well being built and recycling in a factory were shown. The voice-over said, “To reduce emissions, grow renewable energy, bring education to more, champion social impact and promote a circular economy, as well as achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050” and text stating “Net Zero 2050” was shown on screen. The voice-over continued, “Let's connect the dots together and create a more sustainable future for all so that our next generation will always have something to look forward to” and a child was shown looking out into the distance.
By a ruling of June 7, 2023, the ASA upheld its challenge to the ad.
The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear and stated that claims could mislead if material information was omitted.
Consumers would understand the ad to mean that Petronas was already an energy company that was contributing to a sustainable future by making progress towards emissions reductions and growing the use of renewable energy, as well as having a plan in place that would result in it achieving these goals and net zero by 2050.
The acknowledgment in the ad that Petronas was part of “nature’s problem” was about their past contribution. It did not therefore counteract the claims in the ad about Petronas’s current activities and future plans.
Petronas told ASA that they were taking steps towards net zero and promoting sustainable energy, and these were reflected in the ad. Other claims in the ad were said to be intended to be aspirational rather than targets that had already been achieved. However, despite that, in 2021 Petronas’ operations produced 45.2 million tons of greenhouse gases. While viewers would recognise that companies in the oil industry were likely to be higher emitters of greenhouse gases than many other industries, they would not understand the extent of Petronas’ continuing significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions given the presentation and claims in the ad, which went beyond aspirational claims. The information about the balance of Petronas’ current activities, its emissions and the pathway to reducing them in line with the claims made in the ad, was therefore material information likely to affect consumers’ understanding of the ad’s overall message and so should have been made clear. The ad therefore omitted material information and was misleading.
The ASA ruled that the ad must not be broadcast again in its current form. The ASA told Petronas to ensure their future marketing communications did not misleadingly omit material information.
This Ruling formed part of a wider piece of work on environmental claims in the energy sector, following intelligence gathered by the Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”).","Whether a TV ad for Petronas misleadingly omitted material information about the balance of its current activities, its emissions, and the pathway to reducing them.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230607_21505_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/asa-ruling-on-petroliam-nasional-berhad-trading-as-petronas/

New Weather Institute v. FIFA,2022,,Pending,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","United Kingdom, Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)","United Kingdom, UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing","In November 2022, the New Weather Institute (the Complainant) submitted a complaint against FIFA to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), the self-regulatory organisation of the advertising industry in the UK. The Complainant alleges that FIFA’s claims that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was carbon-neutral are wrong and likely to mislead consumers in the UK, therefore breaching multiple provisions of the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing (“the Code”), and specifically the provisions on misleading advertising and on environmental claims.
FIFA presented the 2022 Qatar World Cup as “fully carbon-neutral” in its online presence. It operated a “climate pledge” mechanism targeting ticket holders, requesting of them to make efforts towards reducing their carbon footprint in their daily life, and informing those taking the pledge that their emissions were offset by FIFA.
In particular, the Complainant alleges that FIFA:
-	firstly, ignored emissions reductions as an essential part of carbon-neutrality; it did not demonstrate that it has done everything it can to reduce its own emissions prior to compensating for the remaining emissions (e.g. when it decided to attribute the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, a country with little football infrastructure in place).
-	secondly, used unsound methodology for its GHG accounting, breaching the Code by only partially accounting for the life cycle of the stadiums, by sending wrong signals regarding the stadiums’ impact on the environment, and by not taking into account day shuttle flights advertised for by Gulf regional airlines when calculating flight emissions of ticket holders.
-	thirdly, and more broadly, generally claimed that a mega-event like the World Cup can be compensated with offsetting. The carbon credits bought by FIFA fail to meet some of the carbon market standards, as they lack additionality and do not permanently remove carbon. Further, the Code was allegedly breached by FIFA by failing to reach the level of substantiation required for an absolute statement like that of carbon-neutrality.
By claiming carbon-neutrality in this way, FIFA allegedly gave ticket holders the impression that attending the World Cup does not have an impact on the environment.
The claim was joined with four other complaints into one joint proceeding before the Swiss Commission on Fairness. The commission upheld all five claims in June 2023.",Whether FIFA's claims that the 2022 World Cup was carbon-neutral are misleading by giving consumers the impression that attending the event has no impact on the environment and therefore in breach of the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20211101_18772_complaint.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230607_18772_decision.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/new-weather-institute-v-fifa/
ASA Ruling on Lufthansa (complaint no.2 in 2023),2023,,Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","United Kingdom, Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)","United Kingdom, UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing","""A paid-for Google ad for Lufthansa, seen in July 2023, stated “Fly now with Lufthansa […] Book your ticket directly with Lufthansa and explore destinations around the world […] Fly more sustainably”.
The relevant advertising code stated that the basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. Comparative claims could be justified if the basis of the comparison was clear.
Consumers would understand the claim that people could “Fly more sustainably” with Lufthansa to mean that they offered a way to travel by air that had a lower environmental impact than alternative airlines. The ad did not clarify how this claim worked in practice, and the basis of the claim was likely to be material information which consumers would need in order to make an informed decision.
While it was noted that flying with the Green Fares option used “sustainable aviation fuel” as part of the fuel mix for that flight and made contributions to climate protection projects, and that this might decrease some of the negative environmental impact of flying with Lufthansa, the basis for the claim """"Fly more sustainably” had not been made clear.

ASA Ruling on Lufthansa,2023,,Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","United Kingdom, Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)","United Kingdom, UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing","A poster for Lufthansa, seen in June 2022, featured an image of the front of a plane in flight. The underside of the plane was represented by an image of the earth from space. The ad included text which stated, “LUFTHANSA GROUP. CONNECTING THE WORLD. PROTECTING ITS FUTURE. #MakeChangeFly”.
The Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) challenged whether the ad gave a misleading impression of Lufthansa’s environmental impact.
By ruling of March 1, 2023, the ASA upheld that challenge.
The CAP Code required that absolute environmental claims be supported by a high level of substantiation.
The claim “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE” was likely to be interpreted by consumers as an environmental reference to how Lufthansa's approach to aviation was protecting the future of the world. Further, it was likely to be understood to mean Lufthansa had already taken significant mitigating steps to ensure that the net environmental impact of their business was not harmful.
However air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. Many of the initiatives Lufthansa said they were committed to delivering were targeted to deliver results only years or decades into the future. There were currently no environmental initiatives or commercially viable technologies in the aviation industry which would substantiate the absolute green claim “PROTECTING ITS FUTURE”, as consumers would interpret it.
The basis of the claim had therefore not been made clear and it had not been adequately substantiated, meaning the ad breached the Code.
The ASA told Lufthansa to ensure that the basis of future environmental claims was made clear and did not give a misleading impression of the impact caused by travelling with the airline, and that robust substantiation was held to support future claims",Whether a poster for Lufthansa made misleading claims about the airline’s environmental impact.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230301_21503_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/asa-ruling-on-lufthansa/

This ACP is part of a set of four lawsuits filed by the DPE-PA on the same grounds, but challenging different carbon credit projects. The RMDLT Portel-Pará REDD Project or Rio Mandaquari REDD+ Project (Project 977), which is the object of the lawsuit, overlaps areas of the State Agro-Extractivist Settlement Projects (PEAEX) Deus é Fiel and Joana Peres II - Dorothy Stang. These PEAEXs are public lands whose real right of use is granted to traditional communities located in the municipality of Portel, in the state of Pará, which did not participate in the contested project. Project 977 generates REDD+ assets (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and increased forest carbon stocks), was certified by an international company and was established in 2009 to generate carbon credits for forty years. Companies and individuals are sued for being responsible, developers of the project or alleged owners of the rural properties where it is located. The DPE-PA alleges irregularities in the property registrations that make up the enterprise, and that the project does not have authorisation from the state of Pará, which characterises the grabbing of public land. In addition, the mayor of Portel issued a Public Utility Decree authorising its operation, which the DPE-PA argues is unconstitutional. It is emphasised that the project was implemented without a prior technical study. The DPE-PA argues that the defendants acted in violation of the right to traditional territory, the right to prior, free and informed consultation of traditional communities, that they did not comply with federal legislation on climate change, payments for environmental services and public forest concessions and did not benefit the communities directly affected by the project. The plaintiff argues that the defendants' behaviour entails the duty to compensate for collective moral damage. As an injunction, the plaintiff requests (i) recognition of the possession of the lands by the traditional communities; (ii) suspension of Project 997 and an order that the defendants refrain from entering the PEAEX. On the merits, the plaintiff requests (i) confirmation of the requests for an injunction; (ii) recognition of the right to the traditional territory; (iii) the annulment of Project 977 and the legal transactions derived from it; (iv) an order to prohibit the defendants from entering the territories; (v) a declaration that the Public Utility Decree issued by the Municipality of Portel is null and void; (vi) an order to pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$ 5,000,000.00 to be paid into the Eastern Amazon Fund in favour of the communities of the extractivist territories of Portel.",Whether there were established illegal carbon credit projects in extractivist lands areas in the Pará State.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230724_Public-Civil-Action-ACP-0806582-68.2023.8.14.0015-_petition.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/public-defenders-office-of-the-state-of-para-vs-rmdlt-property-group-and-others-project-997-carbon-credits-and-forest-carbon-grabbing/

The plaintiff claims that 190,960 ha (hectares) of native Cerrado forest were cleared at the Pedra Chata Piranhas farm without prior authorization from the competent environmental agency. It highlights the great importance of the Cerrado and that the advance of illegal deforestation of the biome contributes to the climate crisis. According to remote sensing images, the plaintiff claims that the area continues to be exploited (even though it has been embargoed by IBAMA), without regeneration measures having been adopted. It argues that the defendants are civilly liable for the specific environmental damage caused by the irregular suppression of native forest in the Cerrado and the existence of resulting environmental damage that includes damage to fauna, soil, climate and biodiversity, among other harmful consequences related to deforestation. Several measures to secure the prohibition of further exploitation of the deforested area are requested as an injunction. In a definitive manner, it is requested that the defendants be ordered to (i) recover an area corresponding to the deforested one, (ii) pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$1,442,320.88, (iii) pay for the transitory and residual damage caused to ecological heritage, in addition to compensation for the economic profit obtained illegally, including climate damage.",Restoration for environmental and climate damage caused by deforestation in the Cerrado.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180911_ACP-no-1006451-96.2023.4.01.3704_petition-1.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/ibama-vs-minerva-ribeiro-de-barros-e-genesisagro-s-a/
ASA Ruling on 4Air LLC,2023,,Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","United Kingdom, Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)","United Kingdom, UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing","4AIR describes itself as a “sustainability solutions program dedicated to aviation”.
In November 2022, a paid-for Google ad for 4AIR was seen which stated, “Eco-Friendly Aviation – Future of Sustainable Aviation” and “Learn How To Turn Flying Into A Force For Good With A 4AIR Rating. Industry-Leading Standard For Sustainability In Private Aviation. Sustainability. Aviation Industry.”
The Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) challenged whether the ad gave a misleading impression of the environmental impact of the service.
By ruling of August 30, 2023, the ASA upheld the challenge.
The CAP Code required that absolute environmental claims be supported by a high level of substantiation.
The claims “Eco-Friendly Aviation”, “Sustainable Aviation” and “Turn Flying Into A Force For Good” would be understood by businesses to mean that 4AIR offered services that could ensure aviation operations did not cause environmental damage. Businesses would also understand from the claims that, by using 4AIR’s services, their business would be capable of having an immediate positive impact on the environment.
The ASA therefore expected to see a high level of evidence that substantiated the claims, taking into account the full life cycle of the products and services associated with 4AIR’s services. Given those services were directly linked with aviation, that that meant the full life cycle of aviation operations, even though 4AIR did not itself operate aircraft.
Aviation, even with the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, produced high levels of CO2 and non-CO2 emissions which contributed to climate change. Further, the results of research into future aircraft technologies would not be delivered until decades into the future. Support of such an initiative via 4AIR was not therefore adequate substantiation to evidence the claim “Turn Flying Into A Force For Good” as it would be understood in context.
Further, there were no initiatives or commercially viable technologies within the aviation industry which would adequately substantiate absolute claims such as “Eco-friendly Aviation” and “Sustainable Aviation” as businesses would interpret them in context.
The claims were therefore likely to mislead businesses in relation to 4AIR’s capability to ensure that aviation operations which purchased its services did not negatively impact the environment. The ad therefore breached the Code.
The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again in the form complained about. The ASA told 4AIR to ensure it did not mislead businesses by understating the environmental impact of their service, including by using absolute claims such as “Eco-Friendly Aviation”, “Sustainable Aviation”, and “Turn Flying Into A Force For Good”.
This Ruling formed part of a wider piece of work on climate change and the environment. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA’s Active Ad Monitoring system, which used AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules",Whether a paid-for Google ad for 4AIR LLC misleadingly understated the environmental impact of their service.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230830_21489_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/asa-ruling-on-4air-llc/
Survival International Italia (on behalf of Ayoreo Totobiegosode Indigenous People) v. Pasubio (Italian company in the leather sector),2022,,Pending,,"OECD, Italy National Contact Point","International Law, OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises","On December 13, 2022, the NGO Survival International filed a complaint with the Italian National Contact Point of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) arguing that Pasubio – an Italian leather company that supplies renowned automotive firms including BMW and Land Rover – has violated the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Pasubio is sourcing leather from cattle ranching firms that operate within the forests inhabited by the Ayoreo Totobiegosode in the Gran Chaco area of Paraguay. The Ayoreo Totobiegosode are the only indigenous people living in voluntary isolation in the Americas outside the Amazon rainforest. According to the applicant, the activities of the cattle farms contribute to the deforestation of the Ayoreo lands and the violation of their human rights. Although climate change is not the main issue at the centre of the case, the specific instance explicitly addresses the link between deforestation activity and the climate emergency (p 49). Deforestation affects the natural GHG emissions absorption capacity, accelerating global warming. The complaint also mentions the Glasgow Forest Pledge, under which several multinational companies have pledged to reduce their deforestation impact. The allegations are based on, among other things, two reports by the NGO Earthsight.","Whether Pasubio violated the OECD Guidelines by sourcing leather from cattle farms operating in Ayoreo lands, contributing to their illegal deforestation.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221213_22209_complaint.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/survival-international-italia-on-behalf-of-ayoreo-totobiegosode-indigenous-people-v-pasubio-italian-company-in-the-leather-sector/

The plaintiffs seek the suspension and subsequent annulment of the environmental licensing process of the Portocem Thermoelectric Plant (UTE), powered by natural gas, which is to be installed in the Pecém Industrial and Port Complex (CIPP). They claim there is non-compliance with legal norms and several omissions in the Environmental Impact Study (EIA), including (i) the concealment of indigenous communities in the vicinity of the project, (ii) the disregard of impacts related to water resources, (iii) the disregard of potential socioeconomic impacts, (iv) the underestimation of damage to health, and (v) the disregard of climate impacts. They also believe that there was no adequate analysis of synergistic and cumulative impacts with other enterprises in the region, considering their insertion in an Industrial Complex. In relation to climate impacts, the plaintiffs argue that the EIA failed to list important consequences for climate stability. They mention the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and how the use of fossil fuels is incompatible with the guiding principles of the national energy policy. They argue that Brazil and the state of Ceará have made a legal commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which goes against the implementation of a new gas-fired thermoelectric plant.

They claim that the project’s emissions intensity (estimated at 860-880g CO2/kWh) is of an unacceptably high level by international standards, and would generate twice as much CO2 per unit of power generated as the average electricity generating plant in Vietnam. In addition they allege that banks were made aware about the environmental impacts of the project, but there is no evidence that they took any steps to influence their client to disclose additional environmental information or to implement additional mitigation measures that would reduce the project’s emissions. Further, they failed to adequately consult communities that were affected by the coal-fired power stations.",Complaint against funding of coal mines in Vietnam by Japanese Banks,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180918_11361_complaint.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180918_11361_complaint-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180918_11361_complaint-2.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210115_11361_na.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210115_11361_na-2.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/market-forces-v-smbc-mufg-and-mizuho/

The plaintiff argued that fires occurred inside the defendant’s concessions area and caused damages to peatlands and ecosystem within. The MoEF claimed that the defendant had deliberately burned the peatlands with the intention of using it for plantation purposes. Moreover, neither the fire early warning system nor the detection system in the defendant’s concessions area met the requirements, a fact which the plaintiff used as proof of omissions. The MoEF mentioned that fires inside the defendant’s concessions had caused ecological and economic damages. For these damages, the MoEF requested compensation as high as IDR 243,291.006,270 for the damages and restoration costs. For climate-related damages, the MoEF claimed that the fires had contributed to the release of 4366.98 tC and a loss of function of carbon sinks which equal to 1528 tC.

ASA Ruling on Shell UK Ltd (following a complaint by Adfree Cities),2023,,Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","United Kingdom, Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)","United Kingdom, UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing","This ruling concerned a poster, a TV ad, and a YouTube ad for Shell. The poster was seen in Bristol in June 2022. It featured in large text “BRISTOL is READY for Cleaner Energy” and included Shell’s logo. The TV and YouTube ads, also seen in June 2022, depicted some of Shell’s business activities in 2022 and focused on more environmentally friendly energy products.
Adfree Cities challenged whether the ads were misleading.
By ruling of June 7, 2023, the Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) upheld that complaint.
Consumers were increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of activities related to higher-carbon products and services, and would be interested in seeking out businesses, including oil and gas companies, that were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services. However, they were unlikely to be aware of the details of this in relation to specific companies, and ads were therefore likely to mislead consumers if they misrepresented the contribution that lower-carbon initiatives played, or would play in the near future, as part of the overall balance of a company's activities.
In the absence of qualifying information, the cumulative effect of the ads was to give the impression that low-carbon energy products comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Shell invested in and sold in the UK in 2022, or were likely to do so in the near future.
Shell said they were taking steps towards net zero and promoting sustainable energy. However, according to Shell’s 2021 Sustainability Report, its operations gave rise to greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 that were estimated as equivalent to 1,375 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Large-scale oil and gas investment and extraction comprised the vast majority of the company’s business model in 2022 and would continue to do so in the near future. Because the ads gave the overall impression that a significant proportion of Shell’s business comprised lower-carbon energy products, further information about the proportion of Shell’s overall business model that comprised lower-carbon energy products was material information that should have been included. Because the ads did not include such information, they omitted material information and were likely to mislead.
The ASA ruled that the ads must not appear again in the form complained of. The ASA told Shell to ensure their future ads featuring environmental claims did not mislead by exaggerating or, omitting material information about, the proportion of their business activities that were comprised of lower carbon activities.
A related complaint, concerning the use by UK households of renewable electricity from Shell, was not upheld.","Whether a poster, a TV ad, and a YouTube ad for Shell misleadingly omitted material information about the proportion of their business activities that were comprised of lower carbon activities.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230607_21511_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/asa-ruling-on-shell-uk-ltd-following-a-complaint-by-adfree-cities/

The plaintiff claims that 489,0545 ha (hectares) of native Cerrado forest were cleared at the Jatobá farm without prior authorization from the competent environmental agency. It highlights the great importance of the Cerrado and that the advance of illegal deforestation of the biome contributes to the climate crisis. According to remote sensing images, the plaintiff claims that the area continues to be exploited (even though it has been embargoed by IBAMA), without regeneration measures having been adopted. It argues that the defendants are civilly liable for the specific environmental damage caused by the irregular suppression of native forest in the Cerrado and the existence of resulting environmental damage that includes damage to fauna, soil, climate and biodiversity, among other harmful consequences related to deforestation. Several measures to secure the prohibition of further exploitation of the deforested area are requested as an injunction. In a definitive manner, it is requested that the defendants be ordered to (i) recover an area corresponding to the deforested one, (ii) pay collective moral damages in the amount of R$3.693.828,63, (iii) pay for the transitory and residual damage caused to ecological heritage, in addition to compensation for the economic profit obtained illegally, including climate damage.",Restoration for environmental and climate damage caused by deforestation in the Cerrado.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180911_ACP-no-1012550-40.2023.4.01.4300_petition-1.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/ibama-vs-brandao-e-jovino/

Specifically, the complaint highlights that ENI has committed to net zero emissions by 2050, but its actions run contrary to this goal. For example, ENI plans to increase its oil production by 4% each year until at least 2024, and is proposing to rely on large amounts of negative emissions technology (7 million tonnes of CO2 stocked each year by 2030). The complaint alleges that ENI has not complied with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises due to: (i) the fact that the company's strategic plan does not foresee a sufficient cut in GHG emissions in the coming years; (ii) the lack of a climate impact assessment of the company's activities; (iii) the absence of transparent and adequate information; and (iv) the failure to develop a plan for risk prevention and mitigation.

A footnote at the bottom of the ad stated, “Equinor has been delivering energy solutions to the UK for 40 years, and we are now working to help the UK achieve a smooth energy transition […] we’re producing the oil and gas the UK needs now; and will be powering millions more homes with wind, capturing and storing carbon safely […]. It’s broad energy for a brighter future”. The relevant advertising code stated that unqualified environmental claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. The ad appeared in The Economist magazine, which was read by consumer and business readers, as well as politicians and public policy professionals. The Advertising Standards Authority, therefore, considered members of those groups as the ad’s likely audience. While the ad was not for a directly purchasable product or service, the ASA considered it was likely to raise Equinor’s profile and influence readers’ opinions of Equinor as a brand by increasing awareness of their activities and plans in the UK. However, ads were likely to mislead if they exaggerated the contribution that lower-carbon initiatives played, or would play in the near future, as part of the overall balance of a company's activities when making claims about green initiatives. The claim “Wind, oil, gas, carbon capture” gave equal prominence to each activity. It was likely to be interpreted to mean that carbon capture and energy sourced from windfarms formed a significant proportion of Equinor’s current and near future activities, alongside oil and gas.","Whether advertising claims by an energy company about its various activities related to wind, oil and gas power, and to carbon capture, were likely to mislead.",No case documents are available.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/asa-ruling-on-equinor-asa/

ON THE WAY. ARE YOU?"" The complainant alleged that Shell's statement on CO2 neutrality was misleading, referring to Shell's inaction on reducing CO2 emissions and the nature of Shell's business. The complainant referred to the District Court of the Hague's judgment on May 26, 2021 in Milieudefensie et al. v. Royal Dutch Shell plc. to highlight Shell's intentions. The complainant also argued that the rainforest wrongly suggested that Shell helped with the preservation of the rainforest. Shell, on the other hand, argued that it used carbon offsetting to reach carbon neutrality. Shell also argued that the ""I"" referred to the displayed truck, and not the company as a whole. Lastly, Shell stated that the rainforest was an example of the CO2 compensation programs. The RCC held that the slogan could be interpreted in various ways, and that it was unclear that it only referred to the truck. The RCC considered the slogan to be misleading as the cargo (fossil fuel) and the company itself were not CO2 neutral. Thus, the RCC considered the advertisement to be in breach of article 2 of the Code for Environmental Advertising. In its ruling, the RCC referred to the reasoning of the RCC's Ruling on Shell ""Drive CO2 neutral"" 1.",Whether Shell's advertisement on Shell's truck is misleading because it implies that Shell is CO2 neutral.,No case documents are available.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/rcc-ruling-on-shell-drive-co2-neutral-2/

The Supreme Court of British Columbia found that the defendants had defamed Dr. Weaver and that their statements were not protected by the defense of fair comment because the facts upon which they relied were false. The Court awarded Dr. Weaver $50,000 in general damages, and directed the defendants to remove the offending articles, require third parties to cease republication, and publish a retraction.","Injunction against newspaper for publishing false, malicious, defamatory words",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2012/20120212_2015-BCSC-165_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/weaver-v-corcoran-and-others/

RCC Ruling on Chiquita “climate neutral bananas”,2022,2022/00296,Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","Netherlands, Reclame Code Commissie (RCC)","Netherlands, Code for Environmental Advertising, Article 2","The contested advertising concerned a sticker on Chiquita's bananas which included the statement ""CO2 Neutral."" The complaint alleged that Chiquita's ""CO2 Neutral"" claim was not true. Several statements were pointed out on Chiquita's website which referred to CO2 emission reduction by 30 percent by the end of 2030. The Commission found the sticker on the bananas with the claim ""CO2 Neutral"" to be misleading pursuant to article 2 of the Code for Environmental Advertising (MRC), as it did not contain any reference to information about the interpretation of this claim. Because any context was lacking, the meaning of this claim was unclear to the average consumer. The Committee noted that the meaning of the environmental claim had had to be made clear in the advertisement. The Committee found it insufficient that the meaning of ""CO2 Neutral"" was clarified on a separate website. It also noted that the mere mention of a website was insufficient to make the meaning of the claim clear. Because the claims were admissible on the basis of the foregoing, the Committee did not have to examine the question whether Chiquita was able to demonstrate the correctness of its absolute environmental claim pursuant to article 3 MRC. However, the Committee did refer to the strict standards set out in previous rulings.","Whether Chiquita's advertising of its bananas as ""CO2 neutral"" was misleading.",No case documents are available.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/rcc-ruling-on-chiquita-climate-neutral-bananas/

The Belgian National Bank has participated in the European Central Bank's Corporate Sector Purchase Program (CSPP), in which six national central banks purchase bonds from eligible companies to improve financing conditions by lowering debt costs. ClientEarth alleges that over half of bonds purchased under the CSPP were issued by greenhouse-gas intensive sectors and that the program, therefore, exacerbates the climate crisis. ClientEarth alleges that the Belgian National Bank's participation in the CSPP, by not taking into account climate, environment, and human rights impacts, violated Article 11 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and Article 37 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (both concern the obligation to integrate environmental protection into EU policies). As part of its case, ClientEarth sought a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice to determine whether the decision to establish the CSPP was lawful; it argues that it was not because of the failure to take into account climate considerations in designing the CSPP as required by EU law, because the CSPP is itself inconsistent with EU climate policy, and become it undermines the European Union's emissions reduction targets.",Whether the Belgian National Bank's purchasing of bonds from fossil fuel companies violated EU law.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221129_2138C_press-release.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/clientearth-v-belgian-national-bank/
Sendai Citizens v.

The plaintiffs argued that the operation of the Sendai Power Station violated (i) their personal rights to life, health, and bodily integrity (Jinkaku-ken) due to the health damage caused by the emission of environmental pollutants, (ii) their personal rights to life, health, and bodily integrity due to climate change, and (iii) the right to maintain biodiversity due to the emission of hazardous substances. Firstly, the plaintiffs argued that the emissions of pollutants, such as SOx and NOx, caused significant health damage by increasing the risks of various illnesses. Secondly, the plaintiffs argued that their personal rights were violated as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would worsen climate change, which causes extreme events, such as heat waves and heavy rains. To support this argument, they stated that the current use of coal-fired power plants was incompatible with the GHG emissions reduction targets in Japan and was also an obstacle to the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement.

ClientEarth v. Shell’s Board of Directors,2023,[2023] EWHC 1137 (Ch); [2023] EWHC 1897 (Ch); [2023] EWHC 2182 (Ch),Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, GHG emissions reduction","United Kingdom, England and Wales, High Court of Justice","United Kingdom, 2006 Companies Act","ClientEarth held shares in Shell Plc and was therefore a member of Shell. In that capacity it applied for permission to bring a derivative claim against Shell’s directors under section 260 of the Companies Act 2006. The claim concerned Shell’s climate change risk management strategy, as well as its response to the Milieudefensie v Royal Dutch Shell plc ruling.
In respect of these, ClientEarth alleged the directors had breached their general duties to promote the success of Shell (section172) and to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence (section 174), along with certain specific or ‘incidental’ duties formulated by ClientEarth (such as a duty to make judgements regarding climate risk that are based upon a reasonable consensus of scientific opinion). The various alleged breaches of these duties were grouped by the court under the following headings: failure to set an appropriate emissions target; failure of the strategy to manage climate risk to establish a reasonable basis for achieving the net zero target and align with the 1.5oC; and failure to comply with the Milieudefensie ruling.
The court’s permission is required to continue a derivative claim of this nature. An application for permission cannot proceed if it appears to the court that it does not show a prima facie case for giving permission. On May 12, 2023, having reviewed the case papers, the High Court dismissed ClientEarth’s application on the basis no such prima facie case had been shown. ClientEarth exercised its right for that decision to be reconsidered at a hearing, following which the High Court re-affirmed its original decision, refusing permission and dismissing the claim. The court’s reasons are set out in its judgment of July 24, 2023. In summary:
There were a number of fundamental reasons why the breaches alleged did not establish a prima facie case. Firstly, very little weight could be given to ClientEarth’s witness evidence, which did not amount to expert evidence. Secondly, that evidence did not support a prima facie case that there is a universally accepted methodology as to the means by which Shell might be able to achieve its reductions targets. This meant it was very difficult to treat what was said as providing a proper evidential basis for alleging no reasonable board of directors could properly conclude that the pathway to achievement is the one they adopted. Thirdly, ClientEarth accepted the directors do have policies and targets to achieve net zero. Its case ignored the fact that the management of a business of the size and complexity of that of Shell will require the directors to take into account a range of competing considerations, the proper balancing of which is classic management decision with which the court is ill-equipped to interfere. (Judgment paragraphs 46 to 48.)
As to the Milieudefensie ruling, the Dutch court apparently accepted that Shell is not currently acting in an unlawful manner and recognised that it is a matter for Shell as to how it exercises its discretion to comply with reduction obligations imposed by Dutch law. There was no prima facie case that the directors had breached their duties in respect of the Dutch order. (Paragraphs 49 to 54.)
As to the relief sought, ClientEarth had failed to make out a prima facie case that the court should grant this. A mandatory injunction was sought that Shell (a) adopt and implement a strategy to manage climate risk in compliance with its statutory duties and (b) comply immediately with the Dutch Order. This was too imprecise to be suitable for enforcement. A declaration was also sought - that the directors had breached their duties in the manner described. Whilst this did not suffer from imprecision, it was difficult to see what legitimate purpose it would fulfil. It was not the court’s function to express views as to the directors’ conduct which have no substantive effect and which fulfil no legally relevant purpose. The proper forum for generating those types of view as to the directors’ conduct was by vote of the members in general meeting. (Paragraphs 55 to 59.)
It was appropriate also to have regard to certain discretionary factors in section 263 of the Act. These pointed towards there being no prima facie case for granting permission. (paragraphs 60 to 70.)
In a costs judgment of August 31, 2023 the High Court confirmed its refusal of ClientEarth’s application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. In November 2023 the Court of Appeal refused ClientEarth permission to appeal, bringing the litigation to an end.",Whether there was a prima facie case for permission to continue a derivative claim against Shell’s directors for breach of their duties in respect of the company’s climate strategy and its response to the Milieudefensie ruling.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230724_2023-EWHC-1137-Ch-2023-EWHC-1897-Ch-2023-EWHC-2182-Ch-_press-release.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230512_2023-EWHC-1137-Ch-2023-EWHC-1897-Ch-2023-EWHC-2182-Ch-_judgment.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230724_2023-EWHC-1137-Ch-2023-EWHC-1897-Ch-2023-EWHC-2182-Ch-_judgment.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230831_2023-EWHC-1137-Ch-2023-EWHC-1897-Ch-2023-EWHC-2182-Ch-_judgment.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20231115_2023-EWHC-1137-Ch-2023-EWHC-1897-Ch-2023-EWHC-2182-Ch-_na.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/clientearth-v-shells-board-of-directors/
ASA Ruling on Etihad Airways,2023,,Decided,"Suits against corporations, individuals, Corporations, Misleading advertising","United Kingdom, Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)","United Kingdom, UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing","This ruling concerned two paid for Facebook ads by Etihad Airways seen in October 2022.
The first claimed “… we’re taking a louder, bolder approach to sustainable aviation” in the body of the text, and “… you’ll earn Etihad Guest Miles every time you make a conscious choice for the planet … Environmental airline of the year” in the accompanying video. The second claimed “… we’re taking a louder, bolder approach to sustainable aviation” in the body of the text and “… we’re cutting back on single-use plastics and are flying the most efficient planes. Flights with a smaller footprint … Environmental airline of the year” in the accompanying video.
The Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) challenged whether the ads were misleading because they exaggerated the environmental benefits of flying with Etihad. By ruling of Apr. 12, 2023, the ASA upheld that challenge.
The CAP Code required that absolute environmental claims be supported by a high level of substantiation.
Etihad had commented that the claim “sustainable aviation” would be understood, especially in the aviation industry, as a long-term, multifaceted goal, which included their aspiration to reach “net zero” carbon emissions by 2050. However, the ads were aimed at the general public, and they did not mention Etihad’s desire to be “net-zero” by 2050 or position the claim “sustainable aviation” as a long-term aspiration.
Etihad had commented about the use of modern aircraft and flight practices to reduce emissions. However air travel continued to produce high levels of CO2 and non-CO2 emissions which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. Many of the initiatives Etihad said they were committed to delivering were targeted to only deliver results years or decades into the future. Further, initiatives such as reducing single use plastics and using more efficient aircraft were not adequate substantiation to evidence a ""sustainable aviation"" claim.
While steps were being taken by Etihad to reduce the environmental impact of its service, there were currently no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry which would adequately substantiate an absolute green claim such as “sustainable aviation” as we considered consumers would interpret it in this context.
The claim therefore exaggerated the impact that flying with Etihad would have on the environment and the ads breached the Code. Etihad was told to ensure that their ads did not give a misleading impression of the impact caused by travelling with the airline and that robust substantiation was held to support them.",Whether two Facebook ads for an airline made misleading environmental claims about the impact of flying.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230412_21499_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/asa-ruling-on-etihad-airways/
