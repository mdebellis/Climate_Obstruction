Recently, environmental and social issues including climate change have been key issues for smaller shareholders and silencing such dissenting voices can be valuable for companies, especially those involved in the fossil fuel industry.21Zachary Mider and Ben Elgin. “SEC Chairman Cites Fishy Letters in Support of Policy Change,”Bloomberg, November 19, 2019.\n“[A] close look at the seven letters Clayton highlighted, and about two dozen others submitted to theSECby supposedly regular people, shows they are the product of a misleading – and laughably clumsy – public relations campaign by corporate interests,”Bloombergreported.\nOne of the errors that gave away the campaign had been organized by corporate interests was the insertion of an out-of-context error in theSEC‘s mailing address. That error occurred in at least 20 letters purported to be submitted by ordinary Americans.\nSome of those contacted by Bloomberg said they had been contacted by a public affairs firm and had not written the letters themselves.\n“They wrote it, and I allowed them to use my name after I read it,” public servant Marie Reed said. “I didn’t go digging into all of this,” referring to her letter’s criticism of proxy advisers, a term she said she wasn’t familiar with when contacted.\nSome of the letters cited bySECChairman Jay Clayton included “ long-term Main Street investors, including an Army veteran and a Marine veteran, a police officer, a retired teacher, a public servant, a single mom, a couple of retirees who saved for retirement,” he said at a commission meeting in Washington.\nBloomberg summarized: “That retired teacher? Pauline Yee said she never wrote a letter, although the signature was hers. Those military vets? It turns out they’re the brother and cousin of the chairman of 60 Plus Association, a Virginia-based advocacy group paid by corporate supporters of theSECinitiative. That single mom? Data embedded in the electronically submitted letter says someone at 60 Plus wrote it. That retired couple? Their son-in-law runs 60 Plus.”\nOthers with their names on the letters included a woman who previously worked at 60 Plus’s accounting firm, a former secretary of 60 Plus, and a number of friends and relatives of 60 Plus president Saul Anuzis. None mentioned their affiliation with 60 plus.\nAnuzis acknowledged that 60 Plus had recruited submitters, provided drafts, and in two examples sent letters on members’ behalf. He also said he had received money from coalition members.\n“We don’t get paid for specific projects,” he said in an interview. “We get contributions from members who are part of the coalition. We’re not getting paid for a specific letter.”\nThe letters revealed potential ties to other groups working with the 60 Plus Association. Marie Reed, one of the names who had been cited by Clayton, said that the man who provided her letter said he worked atFSBCore Strategies, a California-based public relations firm.

Archive.isURL:https://archive.li/fIaYW\nThe poll was conducted byMWRStrategies, a lobbying firm whose clients have included Koch Industries and theAmerican Fuel&Petrochemical Manufacturers. The questions implant the idea that consumers are being pushed to buy certain vehicles and that taxpayers are being forced to pay for the federal programs that supportEVsales.76“Poll by Former Koch Lobbyist Skews Public Support for Clean Cars, Electric Vehicles,”DeSmog, June 20, 2018.\nFor example, one question states that every purchaser of an electric vehicle is paid “75 hundred dollars” by the “taxpayer,” which misrepresents the mechanics of the non-refundable electric vehicle tax credit. The tax credit simply lowers the buyer’s tax rate in the year of purchase — functionally the same way that a home mortgage interest deduction or child tax credit works.77“Poll by Former Koch Lobbyist Skews Public Support for Clean Cars, Electric Vehicles,”DeSmog, June 20, 2018.\nAnother question claims that the average income of an electric car buyer is $150,000, and then asks whether the respondent thinks it’s “fair” that the buyer should “be paid 75 hundred dollars.” As of 2016, 54 percent ofEVpurchasers have a household income above $100,000, not $150,000. Also not noted, nearly 80 percent ofEVs are leased rather than purchased, and only 38 percent of leases have a household income above $100,000.78“Poll by Former Koch Lobbyist Skews Public Support for Clean Cars, Electric Vehicles,”DeSmog, June 20, 2018.\nBelow is a sample of one split sample question, where the interviewer uses to different wordings to ask the same question:79“Poll by Former Koch Lobbyist Skews Public Support for Clean Cars, Electric Vehicles,”DeSmog, June 20, 2018.\nThe first question, set up to make respondents feel a direct personal sacrifice, 29 percent answered that this was “way too much” and 25 percent said it was “about right.” The second question, framed without the direct emotional connection, the percentage of respondents that said it was “about right” rose slightly to 27 percent, and those who said it was “way too much” dropped to 19 percent. Both wordings were misleading, considering a tax credit is not a payment from the government and not all buyers ofEVs get the full value of the tax credit.80“Poll by Former Koch Lobbyist Skews Public Support for Clean Cars, Electric Vehicles,”DeSmog, June 20, 2018.\nApril 23, 2018\nTheAEA, represented byThomas Pyle, was among 22 groups signed on to anopen letteraskingPresident Trumpto ignore recent criticism ofEPAAdministratorScott Pruitt.81“Coalition letter to the President on Scott Pruitt,”(PDF)Heartland Institute.

Jim Nussle (R-Iowa) and to Rick Santorum’s 2012 presidential campaign. It was founded withreported seed fundingfrom Bruce Rastetter, a co-founder and the chief executive of Hawkeye Energy Holdings, a large ethanol company in the United States.

Norm Coleman (R-MN) in March 2008. AsNPRreported in 2008: “American Future Fund advocates free-market policies.

TheFECfound that Sean Noble, who worked with the Kochs, had closely directed expenditures by the organizations in question, including picking which races individual ads would be run.[4]\n“That violated federal rules requiring organizations to identity [sic] the source of any money earmarked for a political expenditure, the commission determined,” wrote theNew York Times.[4]\nThe three groups agreed to pay over $200,000 in fines to settle the investigation but did not concede that they had broken any laws.[4]\nCitizens for Responsibility And Ethics in Washington (CREW) had initiallyfiled a complaintagainst the Koch nonprofit groups in 2014. As part of its conciliation agreement with theFEC, the American Future Fund agreed to pay $140,000.[5]\n“These rules provide some of the only windows into the funding of dark money groups, but theFECalmost never penalizes groups that break them,” said Noah Bookbinder,CREW‘s executive director. “It is hard to overstate how significant this is.”[5]",
    "Koch Ties": "As part of its in-depth investigation into the Koch network,The Washington Postpreviously reportedonAFF‘s role, describing it as “a Des Moines-based nonprofit that poured more than $25 million into ads against Obama and congressional Democrats in 2012.”[4],[6]\nThe New York Timesreported in 2016that the Koch brothers had cut ties with the American Future Fund.",

    "Background": "Atlas Network is a Washington, DC-based non-profit organization that describes itself as working to support a growing network of more than 500 “free market” organizations in nearly 100 countries promoting free market ideas.\nMany of the member think tanks of Atlas Network have supported climate science denial and have campaigned against legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe Atlas Economic Research Foundation (AERF) was founded by Antony Fisher in 1981 with the goal of spreading “innovative, market-based perspectives to issues of public policy” globally.\nIn 1955, Fisher hadfounded the Institute of Economic Affairs(IEA), after conferring with free-market economist F.A. Hayek. Fisher and Hayek were part of theMont Pelerin Society‘s early efforts. IEA became an influential London-based think tank promoting neoliberal ideas of limited government and low regulation.1“Our Story,”Atlas Economic Research Foundation. Archived August 11, 2015.

Previous names have been the Atlas Foundation and the Atlas Research Foundation. TheInternational Policy Network (IPN)in the UK, also founded by Fisher, is effectively a UK variant of Atlas Network.\nAccording to UK Charity Commission filings (PDF), The Atlas Economic Research Foundation (UK) was working as the International Policy Network, and is registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales, number 262982. In April 2001, with the consent of the Charity Commission, it adopted the working name of The International Policy Network, ‘IPN’, and in December 2004, ‘UK’ was added to the name.The UK Atlas Economic Research Foundation and the IPN UK are no longer listed among UK Charities. and the UK branch was most recently operating with a new name, “Network for a Free Society.” The U.S. Atlas Network appears to be a separate entity from the International Policy Network US Inc., although Atlas Network’s 2010financial recordsreveal that they continued to provide support to IPN.2“Network for a Free Society (previously Atlas Economic Research Foundation (UK) working as The International Policy Network UK) Annual Report and Financial Statements” (PDF),  Year ended 31 December 2010.

    "History": "The Cato Institute was originallyincorporated (PDF)on December 19, 1974, under the name “Charles Koch Foundation,” with the original directors listed as Charles Koch, George Pearson, and Roger MacBride.  It shared the same address as Koch Industries in Wichita, Kansas.5Charles Koch Foundation (later Cato Institute), Certificate of Incorporation,organizational founding document, originally filed December 19, 1974. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.\nAt the same time, George Pearson filed the organization’sapplication for nonprofit status with the IRS (PDF), anticipating initial contributions of $40,000 in funds from Charles Koch, the Fred C.

Koch Foundation, as well as 10,000 to 15,000 shares of non-voting common stock of Koch Industries, as well as potentially non-voting preferred stock.6“Application for Recognition of Exemption,” November, 1972.  Retrieved from the New Mexico Charitable Organizations Registrar. Archived .pdf on File at DeSmog.\nThe Cato Institute took on its current name in 1977.

    "Internal Conflict": "In 2012, the Koch Brothers and Ed Crane of the Cato Institute had a “bitter falling-out over management and philosophical differences.” The Koch Brothers, who controlled roughly half of the Cato Institute through “shareholder seats,” had decided to sue the Cato Institute to gain control over an additional seat of a shareholder who had died, which would give Koch majority control of the group.8Eric Lichtblau. “Cato Institute and Koch Brothers Reach Agreement,”The Caucus, June 25, 2012. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/B3G2e\nEd Crainreleased a written statementwhen the lawsuits were first filed:\n“Charles G. Koch has filed a lawsuit as part of an effort to gain control of the Cato Institute, which he co-founded with me in 1977. While Mr. Koch and entities controlled by him have supported the Cato Institute financially since that time, Mr. Koch and his affiliates have exercised no significant influence over the direction or management of the Cato Institute, or the work done here.”9Allen McDuffee and T.W. Farnam. “Koch Brothers sue Cato Institute, president,”The Washington Post, March 1, 2012. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/Ygjk9\nThe New York Times reportedthe Koch Brothers had long attempted to install their own people on the Cato Institute’s 16-member board, to establish a “more direct pipeline between Cato and the family’s Republican political outlets, including groups that Democrats complain have mounted a multimillion-dollar assault on President Obama.” This had caused tensions inside the governing structure, as Cato officials said this threatened their reputation for independent research.10Eric Lichtblau. “Cato Institute Is Caught in a Rift Over Its Direction,”The New York Times, March 6, 2012. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/QuHVd\nThe Kochs eventually relented on the condition that Ed Crane retire, who was later replaced by John Allison,reported the New Yorker. It also resulted in a revamp of the Cato’s organizational structure, which had based ownership on a share structure. David Koch would remain on the board, but not his brother Charles. Bruce Bartlett, conservative economist and historian, said that the Kochs are ”[P]utting in place a structure that will gradually erode Cato’s independence and move it closer to the American Enterprise Institute and Heritage Foundation.”11Jane Mayer. “The Kochs v. Cato: Winners and Losers,”The New Yorker, June 27, 2012. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/u11yD\nGreenpeacereported that before the attempted Koch takeover, Cato was seen as a “Relatively independent think tank, willing to criticize both democrat and republican administrations,” but that the Kochs had wanted “the power to fold Cato into their suite of other front groups, making it another Koch-controlled cog in the republican political machine.”12“Why the Koch brothers are cannibalizing the Cato Institute,”Greenpeace USA, March 20, 2012.

Archive URL:https://archive.ph/bQ7vs\nThecompany began inthe 1920s when, according to company lore, recent MIT graduateFred C. Kochdeveloped a better way to convert or “crack” heavy oil into gasoline. As Lisa Gravesnoted:\n“[I]n 1925, the 25-year old Koch formed the Winkler-Koch Engineering Company, with Lewis Winkler. After studying at Rice and MIT, the Texan-born Koch joined Winkler and another man in launching the company in Wichita.\n“Before that, Winkler had worked as the chief engineer at Universal Oil Products, a firm that held patents on the fuel processing methods developed by Jesse Dubbs. Before joining up with Koch, Winkler had helped Dubbs’ son, Carbon, install one of the first thermal “cracking” stills that used the pressure and heat process that Koch’s firm would later deploy with slight modification, according to the expert testimony of the chairman of MIT’s chemical engineering department, as noted in Dan Schulman’s “Sons of Wichita.” Ultimately, though, after a bribery scandal involving an appellate judge the verdict against the Koch firm would be overturned and Universal Oil Products’ successor firms would pay the company damages.\n“But back in 1929 – before the sudden stock market crash and nearly three years before the patent case went to trial  – Koch’s firm signed contracts to build cracking stills in the U.S.S.R.\n“The communist regime didn’t recognize intellectual property rights, but it did pay well.”\nJane Mayer, as detailed in her landmark bookDark Money, detailed how Soviet Leader Josef Stalin was not the only foreign strongman Koch profited handsomely from, while most Americans struggled after the stock market crashed and then President Roosevelt sought to wake the economy from the Great Depression. She documented how in the 1930s Koch had built a major airplace fuel refinery for Adolf Hitler as he threated neighboring states with war. That became the biggest refinery fueling the Luftwaffe as it bombed civilians in cities likeGuernica, before the Allies in WWII destroyed it.\nEventually in 1940, Fred Koch founded the Wood River Oil and Refining Company. After Fred Koch’s death in 1967, his son Charles Koch took control of the company. In 1967, Charles renamed the company Koch Industries, Inc. His brother, thelate David H. Koch, joined the company in 1971 and became a vice-president in 1978.4“History Timeline,”Koch Industries. Archived December 21, 2008.

    "Background": "The Mont Pelerin Society (MPS) was created in 1947 by the free market economist and philosopher Friedrich von Hayek and advocates “classical liberalism,” an ideology classified by small government and minimal regulation of business. It was named after the location of the group’s first meeting in Switzerland, and the group’s subsequent annual meetings have spanned the globe including Galapagos Islands, Prague (former Czech president Vaclav Klaus is a member), New York, Morocco, Tokyo, Sydney, Buenos Aires, and Stockholm. American economist Milton Friedman wasalso one of the founding membersof the Society.1Eamonn Butler.“A Short History of the Mont Pelerin Society” (PDF),Montpelerin.org. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.2George Monbiot. “How the neoliberals stitched up the wealth of nations for themselves,”The Guardian, August 28, 2007.Archived July 10, 2017. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/a9VLc\nThe 1995 book by the Liberty Fund,A History of the Mont Pelerin Society, describes the group as having “no demonstrably proven role in world affairs.” According to ashort history of the MPS writtenby the group’s Vice President Eamonn Butler, it has “no official views, formulates no policies, publishes no manifestos, aligns itself with no party, and accepts no political or public funding.” Butler adds that it engages primarily in what he describes as the “battle of ideas,” and that it “has done more than just keep liberal ideas alive; it has expanded and deepened liberal philosophy and spread liberal thought across the globe.”3Eamonn Butler.“A Short History of the Mont Pelerin Society” (PDF),Montpelerin.org. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.The Road from Mont Pelerin(Harvard University Press, 2009)describes MPS as a “directory of organized neoliberalism.”4Philip Mirowski and Dieter Plehwe (2009).The Road from Mont Pelerin. London, England. Harvard University Press.\nGiven this abstract “battle of ideas,” it can be difficult to accurately gauge the precise influence of the Mont Pelerin Society on policy. However, the group’s influence can be seen by the overlap between many of its members and their affiliation with some of the largest conservative think tank across the United States, and around the world. DeSmog research found that Mont Pelerin Society members are affiliated with over 100 organizations thatalso appear on the membership listof theAtlas Network,5“Global Directory,” Atlas Network.

According toDeSmogresearch, Mont Pelerin members have ties to a wide range of conservative think tanks, many which have consistently denied the human influence on climate change. Some of the top groups tied to MPS through affiliations of its members include theCato Institute,The Hoover Institution, theHeritage Foundation, theReason Foundation, theFoundation for Economic Education, theAmerican Enterprise Institute, theCentre for the New Europe,George Mason University,Fraser Institute,Mercatus Center (George Mason University), and theHeartland Institute.\nMembership lists obtained byDeSmogdating to 2010and, more recently, 2013 show that organizations represented by the MPS have deep ties to the Koch network. Charles Koch himself is a long-standing member of the Society.DeSmogdug into individual member affiliations, and found that Koch foundations have poured more than $100 million into at least 54 groups connected to individual MPS members.8“Mont Pelerin Society A Window Into Ideological Heart Of Kochtopus Climate Denial,”DeSmog, January 27, 2014.",

    "Background": "The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)describes itself as the largest manufacturing association in the United States and claims to represent “small and large manufacturers in every industrial sector and in all 50 states” by working “on the front lines of a wide range of policy battles, from immigration reform and labor relations, to energy and the environment, to trade policy and taxes.”1“About,”National Association of Manufacturers.

In the 1990s version ofGCC, its first chairman would be the director of government relations for the Phillips Petroleum Company. Exxon was also a founding member, and on theGCCboard, whileAPIalso served as a leading member of the coalition.7David L. Levy and Sandra Rothenberg.“Corporate Strategy and Climate Change: Heterogeneity and Change in the Global Automobile Industry” (PDF), ENRP Discussion Paper E-99-13, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.\nAccording toGCC‘s mission statement, it was established to “coordinate business participation in the international policy debate on the issue of global climate change and global warming.” A 1993 press release saidGCCwas organized “as the leading voice for industry on the global climate change issue.”8“The Global Climate Coalition” (Homepage),Global Climate Coalition.

    "Air Quality Standards Coalition": "TheNAMcoordinatedAir Quality Standards Coalition (AQSC), a groupformed in 1996to opposing new air quality standards regulations proposed by theEPA. The group, headed byC. Boyden Gray,came to represent more than 500 members includingTexaco,Teneco,Philip Morris,Chevron, andMonsanto. In 1997, the group spent $100 million in attempts to combat rules that theEPAestimated would save 15,000 lives a year.11“EPA Clashes with Industry,”The Detroit News, February 7, 1999. Retrieved from Greenpeace Investigations.\nWriting at The New Republic,Hanna Rosin reported that “[t]he group has been trying to woo the National Governors’ Association since its newly chosen chairman, Ohio Governor George Voinovich, came out against the proposedEPAruling.

They got the American Petroleum Institute to agree to match all donations up to $600,000. Keeping up the appearance of a grass-roots effort by employingCSEis in fact crucial to the coalition. ‘NAMhas recognized that re environmental issues, while the war will be won or lost in Washington, the battles will take place out there,’ says one member, according to the notes.”14“SHADES OF GRAY,”The New Republic, April 14, 1997.
