AAUnited Kingdom,,,"The AAcallsair pollution a “worry for everyone, especially for those who live in urban areas or suffer from conditions like asthma”. It explains that “if someone has heart or lung issues and breathes in a lot of air pollution, their condition might become even more serious”.
On its website, it alsocitesa widely-reported joint study by the Royal College of Physicians andThe Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Healththat found around 40,000 deaths a year in the UK are linked to air pollution exposure.",,,,,"Birmingham: the AAcriticisedthe council in February 2020 for installing signs about the city’s Clean Air Zone, due to be implemented in the summer. An AA spokesman said it was “stupid and utterly confusing” for them to be put up before the scheme came into force and said the signs were “being used to scare people from coming into the city”.
The spokesman also criticised the planned CAZ itself, saying it would “discriminate against people who are less able to buy replacement vehicles” and claiming that “many pensioners will be hit”.
He also noted that some other cities are “only looking at charging the heavier polluters first – such as lorries, vans and taxis”.
An AA spokesperson told DeSmog it wanted to see more support provided to low-income households in Birmingham.
Bradford: the AA waslistedamong a number of organisations that the council would be meeting with to consult on plans for a charging CAZ in the city.
Bristol: the AAcriticisedproposals to ban private diesel cars from the city centre during the day, arguing: “diesel is the fuel used not only by ambulances, fire engines and buses but also essential services such as breakdown rescue, firms that make urgent deliveries such as to pharmacies, that unblock drains, plumbers and others that residents depend on.” Vans, buses and emergency vehicles arenot includedin the ban.
An AA spokesperson told DeSmog it did not make sense for a 12 year old petrol car to be able to drive into the city centre while modern diesel cars were not.
Leeds: the AA’s public affairs spokesman Luke Bosdetsuggestedthe city’s planned CAZ could amount to “congestion charging through the back door”. He also claimed the cost of maintaining the cameras used to enforce the charges could mean the council would “need to catch drivers to pay for their upkeep”.
London: the AAcriticisedplans to expand the city’s ULEZ from 2021. Its director of fleet and SME services said that “some businesses may struggle to budget for this radical step in terms of increased costs”, arguing that there was “too much stick and not enough carrot” in the plans.
An AA spokesperson told DeSmog that the organisation was “not wholly supportive” of an expanded ULEZ but declined to say what support measures would be sufficient for it to back the scheme.
Southampton: in a call for a nationwide diesel scrappage scheme, the AA’s Edmund King said diesel vehicles were “certainly not the only source” andgavethe example of moving ships docked in the city away from running on diesel generators and onto so-called “shore power”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The AA is the UK’s largest motoring organisation, with over 15 million members according to itswebsite. As well as providing breakdown cover, it also offers vehicle insurance, loans and motoring advice, among other services.
Although the AA has made public comments in support of air quality measures and been a vocal backer of electric vehicles, it has also strongly criticised proposed Clean Air Zones. It lays significant responsibility with the government for encouraging diesel cars and opposes what it calls the “demonisation” of diesel vehicles.
The AA’s President Edmund King has expressed concern about low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and other active travel measuresintroducedin 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but has been generally supportive of active travel measures.
The AAdescribesits public affairs team, which represents its members’ interests to policymakers, as the “most informed group of motoring experts in the UK”.
On its website, it states that “campaigning and lobbying are at the heart of our work” and lists “stopping fuel duty rises” among its campaigning successes.
Researchby Transport & Environment suggests that the UK’s 10-year freeze on fuel duty has encouraged car use and the purchase of less efficient vehicles such as SUVs. The organisation estimates that increasing fuel duty in line with inflation would have reduced CO2 emissions by 5.33 million tonnes per year long-term, equivalent to taking 2.5 million cars off the road.
The AA’s President represents the organisation on the government’sMotorists’ Forum, which brings together road transport-related trade associations and campaign groups with the government to discuss priorities.",,,,"However, it has been critical of plans for charging Clean Air Zones in the most polluted UK cities. In anexplanationon its website of these schemes, the AA argues that “charges and fines only go so far, especially if drivers feel they’re being punished unnecessarily.”
It makes a number of recommendations for how drivers can reduce their own emissions, which it says is where “real change” occurs. These include avoiding “idling”, lowering your speed, walking or cycling for shorter journeys, and keeping your car in good condition.
Although experts agree these measures can help reduce air pollution, organisations such as the British Lung Foundationarguecharging Clean Air Zones are the “most effective and quickest way to reach legal limits”.Researchby the Centre for Cities shows that schemes like London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone have cut NO2 concentrations significantly.
Ahead of the 2020 Budget, the organisationargueddrivers were confused by the UK’s clean air policies as a result of councils setting up “vastly different” Clean Air Zones and said this was encouraging drivers to stick with “older, more polluting cars”.
In 2019, the AA’s President Edmund Kingarguedthat CAZ schemes could lead to HGVs being replaced by multiple vans, causing more congestion and pollution. He said that a minor increase in van traffic in recent years “provides insight into how freight companies might be changing their fleets in the wake of CAZ”.
In 2017, the AAsaidit was “pleased” that a government consultation on CAZs “makes it clear that such schemes must be a policy of last resort rather than introduced by default”. It also claimed a majority of drivers view charging zones as “money-making schemes”.
Speaking to DeSmog, an AA spokesperson said the organisation did not oppose CAZs as long as they had been through a proper review process but said they were not a “silver bullet”.",,,"The AAnoteson its website that diesel vehicles “produce lots of soot (particulate matter) that can cause respiratory problems and contribute to the risk of cardiovascular diseases”. It acknowledges that while modern diesels have to be fitted with a “Diesel Particulate Filter”, and that there is an aim for an “80% cut in particle emissions”, the technology is “not without problems” and the AA’s “patrols are often called to cars with a blocked DPF”.
Elsewhere, it acknowledges that “diesel exhausts aren’t as clean as the standards, which new cars have to meet before they go on sale, predicted they should be”.
It nevertheless claims diesel vehicles are “still the best choice for many” and that there has been a “’demonisation’ of diesel in the press”.
In 2018, it jointly commissioned areportwith BT Fleet Solutions, a vehicle maintenance and leasing company, that found vehicle fleet managers were frustrated with “anti-diesel rhetoric”. It also criticised the government’s “potentially fragmented clean air policy”, with schemes being decided at the local level.
It has also frequentlyblamedprevious governments’ support for diesel vehicles as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions for contributing to the air pollution problem.
AA President Edmund King hascriticisedthe “dash for diesel” that occurred under Tony Blair’s Labour government and claimed that many of the people who purchased diesel cars live in suburban areas and are now “finding that they could be clobbered by low emissions zones or extra parking charges”.
On National Clean Air Day in 2017, the AAcalledfor a national diesel scrappage scheme in its submission to a government consultation on air quality, among a range of other measures.
The same year, the Kingsaid“demonising” diesel cars was “the easy position to take”, arguing the technology “still has an important role to play in transport and services”. He claimed that the latest Euro 6 diesel models produce “less NOx than a 10-15 year-old petrol car”, so some air quality schemes were illogical.
Researchon cars’ “real-world” emissions published by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2018foundthat Euro 6 diesel vehicles had significantly higher NOx emissions than petrol equivalents and exceeded emissions limits.
The AA has alsocriticisedgovernment plans to bring the ban on new diesel, petrol and hybrid cars from 2040 to 2035 or earlier. It called them “stretched targets” and said they were “incredibly challenging”, doubting whether there would be “sufficient supply of a full cross section of zero-emissions vehicles in less than fifteen years”.",,,,"Following the 2020 Budget, the AApraiseda new £900m research and development fund for electric vehicles but said the Chancellor could have been “bolder” by removing VAT on EVs, which the AA had beencalling for.
The AA’s President Edmund King alsosaidin January 2020 that “making it easier to swap a petrol or diesel car for an electric car needs to be at the forefront of the Budget”, calling for a large increase in rapid charging points and support for new EV battery “gigafactories”.
King has alsomadepositive comments about EVs publicly, telling a conference in 2018 that there needed to be a “more concerted effort by us all to sell the benefits of electric vehicles” and dispel some of the “myths”.
He has also tried to allay concerns about EVs’ range,notingin 2017 that 300 charging points were being added every month and arguing that EVs are “capable of meeting many people’s weekly, let alone daily, mileage on a single charge”.",,,,,,,,"The AA has been a long-time opponent of any increases in fuel duty. Reacting to the 2020 Budget, the AAsaidit was “pleased the Chancellor has listened to our calls to maintain the freeze in fuel duty” and called its £27bn investment in roads “fantastic news”.
Researchby Transport & Environment suggests that the ten-year freeze on fuel duty has encouraged car use and the purchase of less efficient vehicles such as SUVs. The organisation estimates that increasing fuel duty in line with inflation would have reduced CO2 emissions by 5.33 million tonnes per year long-term, equivalent to taking 2.5 million cars off the road.",,"The AA’s revenue in 2018 was £979m, according to itsannual report. Its roadside assistance branch recorded revenue of £841m, with 3.21m “paid personal members” and 9.79m business customers. Revenue from its insurance business was £138m.","The AA has frequently defended hybrids as an important “transition” technology between pure combustion engines and EVs. Its President hascalledplug-in hybrids a “positive stepping-stone to full EVs”.
Reacting to the news that the sale of new hybrid vehicles could also be banned from 2035, along with petrol and diesel cars, the AA’s Edmund Kingsaidmanufacturers were “spending billions on developing state-of-the-art hybrids which are zero emissions for many journeys”. He called it a “very backward step that could backfire by encouraging drivers to hold on to older more polluting vehicles”.
Hybrids have beencriticisedby environmental campaigners because their emissions savings can be quickly wiped out by driving in petrol or diesel mode, while “extended-range” electric vehicles can arguably offer the same benefits in terms of mileage.",,,"January 2021
Speaking toThe Independent, AA President Edmund Kingstatedthat people should cycle more, walk more, and drive less as the country returns to normal after the pandemic. “You can walk, you can cycle. And one of the good things during lockdown is seeing far more people cycling”.
He continued:
“So when this all passes, hopefully some of us can think about not being so dependent on the car and using the best means for the best journey. Often that’s using two feet or two wheels.”
King also noted that multi-car households could decline and that “many people could relatively easily switch to electric”.
September 2020
In September 2020, Kingwrotea letter to Secretary of State for Transport, Grant Shapps, stating that active travel schemes, which include low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), were “regrettably adding to congestion and poorer air quality rather than improving them”.
August 2020
In response to emergency active travel measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, including low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), Kingwarnedthat the return of the school run “could see localised gridlock with limited public transport, more cars and less road space due to ‘pop-up’ closures.”

Kingwarnedin August 2020 that the return of the school run “could see localised gridlock with limited public transport, more cars and less road space due to ‘pop-up’ closures”.
In July 2020, in response to emergency active travel measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, Kingstatedthat councils should not be afraid to review and roll back active travel schemes, including LTNs and pop-up cycle lanes, if they had “unintended consequences such as increased congestion and delivery restrictions on local businesses who are desperate to bounce back and aid the economic recovery”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.desmog.com/air-pollution-aa/,,,https://www.desmog.com/air-pollution-lobbying-database/
Alliance of British DriversUnited Kingdom,,,"The ABD has frequently denied or downplayed the environmental impacts of fossil fuel-powered cars, with a 2004 Guardian articlereportingthat the ABD disputed both anthropogenic climate change and the harm of exhaust emissions at the time.
The ABD currentlyclaimson its website that medical experts have said there is “no evidence” that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is “harmful to public health” because if it was “there would be a health warning on gas cookers”.
It has alsoclaimedthat UK efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would have “negligible impact” globally and said “many people do not accept” that CO2 is a major cause of climate change.
Elsewhere, it hassaidit is “unclear whether NOx actually has any negative health impacts” anddismisseda paper published in the Lancet medical journal linking childhood asthma to air pollution as “epidemiological guesswork” and “bad science”.
The ABD states on itswebsitethat “road transport is being attacked on environmental grounds”. It claims that “air pollution from private cars has been falling substantially and technology is going to make matters even better over the next few years”.
It says transport emissions are “only a fraction of total air pollutants, and those from private cars an even smaller factor”. It argues that “unreasonable and unnecessary attacks on car usage will not solve any environmental problems”.",,,,,"Bath: the ABDwrotea joint letter to the council opposing plans for a CAZ with theRoad Haulage Association, the anti-fuel duty campaign groupFairFuel UK, and theTaxPayers’ Alliance. The letter argued a CAZ could cause a decline in tourism and increase costs for taxis, coach companies and hauliers, leading to job losses and businesses “going bust”. It also stated that CAZs had been “shown to be ineffective, economically damaging and regressive” and suggested a tram system could be a better solution to tackling air pollution.
Birmingham: Paul Biggs, the group’s West Midlands spokesman, hassaidthat “eco-austerity policies” like the city’s planned Clean Air Zone are “unashamedly aimed at the totalitarian control of every aspect of our lives without having any positive effect on weather, climate, the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide, or life expectancy”.
In response to a consultation by the West Midlands Combined Authority, the ABDsaidthere is “nothing wrong with Britain’s air quality” and claims “outdoor air quality is better than what is found inside people’s homes”. It says the “so called science used to justify these zones is not proper science, but statistical manipulation performed by the tame academics of those lobbying against the car”.
In 2019, itlaunchedan “Against Birmingham’s Clean Air Zone” campaign.
Bristol: the ABDcriticiseda proposed ban on diesel cars in the city centre, citing tests carried out by the German automobile association ADAC that found “some diesel cars tested were cleaner than the equivalent petrol models”. It also claimed CAZs “take at least an order of magnitude more in revenue out of local economies than even the claimed value of benefits” and dismissed research on the health impacts of air pollution.
A representative of the ABD reportedly attended an “action day” against a proposed workplace parking levy in the city in 2012, designed to reduce car use. The event wasorganisedby the free-marketTaxPayers’ Allianceand attended by representatives from the Federation of Small Businesses and the Freedom Association.
Kent: Terry Hudson, one of the group’s directors,calledplans for a “car-free day” in Canterbury “gesture politics at its worst”, describing organisers as “Luddites”.
London: the ABD’s Brian Macdowall wasquotedin the Daily Express claiming the city’s Ultra Low Emission Zone would see a “big cost to drivers”, hitting the lowest earners hardest and calling the scheme “unnecessary”. He said disabled drivers, who will beexemptfrom the charge until 2025, the elderly and the “white van man” would be most affected by it.
The group has alsoclaimedthe ULEZ is a “giant con to raise more taxes to fix the Mayor’s budget problems” andurgedits supporters to respond to the public consultation.
The ABD’s London branch runs a number of campaigns against measures to reduce car traffic and speeds, includingLewisham’s “Healthy Neighbourhoods” initiative andCroydon’s plans to introduce 20mph speed limits across much of the borough.
The branch has alsoclaimedthat “diesel and petrol cars contribute only 12% and 6% respectively of all emissions in London” and that there are “many other sources” such as cooking and wood burning stoves.
The London branch of the ABDpostedon its blog in February 2021 about why low traffic neighbourhoods are “failing” and “deserve to do so”, arguing that LTNs have had “unintended consequences” and disadvantage the elderly and disabled in particular. The post also argues that “producing vehicles that produce less pollution”, reducing London’s population, and expanding and improving the existing road network are more “realistic ideas” for reducing traffic and air pollution in London. The blog, formerly called ABDLondon, has since rebranded as a blog for the Freedom for Drivers Foundation, whichstatesthat its website “previously promoted the Alliance of British Drivers (ABD)” but is “no longer associated with that organisation”.
Throughout March and April 2021, the Greater London branch of the ABDretweetedcontent from anti-LTN campaigners and groups including One groups and anti-LTN candidates for the 2021 London Mayoral race, including Reclaim candidate Laurence Fox and independent candidate Farah London.
Sussex:the Sussex branch of the ABD has been vocal on Twitter opposing LTNs, providing its own commentary as well as retweeting other anti-LTN groups and campaigners. On January 18, 2021, the branchtweeted: “Definition of hypocrite:  Sombody [sic] who votes for an LTN outside their house but continues to drive past other people’s houses.” On March 9 2021, the branchtweeted: “Some ask why we tweet about LTNs in London.  A. Many Sussex residents have to drive in London.  B. Don’t ever think this nonsense won’t spread to other cities and towns.” The branch also frequently retweets content from the UK’s premier climate denial group, theGlobal Warming Policy Foundation(GWPF).",,"The group’s patrons previouslyincludedDUP MPSammy Wilson, former UKIP MEPs Godfrey Bloom and Jill Seymour, and Conservative MPs Karl McCartney and David Morris.
An ABD spokesperson told DeSmog that despite Bloom not being “a member or a patron”, he continued to claim to represent the ABD in radio interviews.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Alliance of British Drivers (ABD) is a voluntary motoring pressure group “owned and controlled by its members”, who itdescribesas “representative of the mass of road users in the UK”.
The ABD has frequently cast doubt on the health impacts of air pollution and rejected the scientific consensus on climate change. It opposes emissions charging zones, designed to improve air quality, and has called for the removal of government support for electric vehicles.
The ABD has also been a vocal opponent of low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and other traffic reduction and active travel measures introduced by the government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to itswebsite, the group aims to “counter the misinformation spread by many people on the use of private vehicles” and “promote freedom of choice about how you travel”.
The group’s patrons previouslyincludedDUP MPSammy Wilson, former UKIP MEPs Godfrey Bloom and Jill Seymour, and Conservative MPs Karl McCartney and David Morris.
The ABD has been a vocal opponent of road pricing and congestion charges. Itarguesthat the “consent of the British people has never been sought for these schemes” and that they are “justified on erroneous environmental grounds”.
It believes that policies at national and local levels have “discriminated against drivers by means of misleading information, obstruction, restriction, delay and taxation”.
It also opposes many road safety measures, such as speed cameras, claiming that there is “no hard scientific evidence for any benefit”. It belongs to the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety.
The ABD says that private cars and motorcycles are the “most flexible” and “most cost effective” mode of transport and has alleged that those who “wish to stop you using them often have vested interests in public transport or otherwise wish to curtail your freedom”.
The ABD was formed in 1992 under the name Association of British Drivers, before merging with the Drivers Alliance, according to itswebsite.
A 2004 Guardian investigationfoundthat the group misleadingly claimed it had as many as 9,000 members. It also reported that one of its affiliated organisations wrongly claimed that “seatbelts kill more motorists than they save by trapping them in cars when they plunge into lakes and rivers”.
The groupcausedcontroversy in 2019 when its official Twitter account claimed that people were safer driving at high speeds because they were more alert, in an “expletive-laden response” to a pro-cycling advocate.
The group’s Twitter account again drew criticism in May 2020 for echoing far-right conspiracy theories when itsaidthat the UN, World Health Organisation and World Bank had been “captured by One World Global Marxist sympathisers” aiming to “gradually pauperise and depopulate the West”. The tweet was quickly deleted.",,,,,"The group strongly opposes emissions charging zones, with its Air Quality Campaign Manager Paul Hemingwayclaimingthat limits on diesel cars introduced by some German cities were done “for no good reason”. A former director of the group, Hemingway hasworkedas a manager at car companies throughout his career.
In anarticlefor the TransportXtra website, Paul Biggs, one of the group’s directors, wrote that the problem of air pollution was being exaggerated and “used to justify more taxes on some drivers in the guise of clean air zones (CAZ)”. He previouslycalleda King’s College London (KCL) study on the issue “junk statistics derived from junk epidemiology” and claimed the link between air pollution and increased risk of heart attacks had been “debunked”.
Speaking to DeSmog, Biggs accused KCL of being “linked with campaign groups” and “therefore heavily involved with advocacy”.
The ABD hasstatedthat plans to introduce Clean Air Zones in cities such as Birmingham are based on the “same flawed arguments” as in Germany and said emissions charging schemes “simply aren’t cost effective” at reducing air pollution.
Elsewhere, it says motorists should be able to “use the roads in a safe and responsible manner without being subject to unreasonable charges, restrictions or penalties”.
Instead, itargueswood burning stoves should be targeted, claiming that “one log-burning stove in a smokeless zone can produce more PM2.5 than 1000 petrol cars”.
The ABD’s Paul Biggs told DeSmog he was “one of the first, if not the first, in the UK to point out the folly of wood burning stoves being exempted” from clean air legislation in 2012.
He argued that “indoor air can be many times worse than outdoor air” and said there was a “biased focus on vehicle emissions, which are already well regulated via emission standards and engine technology”.",,,,,,,,"The ABD strongly criticised the government’s plans for a 2035 ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars, which it called an “over-reaction to the views of the extreme end of the environmental movement”.
It said the move would “threaten the very existence of the motor manufacturing industry” and argued that hybrids, which have been criticised by environmental campaigners as unnecessary, were a “good compromise solution”.
It also claimed there was “no certainty” that electric vehicles would be able to provide sufficient mileage range by this time, as well as arguing that the expansion of charging points and the electricity grid in general would “impose enormous costs on drivers and the economy”.
Despite saying it had “no gripe about encouraging the use of electric cars”, in 2017 it asked the Chancellor to cut the subsidy for new electric cars and said EV drivers should pay vehicle excise duty, though at a lower rate than for petrol and diesel cars.",,,,,,,,,"Registered under the company name “Pro-Motor”, the ABD had net assets of £19,000 as of March 2019, according to itsannual report.
Speaking to DeSmog, an ABD spokesperson said it did not receive funding from “any outside bodies, unlike our opponents”.",,,,"July 2021
In response to atweetfromNigel Farageasking “Why not just plant lots of trees?” instead of implementing “green taxes”, the ABDtweeted:
“Because planting trees & letting Nature do its stuff doesn’t allow eco-totalitarians free rein to push us all around, Nige. They prattle on, even though water vapour is far & away the most abundant & potent global warming gas & there’s NO “climate crisis””.
The ABD then linked to ablog postbyWilliam Happer, a US physicist and member of the academic advisory board of theGlobal Warming Policy Foundation, claiming that “there is no climate crisis” and that “climate frenzy is really heating up”.
December 2020
In a press release responding to a historic legal ruling by the inner South London coroner that illegal levels of air pollutioncontributedto the premature death of nine-year-old Ella Kissi-Debra, the ABDsaid:
“The verdict should not be used to curtail vehicle use via punitive taxation, road space reallocation or road blocks known as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs), which increase congestion and therefore vehicle emissions. Ella’s mother Ms Rosamund Kissi-Debrah has described the Lee Green LTN in Lewisham as ‘insane’. We promote the use of engine technology to further reduce vehicle emissions, including fuel additives, which the government is ignoring”.
November 2020
The ABD, alongside the APPG for Fair Fuel for UK Motorists and Hauliers, theRHA, andFair Fuel UK,wrotea letter to Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps calling for him to halt the roll-out of low traffic measures designed to promote active travel during the COVID-19 pandemic and the planned expansion of London’s Congestion Charge Zone to the North and South Circulars.
September 2019
The ABD published a revised version of areportentitled “Air Quality and Vehicles – The Truth”, in which it claims that “there is no public health crisis” as a result of air pollution.
July 27, 2017
Brian Macdowall, a director of the ABD, wrote anarticlefor the ConservativeHome website in which he criticised proposals to improve air quality in London by Mayor Sadiq Khan as “repressive”. He said the move was “sheer hypocrisy when you realise that he lays on large firework displays such as for New Year (repeatedly!) and promotes them at the Thames Festival”.",,,,,,,,"The ABD has been a vocal opponent of low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and other traffic reduction measures.
In a February 2021 appearance on talkRADIO, ABD spokesperson Paul Biggsspokewith host Mike Graham about a range of topics including government road spending, climate change, and LTNs. Regarding LTNs, Biggs said: “The environmentalists haven’t worried about local traffic – low traffic neighbourhoods, where they’ve actually increased congestion and therefore increased pollution. It took the taxi drivers to take the government to court, to take London to court over that”.
Referring to the roll-out of LTNs and the government’s decision in June 2019 to implement a legally-binding net-zero emissions target, Biggs said: “The big problem here is that everything bypasses democracy, there’s no proper democratic process to any of this”, adding that there had been “no proper debate” and “no proper costing” in either case.
After the schemes were initially encouraged during the pandemic, the ABD published a number of posts about LTNs on its website. In an article titled “Are there any benefits from Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs)?” the ABDclaimedthat “there is no evidence that Low Traffic Neighbourhoods produce any significant benefits while there is clear evidence that they delay emergency service vehicles”.
In another blog post, the ABDcommentedon articles fromThe Telegraphdetailing opposition to LTNs. The ABD claimed that “air pollution increased on main roads where traffic congestion increased, often grinding to a halt during rush hours” and that “there were also problems with access by emergency services to the LTNs”.
Regarding aclaimbyNigel Faragethat the Reform Party (formerly theBrexit Party) would “stand candidates against any and every local councillor who backs these new cycle lanes and road closures in next year’s local elections”, the ABDsaidthe party could gain supporters in “Labour controlled London boroughs” where LTNs were “deeply unpopular”. The ABD also said that similar boroughs were previously “good targets for the Brexit Party” because “the concerns of many working-class voters have been ignored by the new socialist elite”.
In the same blog post, the ABD reiterated the claim that LTNs and other road closure measures delay emergency vehicles.
In a December 2020 press release responding to a legal ruling by the assistant coroner for Inner South London that illegal levels of air pollutioncontributedto the premature death of nine-year-old Ella Kissi-Debra, the ABDsaidthat “the verdict should not be used to curtail vehicle use via punitive taxation, road space reallocation or road blocks known as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs), which increase congestion and therefore vehicle emissions”.
According to the local news blogInside Croydon, in November 2020ABD campaign manager Roger Lawson made a £200donationto help fund a legal challenge to an LTN in Croydon. That month, Open Our RoadsfiledHigh Court legal papers for a judicial review of the LTN against Croydon council.
Lawson’s donation was later removed from the page, and when asked byInside Croydonwhy the donation was removed, Eliska Finlay, founder of the Open Our Roads campaign, refused to comment.
In November 2020, the ABD andFair Fuel UK, theRoad Haulage Association(RHA), and the APPG for Fair Fuel for UK Motorists and Haulierswrotea letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps calling on him to halt and roll back green transport measures – including LTNs – that had been introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The letter, also co-signed by twelve Conservative MPs unconnected to the APPG, said: “UK’s 37m drivers, the millions of constituents across the country are feeling victimised by draconian charges and road restrictions initiated by local authorities and funded it seems, by the Department of Transport. The anger out there is palpable”.

It states that its members can “play a massive role in improving air quality” and that Clean Air Zones can be a “catalyst for behaviour change if supported with a targeted scrappage scheme”.
On awebpagededicated to the government’s air quality plans, theBVRLAstates that it has been “actively involved from the start to ensure the voice of the rental and leasing industry is heard by decision makers at a national and local level”.
It says it has had “regular contact with policy makers in the cities currently consideringCAZs, as well as at a national level with the Joint Air Quality Unit (JAQU)”, run by both the Environment and Transport Departments.
It also “meets with seniorMPs, Peers and other engaged stakeholders frequently to discuss air quality measures and plans, including with relevant select committee members and chairs” and has held “roundtable” events in various cities.
In itssubmissionto the March 2020 Budget, the organisation stated that the “transition to decarbonised road transport will be lost or won” in the coming decade and said it was looking to the Budget to “drive the transition to zero emission road transport”. It also called for continued support for “Future Mobility Zones” and “mobility credits”, designed to increase the use of low-carbon transport, reduce congestion and improve air quality.
In its2019 annual review, theBVRLAstates that its members have the “cleanest vehicle fleet on the road”, with “100% of members’ rental cars and 96% of lease cars” being “Clean Air Zone compliant”. The same year itsigneda joint declaration calling for the government to adopt World Health Organisation air quality standards and a national vehicle scrappage scheme to help drivers switch to electric vehicles or public transport. It has alsocelebratedthe London Ultra Low Emission Zone for successfully reducing the number of more polluting, non-compliant vehicles driving in the zone.
In a 2017videoon emissions regulations, the organisation’sCEOGerry Keaney said theBVRLAwere “great supporters” of low emission schemes in London and said it could “position its members as part of the solution” in other cities considering similar measures.
However, in its2018 annual reviewit describesCAZs as both a “threat” and an “opportunity” forBVRLAmembers and their customers. Elsewhere itarguesthat Clean Air Zones should “only be used where absolutely necessary” and should be “as small as possible to minimise disruption”.
TheBVRLAalso calls for exemptions from the charge forHGVs in “certain essential locations within Clean Air Zones” such as vehicle dealerships. It argues older Euro V lorries should be subject to a lower charge”, which it claims would preserve their second-hand value and enable operators of even older lorries to transition to cleaner vehicles faster.
It recommends allowing lorries to make deliveries at night and to use bus lanes outside of commuting hours to avoid congestion and pollution. It argues these measures could “reduce emissions and minimise the need to charge any road users, includingHGVs”.

Fair Fuel claims that UK drivers are the “highest taxed motorists in the world” and has commissioned reports from the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) into the impacts of fuel duty on the economy. A 2016 reportclaimedthat a 3p cut in fuel duty would lead to a £1 billion boost to the economy and the creation of 8,000 jobs.

In response to a consultation about the extension of the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) scheme in London, almost 5,000 responses were thrown out after it was discovered they were “so-called ‘copy and paste’ email responses opposed to the ULEZ extension – organised by the pro-motorist Fair Fuel campaign group”.

After the closure of a public consultation on London’s new Ultra Low Emissions Zone (ULEZ), Lewisham East MP Janet DabyaccusedFair Fuel UK of attempting to “undermine the integrity of this consultation and consign more Londoners to a lifetime of health issues”.
Fair Fuel UK said that more than 5,000 people responded to the public consultation with a template the organisation had pre-filled, asking London Mayor Sadiq Khan to cancel the ULEZ expansion.
In response to Daby’s comments, Fair Fuel UK founder Howard Coxsaid:

Fair Fuelproducedand paid for a report published by the APPG for Fair Fuel for UK Motorists and Hauliers which opposed the UK government’s ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. The reportattackedcost of the ban, questioned the science behind it, and warned of public unrest if it the ban were to go ahead.
The report featured an article and quotes from Fair Fuel UK founderHoward Cox, the APPG’s public enquiry point, and quotedSteve Baker MPand APPG vice-chairGraham Stringer MP, both trustees of the climate science-denyingGlobal Warming Policy Foundation(GWPF), andLord Peter Lilley, a former GWPF trustee.

Fair Fuel, alongside the APPG for Fair Fuel for UK Motorists and Hauliers, theRHA, and theABD,wrotea letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps calling for him to halt the roll-out of low traffic measures designed to promote active travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. The letter also called on Shapps to reverse the planned expansion of London’s Congestion Charge Zone to the North and South Circular roads.

Fair Fuel released a poll,coveredby The Sun, showing that nearly half of drivers who voted Conservative at the 2019 general election would abandon the party at the next election if fuel duty was increased at the upcoming Budget.
June 28, 2017
Fair Fuel’s Quentin Willsonwrotean article for London’s Evening Standard arguing that car drivers were being targeted despite only being a “relatively narrow band of polluters at 11% of NOx”. He also called for an “Air Quality Working Party, free from vested interests, to scientifically determine where the greatest levels of particulate and nitrogen dioxide pollutants really come from and how to reduce them in the short to medium term”.",,,,,,,,"Fair Fuel UK and its founder Howard Cox have made a number of statements opposing the roll-out of low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), many of which were implemented by local authorities after the governmentintroducedan Emergency Active Travel Fund during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
In March 2021, Coxtweetedin support of Consevative councillors in Greenwichcallingfor a halt to the roll-out of additional LTNs and other traffic measures across the borough, adding that “it seems there is no national LTN consistent policy”.
In January 2021, Craig MacKinlay MP, Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Fair Fuel for UK Motorists and Hauliers,toldBBC Radio 4 that low traffic schemes had been implemented in “ridiculous places” and that he was “not convinced” that the £250 million allocated to the schemes was “money well spent”. MacKinlay also commented on a judge’s ruling against Transport for London’s (TfL) Streetspace scheme, whichintroducedLTNs among other measures designed to promote active travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying: “I think the judgement in London has highlighted very well some of the things that are going wrong”.
In December 2020, Fair Fuel UK wasaccusedby campaign group Cycling UK of including leading questions about cycling and low traffic neighbourhoods in its “Annual Road User Opinion Survey”. Cycling UK said the Fair Fuel UK survey was designed around a number of “leading questions” about the introduction of cycle lanes during the pandemic and whether respondents approved of low traffic neighbourhoods.
In November 2020,Fair Fuel UK, along with theAlliance of British Drivers, theRoad Haulage Association, and the APPG for Fair Fuel for UK Motorists and Hauliers,wroteto Transport Secretary Grant Shapps calling on him to halt and roll back active transport measures – including LTNs – that had been introduced in response to the pandemic.
The letter, which was co-signed by APPG Chair Craig Mackinlay, Vice Chair Robert Halfon, and twelve other Conservative MPs including Sir David Amess, Steve Baker, and Andrew Bridgen,  said: “UK’s 37m drivers, the millions of constituents across the country are feeling victimised by draconian charges and road restrictions initiated by local authorities and funded it seems, by the Department of Transport. The anger out there is palpable”.
Fair Fuel UK and Cox have appeared a number of times in the UK media criticising low traffic neighbourhoods.
In November 2020, CoxtoldGloucestershire Livethat the government was implementing “anti-driver” policies. He said that while drivers support cycling, they do not support “virtue signalling road blocks or new cycle lanes eating into existing roads”, arguing that such measures increase congestion, emissions and “economic damage to white vans and hauliers in particular”. That same month, in an interview with The Daily Express, Coxsaidthat LTNs and businesses “cannot work alongside each other”.
Also in November 2020, Coxtweetedregarding the May 2021 London Mayoral race that Conservative candidate Shaun Bailey “must be elected to stop the [sic] @SadiqKhan’s insanity”. In the same tweet, Cox said that Transport Secretary Grant Shapps was going to announce “yet more millions for more UK LTN/Cycle lanes” and that the Conservatives were “promoting more congestion/emissions & economic ruin”.
In a September 2020 Daily Mail article about cycle lanes introduced in London as part of the government’s Emergency Active Travel Fund, Coxsaidthat most transport political advisers are “young, fit, well-off, urban-based Lycra-wearing cyclists” and that ”no pro-motoring groups are included in any discussions”. He added: “Every single driver wants to breathe clean air too, but there is no need to hit them in the pocket, ban them or block their freedom to drive by narrowing the roads for the benefit of a minority of road users who do not pay any [vehicle] tax”.
Cox alsosignedandshareda petition against the Arlington Road LTN,introducedin September 2020 in the London borough of Camden, and has actively opposed LTNs on social media.
In July 2020, Cox wasquotedin The Daily Express saying:  “This Government’s ignorance will decimate businesses and the economies of our major towns and cities and is a naive knee jerk response to those emotive driven, well financed, so called environmental groups based in the London bubble”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.desmog.com/fair-fuel-uk/,,,https://www.desmog.com/air-pollution-lobbying-database/

It explained it therefore needed to find a middle ground on issues rather than oppose measures outright.
It also said it wasn’t “sustainable” for people to keep doing whatever they liked regardless of environmental impacts and that “most governments are trying to move public attitudes towards reducing blatant consumerism”.
However, theFBHVChas made strong calls for historic vehicles to be exempt from emissions charging schemes.
In a 2019issueof its in-house magazine, theFBHVCsaid it had been making efforts to secure a “general exemption for Historic Vehicles into the primary legislation” for Clean Air Zones (CAZ) but that this had not been successful.
In the previousissue, theFBHVCsaid it could no longer rely on the public being generally supportive of the “historic vehicle movement” as a result of growing concern about climate change and air pollution.
The group said it needed to “recognise this change, respect the reasons for it” and “justify our activities with politeness and care”.
It noted it had responded to consultations on a number of proposedCAZs, including in Leeds and Birmingham, and Low Emission Zones (LEZ), such as in Edinburgh, where theFBHVChas been calling for exemptions for historic vehicles, particularly buses.
In a 2018issue, theFBHVCsaid it was emphasising the “insignificant actual effect on the environment of historic vehicles” in responses to proposed clean air schemes.

Bradford: in response to a consultation on the city’s proposedCAZ, theFBHVCsaidit was “not opposed” but argued that exemptions for historic buses should be considered because they are only used rarely and “do not contribute significantly to pollution levels”.
Edinburgh: in response to a consultation on the city’s proposedLEZ, itsaidit did not question the “need and the justification for aLEZ” but that its impact on owners of, and businesses involved in, historic vehicles could be “significant”. It called for exemptions for vehicles over 30 years old and said “heritage” buses used for cultural purposes less than 30 years old should also be offered exemptions of some kind.
Glasgow: in response to a consultation on the city’s proposedLEZ, the organisationsaidit was “not opposed” but wanted to see exemptions for vehicles over 30 years old, citing data from a survey it conducted in 2016 suggesting historic vehicles only cover an estimated 0.21 percent of total vehicle mileage.

Oxford: In a 2019issueof its in-house magazine, theFBHVCsaid it had recommended permits for historic vehicles for cultural events in its response to a consultation on the city’s proposed Zero Emission Zone (ZEZ).
Sheffield: in a 2019issueof its in-house magazine, theFBHVCsaid it had called for the same approach to exemptions as Leeds in its consultation response to the city’s proposedCAZ. In its response, itarguedthe exemption of historic vehicles should “in principle” be encouraged because there was “no public interest in encouraging the scrapping of cultural artefacts” and their contribution to pollution was small.
Scotland: responding to a consultation on the country’sLEZproposals in April 2020, theFBHVCcalledfor vehicles over 30 years old, including buses, to be exempted from the schemes “on a time-limited basis”.

Federation of Small BusinessesUnited Kingdom,,,,"In a foreword to its 2018-19 annual report, its National Chairman Mike Cherrywrotethat sustainability was “fast becoming not just a priority for small businesses, but in some cases absolutely core to their business model”.
Responding to a Welsh government consultation on its Clean Air Framework in 2018, theFSBsaidthat there was “no doubt that poor air quality is harmful to our health” and improving it in many urban areas would “lead to better living standards”.
It also said that Clean Air Zones (CAZ) would “provide a means of addressing air quality challenges in Wales”.
In a 2017 report on air quality entitledClearing the air, theFSBsaid it recognised the “damaging contribution made by diesel engines and the growing calls for the more damaging vehicles to be removed fromUKroads”. It also stated that diesel vehicles were “responsible for the vast majority (92%)” ofNO2concentrations around local roads.
TheFSBhas also previouslypartneredwith other business groups and environmental organisations, including Greenpeace, to call on the government to introduce a national diesel scrappage scheme. Itwelcomedthe announcement of a scheme to help small businesses replace old diesel vans in London by the city’s mayor Sadiq Khan.
However, the organisation told DeSmog that scrappage schemes introduced so far would be sufficient to “satisfy the Government’s timescales for the reduction of emissions”. It said theFSBwanted “as a starting point” to see a diesel scrappage scheme for small businesses based in, “or frequently operating within”, plannedCAZs.
TheFSBtold DeSmog it is committed to finding cost-effective solutions to reducing air pollution but said any clean air schemes must be “affordable, achievable and fair”.
In response to a Welsh government consultation on its Clean Air Framework in 2018, theFSBsaidbusinesses that have invested in diesel vehicles “should not be punished for following the advice of the government”. It argued the council should therefore only phase in the proposed Clean Air Zone over time.
In the 2018 document, it said the council should conduct an economic impact assessment for theCAZand make “short-term hardship exemptions” for firms that can prove the cost of upgrading vehicles would be prohibitive or lead to the business closing.
It also stated that it would not support a “blanket direction” to local authorities in Wales to introduce aCAZand argued local authorities should “move cautiously” with regard to tightening emissions standards over time because many businesses are locked into leasing cycles.
In a submission of evidence to a 2018parliamentary inquiryinto clean air policy, theFSBwarned that emissions charging zones could discourage smaller businesses from entering city centres, giving them a disadvantage compared to larger companies that could more easily afford the costs.
In response to a 2017 consultation on proposals to strengthen emissions standards for heavy vehicles in the existing London-wide Low Emission Zone (LEZ) and to expand theULEZto the North and South Circular roads, theFSBsaid it opposed the policies. According to asummary of responses, it argued the proposals would “affect very many small and micro businesses” and did not allow enough time for businesses to upgrade vehicles.
In its 2017 reportClearing the air, theFSBsaid the introduction ofCAZs could “hit up to 1.5 million small businesses and self-employed” who will have more difficulty transitioning to cleaner vehicles than larger companies and advocated for a “proportionate” approach to the clean air schemes.
It claimed only 10 local authorities in theUKwould be in breach of air quality limits by 2022, suggesting that those forecast to meet these limits by this time “may question the cost/benefit of aCAZ”.
It also argued the cost of upgrading light goods vehicles (LGVs) remained “prohibitively high”.
Speaking to Air Quality News about the report, theFSB’s National Chairmansaid: “Firms are already struggling with the soaring costs of running a business today, and it is simply not fair to them, or to the benefit of the wider economy, to suddenly burden them with substantial additional costs associated with improving air quality.”
The same statement wasrepeatedin response to a survey that found three-quarters of small and medium-sized business owners were in favour ofCAZs.
According to asummary of responsesto a 2016 consultation on the introduction of London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone, theFSBsaid that current charges on vehicles were doing “more harm than good to London’s competitiveness” and said “action should be taken before small businesses are priced out of London”. It argued clean air policies should not come “at a disproportionately high cost to business, damaging jobs, business viability and the economy as a whole”.
Itopposedbringing forward the introduction of the scheme to 2019, arguing that this did not allow for businesses to upgrade vehicles “without significant cost hardship”.

Cardiff: in response to a green paper on transport and clean air policy drawn up by Cardiff Council, theFSBsaidthe proposedCAZshould only be phased in over time and that “short-term” exemptions should be made for firms that would struggle to comply.
However, it also said it supported the “ambition to deliver increased electric vehicle usage and the installation of a comprehensive network of charging points”.

He also called for more electric vehicle infrastructure, saying there were currently “nowhere near enough” charging points even for private cars.
TheFSBhas also spoken in support of Heathrow expansion anddescribedthe ruling against the project in February 2020 as a “blow to small firms who need greater regional and global connectivity”.

In asubmissionto the London Assembly Transport Committee, it noted research that found “motorised road traffic contributes 60% of particulate matter (PM10), 47% of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 17% of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in London”. Its General Secretary Steve McNamara has alsowrittenabout “tackling the climate emergency”.
When contacted by DeSmog, the LTDA said it was “fully committed to addressing air pollution in the capital” and said its drivers “understand only too well the need for action to address London’s toxic air, which they breathe every day”.
The LTDA hasarguedthat London’s “already-poor air pollution problem” is being exacerbated by a “spiralling number of private hire vehicles (PHVs), decreasing road supply and an increase in the number of light goods vehicles”. It hasclaimedUber drivers cause unnecessary pollution by “cruising” while looking for work.
In 2016, the LTDAcalledon the government to allow Transport for London to cap the number of private hire vehicles, arguing the growth in PHVs “simply leads to roads being clogged and further polluting London’s air”.
It has alsoparticipatedin initiatives to raise awareness about the pollution caused by “engine idling” andurgedthe government to introduce a national diesel scrappage scheme.
However, its General Secretary has alsoclaimedthat the “cab trade’s contribution to the problem [of air pollution] is debatable”.
The group successfullyopposedlicensed taxis being included in the London ULEZ, arguing that they provide accessibility for wheelchair users. It told DeSmog licensed taxis “play a vital role in London, as the only form of 100% accessible transport and our world-renowned, knowledgeable drivers help keep the capital moving as efficiently as possible”.
The LTDA has also stronglycriticisedthe lowering of the age limit on older taxis from 15 to 12 years, designed to speed up the adoption of cleaner vehicles. Transport for London adopted an LTDA proposal to exempt Euro V taxis converted to Euro VI from this change.
A Transport for London spokesperson clarified that the age limit on taxis would be phased in one year at a time.
Elsewhere, the group hascriticisedthe retrofitting of taxis to run on liquified petroleum gas (LPG) as a “halfway house” and a “short term measure”. Responding to a select committee inquiry, it argued that “historically conversions of taxis to run on liquid petroleum gas have been unreliable” and that they would “not provide the same improvements to air quality” as “zero emission capable” taxis.
The LTDA has also resisted a number of local air quality schemes,encouragingits members to reply to consultations. For instance, the LTDAopposedplans to ban taxis, as well as lorries and cars, from Tottenham Court Road during the day, with the group’s General Secretary calling the scheme a “throwback to some 1960s pedestrian utopia”. He also said it would “cause pollution and chaos everywhere”. It has also opposed “Streetspace” schemes to boost walking and cycling, bringing legal challenges to the Mayor of London and Transport for London,accordingtoTaxiPointmagazine.

The group has stronglycriticisedthe company Uber, calling it “unscrupulous” and saying it displays “disgraceful conduct”. ItsupportedMayor of London Sadiq Khan’s decision to revoke Uber’s licence in the city in November 2019 and has blamed the company for a rise in congestion and air pollution.
The LTDA has organised a number of protests over the years,includingoutside the offices of the Evening Standard newspaper when former Chancellor George Osborne took over as editor.
The LTDA jointlyfundsthe All Party Parliamentary Group on Taxis, along with the London Electric Vehicle Company and the taxi app Free Now. The APPG, whose secretariat the LTDA helps pay for, hasheldevents on how to improve rapid charging infrastructure and increase the use of electric taxis but alsoworksto “ensure that calls on the trade to modernise are balanced against its ability to survive”. It is chaired by Labour MP Wes Streeting and composed of both Labour and Conservative MPs.",,,,"Although the LTDA has said it supports more segregated cycling infrastructure, it has alsoopposedsome schemes, such as the Victoria Embankment “cycle superhighway”, arguing that they were “rushed through” and have a “massive detrimental effect on traffic movements and air quality”.
Itcelebratedthe cancellation of a section of the “cycle superhighway” through West London, welcoming the decision of Kensington and Chelsea Council. The LTDA argued the scheme “would have had a serious impact on the ability of taxi drivers to do their jobs in that part of town” and said the move showed “what can be achieved by making your voices heard”.
It was also highly critical of cycling infrastructure plans while Boris Johnson was Mayor of London,callingthem “barmy Boris’s barking mad bike scheme”. The group’s General Secretary claimed the policy would cause more congestion and “further worsen the atrocious air quality in London”.",,,,,"The LTDA has beensupportiveof efforts to increase the use of electric and Zero Emission Capable (ZEC) taxis, calling on the government to invest in more fast-charging points and provide financial assistance to those switching to electric taxis. It haspartneredwith the company Ohme to reduce power charging costs for taxi drivers.
Elsewhere it hascriticisedLondon boroughs for not providing enough charging points and said taxi drivers should be given access to underused charging hubs in bus garages.
It has alsocalledon the government to exempt electric taxis from vehicle excise duty andarguedthe London ULEZ should apply the same standards on these vehicles for both licensed taxis and private hire vehicles.
In 2017, its General Secretarytoldthe Evening Standard that by 2023 diesel taxis would be “a thing of the past”.
The LTDA told DeSmog the taxi trade had “invested over £200 million in ZEC vehicles”, which all new taxis in London are now required to be, since 2018 and “prior to the COVID-19 crisis, was continuing to invest at the rate of nearly £3 million per week”.",,,,,,,,,,,"The LTDA had turnover of £2.2m from its 10,183 members in 2018, with assets of £3.4m, according to its annual report.",,,,,,,,,,,,"The LTDA has opposed low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), most notably through its legal action against London’s Streetscape scheme, which wasintroducedby Transport for London (TfL) and the Mayor of London to create more space for people to “safely walk, cycle, scoot or wheel” during the COVID-19 pandemic. The LTDA has also expressed concerns about the potential impact of LTNs on the taxi trade and its customers in its newsletter and in the media.
In January 2021, the High Court ruled against Transport for London (TfL)’s Streetspace scheme following a legal challenge from the LTDA and the United Trade Action Group (UTAG), a taxi group founded byUnited Cabbies GroupGeneral Secretary, Trevor Merralls. The scheme introduced LTNs, temporary cycle lanes, wider pavements, and School Streets among other measures designed to promote active travel.
The judgedeclaredthe Streetspace scheme as “unlawful”, saying: “It was possible to widen pavements to allow for social distancing and to allocate more road space to cater for an increase in the number of cyclists, without seeking to ‘transform’ parts of Central London into predominantly car-free zones”.
In response to the ruling, the LTDA’s General Secretary Steve McNamarasaid: “The taxi trade has been an integral part of London’s public transport network for centuries. With our growing fleet of zero emission capable vehicles, we now want [to] be part of its future and ensure London remains accessible and open to all”.
McNamara spoke with radio station LBC’s Nick Ferrari about the court’s decision, saying that the government “decided they were going to use this pandemic to push through their agendas of “’two wheels good, four wheels bad’”.
The following month, TfLannouncedthat they had applied for permission to appeal the judgment, arguing that the schemes were improving road safety and “enabling social distancing and much faster journeys on public transport, reducing the risk of infection”.
TfL and the Mayor of London weregrantedpermission to appeal the ruling in April, which the Court of Appealupheldin June, thus leaving the Streetspace schemes intact. The LTDA has said it was “extremely disappointed” with the outcome and is considering whether to bring the case to the Supreme Court.
In the 29 June 2021 edition of the LTDA’s newspaper, LTDA General Secretary Steve MacNamara commented on the Court of Appeal’s ruling,saying: “How the Mayor can claim such a mandate after a relatively poor showing in the recent [mayoral] election is beyond me. Let alone when, across London, campaigners including local residents and disabled people, continue to fight these schemes and a number of councils have recently scrapped LTNs or announced fundamental changes to how they operate in response to local opposition. The Mayor may see this as a win but as far as I am concerned this makes it one all and the matter is far from over.”
In the 1 June 2021 edition of the LTDA’s newspaper, LTDA Chairman Paul Brennan commented on Sadiq Khan’s remarks regarding the Streetspace Court of Appeals victory and his 2021 re-election as Mayor of London, saying theyrepresenta “double mandate” for continued investment in active travel schemes. Brennansaidthat existing schemes, including LTNs, have “near universally resulted in additional congestion”. Brennan also said that the schemes “rely on every day on London’s roads being a perfect day” and that LTNs and cycle lanes “cause havoc even on the very best of days”. Brennan also reiterated claims that LTNs negatively impact emergency service response times and that people “no longer feel safe walking in Low Traffic Neighbourhoods, especially in the evening”.
In February 2021, the LTDApointedto the initial Streetspace ruling in a letter to Camden Councilurgingit to reverse taxi restrictions on Tottenham Court Road and Charing Cross Road. The restrictions are part of Camden Council’s West End Project, a £35 million scheme begun in 2015 anddesignedto “provide safer, greener and more attractive streets for residents,” visitors, and businesses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.desmog.com/licensed-taxi-drivers-association/,,,https://www.desmog.com/air-pollution-lobbying-database/
Logistics UKUnited Kingdom,,,,"LogisticsUKsays on itswebsitethat it is “committed to helping members make their operations greener and more efficient” and that heavy goods vehicles are “vital to reducing emissions as they are the most energy and road space efficient way of moving freight on a per tonne basis”.
Elsewhere, it has said it “accepts that further public policy measures are required if theUKis to meet its legal obligations for nitrogen dioxide levels in the worst polluted spots around theUK”.
When contacted by DeSmog, LogisticsUKpointed to its participation in initiatives such as the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership and Logistics Emissions Reduction Scheme as a demonstration of its commitment to meeting “the need for new product developments in this area”.
However, the organisation has strongly criticised the introduction of chargingCAZs across theUKand told DeSmog its members believed they were “not the most effective method to implement change”.
LogisticsUKlistedone of its 2019 “policy achievements” as delaying the introduction of Clean Air Zones in sixUKcities, when it was known as the Freight Transport Association. “Due toFTAlobbying, six city Clean Air Zones (CAZs) or air quality schemes, including London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), have had their start dates delayed for as long as possible”, it said.
LogisticsUK‘s Head of Urban Policy Natalie Chapmanarguedin a 2019 article that there were “better ways of improving air quality” and that the latest EuroVIvehicles would be adopted anyway “as part of the natural fleet replacement cycle”. “All that aCAZorLEZ[Low Emission Zone] does is speed this up,” she wrote.
In abriefingfor local authorities, LogisticsUKclaims the benefits ofCAZs would be “short-lived” and that the schemes are “not cheap for local authorities to implement”. It argues that “the money could be better invested in measures that will enable those who can to make changes to their fleet or operations”, stating thatCAZs are “not necessary to deliver improved air quality”.
It also claims that the “pollution footprint of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) in cities is set to fall radically in the next few years without any further intervention”.
It arguesCAZs are “disruptive to local businesses” and have the “hardest impact on those with the least means to replace vehicles”. The resale value of older Euro 5 has “plummeted” as a result of clean air policies, it says.
Alternatives it proposes include incentivising the uptake of non-diesel and -petrol vehicles, better traffic congestion management and switching freight delivery out of peak times.
ForCAZs that it deems unavoidable due toEUtargets, it makes a number of recommendations, including that they should be “as small as possible”, thatHGVcharges should be £50, half the £100 limit, that grants should be offered by central government, and that vans should be excluded because the Euro 6 standard for vans was introduced later than for other vehicle types.
It also says on itswebsitethat efforts to improve air quality are “resulting in a patchwork of regulation which is difficult for businesses operating in multiple areas of the country to comply with” and that there is a need for “cohesive policies”.",,,,,"LogisticsUKhas objected to plans for Clean Air Zones in numerous cities and asked for delays in most cases. It has also encouraged its members to respond to public consultations on the schemes.

However, it said the plans were “unfair, unreasonable, disproportionate and certainly unaffordable” in their present form.
It argued that a proposal to reduce the 15-year age limit on London taxis to 10, designed to speed up the adoption of cleaner vehicles, would cost the trade £200m by damaging the resale value of second-hand taxis.

Green Badge taxis arelicensedto pick passengers up anywhere in London while drivers with a yellow badge specialise in local suburban areas.
In its consultationresponse, theLCDCalso objected to banning new Euro 6 diesel taxis, but not the equivalent for coaches, vans andHGVs, claiming they represented “a major shift down in terms ofNOx emissions, making diesel emissions equivalent to petrol engines”. It argued that Transport for London should “encourage sales of Euro 6 diesel engine taxis” as the “fastest, most practical way” to reduce bothNOx andCO2emissions.
It criticised the lack of available zero emissions capable (ZEC) taxis at the time, which it said put the taxi trade at “severe risk”. It recommended that the goal of 50g/km averageCO2emissions for new taxis should only be introduced once enough compliant vehicles were being manufactured.

However, it also said it did not believe Clean Air Zones were the “best way to tackle the issue” and said encouraging single-occupancy car drivers to use motorcycles would be a “significant solution to poor air quality and carbon emissions”.
The group has also lobbied strongly against motorcycles being subject to charges under London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), which itdescribedin 2019 as a “punitive toxic tax”. It claimed the £12.50 charge for non-compliant motorcycles would increase the cost of a daily commute “by over 1,000%”.
When contacted by DeSmog, MAG claimed that “73% of all pre-Euro 3 motorcycles individually tested in London emit less than the required limit”, arguing that these motorcyclists were being unfairly subject to charges and had no access to financial support if they needed to test their own vehicles.
In a recently-deletedposton its website, the group claimed there was “no evidential basis to justify the charge for motorcycles” under the ULEZ and that motorcyclists were being “victimised” by a “draconian policy”.
MAG produced avideoin 2018 criticising the ULEZ, introduced the following year. It argued that if motorcycles and scooters were “accepted as a legitimate transport mode” and a proportion of car drivers switched to using them, congestion would fall dramatically and there would be “no need” to impose emissions charges.
The groupmadethe same argument on Clean Air Day in June of the same year, when it called on “all those who own motorbikes or scooters to ride to work on two wheels to help reduce pollution”.Elsewhere, it has argued that the “environmental and congestion benefits of bikes” are “massive”.
MAG’s Director of Campaigns & Political Engagement Colin Brown hascalledthe inclusion of motorcycles in the ULEZ charging scheme a “tragic and embarrassing mistake which, unfortunately, seems to come simply from an inability to actually understand the evidence”. He has argued motorcycles reduce air pollution by “filtering past” traffic congestion and the reason they are not being promoted is “prejudice”.
A Transport for London spokesperson told DeSmog that while motorcycles produce a small amount of overall air pollution in the city because of how comparatively few motorcyclists there are, individual motorcycles can contribute significant amounts.
While the ULEZ was still in the planning stages in 2016, MAGsaidit had “raised major concerns about a ridiculous new ‘tax on biking’ in the county’s capital city”, claiming that it would be “counterproductive” because motorcycles produce less pollution than cars and no congestion.
MAG opposes the banning of new petrol-powered motorcycles, as the government plans to do for cars and vans. In a February 2020articleon its website, the group notes that its Director of Communications & Public Affairs Lembit Opik attended a talk by Professor Gautam Kalghatgi, an adviser to theGlobal Warming Policy Foundation, the UK’s principal climate science denial group.

Motorcycle Industry AssociationUnited Kingdom,,,,"TheMCIAstates on itswebsitethat “as technology moves away from the internal combustion engine, electrification and other powertrain technologies will see transport take on a new dimension”.
In a 2019 promotional video, theMCIAlisted“the need to reduce congestion” and “to improve air quality” among the changes “we must embrace in the next decade”. It argued a shift to Powered Light Vehicles, which include motorcycles and micro cars, would lead to emissions falling significantly.
Tweeting about the video, theMCIAsaidthere was an “alternative to single-occupancy cars and low-utilisation vans clogging city streets”.
Inresponseto the Draft New London Plan, outlining the Mayor’s development strategy for the city, theMCIAargued in 2018 that Powered Two-Wheelers (PTW) such as motorcycles and scooters should be “recognised along with walking, cycling and public transport as a low-pollution and congestion-busting alternative to car and van use”.
It said that because “motorcycles contribute extremely little to the amount of air pollution produced by transport”, any low emission zones that impose charges on older vehicles should offer incentives for people and businesses to upgrade to cleaner models, such as a diesel scrappage scheme.
TheMCIAhas alsocalledfor more government support for the sale of electric motorcycles.
While the organisation has said motorcycles should be subject to charging under London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), it argues this should be “proportional”.
TheMCIAtold DeSmog there were also many motorcycles liable for charges despite their emissions being below the minimum Euro 3 standard and that motorcyclists were having to prove this through expensive tests. It said it had offered to help Transport for London (TfL) “categorise the affectedPTWs by researching their stated emissions and requested a temporary suspension while this work was done” but this was not forthcoming.
It also said it was “especially unjust” that low-income motorcyclists, most likely to own a vehicle of this age, would have to pay the charge.
A TfL spokesperson said the issue of some owners needing to test their vehicles was common to all vehicle types and highlighted the Mayor of London’sscrappage schemeto help “low income and disabled Londoners” scrap their motorcycles for cleaner vehicles.
In 2019, theMCIA’sPRManagerwrotea column for The Telegraph arguing that Transport for London should have “shown a little more foresight with their charging structure” by distinguishing between motorcycles and other types of traffic.
The same year, itsaidit was “extremely disappointing” that motorcycles would be subject to the same charges as “single-occupancy 4x4s from the same era” and argued that motorcyclists were being “erroneously vilified”. It called for the charge to be suspended and said it was “quite incredible thatTFLand the Mayor continue to discriminate against the users of motorcycles and scooters and to ignore their benefits”.
When contacted by DeSmog, theMCIAsaid it was against the “disproportionate nature of the scheme, not the scheme itself”.
In a 2018 article, theMCIAwasquotedas saying that Transport for London was “waging a war on motorised transport” and failing to distinguish between motorcycles and other forms of traffic. ItsCEOclaimed that Mayor of London Sadiq Khan “clearly has his own agenda around motorcycles and scooters”.
It has alsoclaimedthe scheme is “operating in a legal grey area” because of confusion over the compliance of different types of vehicles.
Responding to a 2017-18 consultation on expanding theULEZ, theMCIAsaidthe proposals were not proportionate for motorcycles due to the small amount of emissions it says they produce, though when contacted by DeSmog, it said its opposition to the geographical expansion had been “erroneously reported”. According to a summary of responses to the consultation, it was “broadly supportive” of renewing the motorcycle fleet with less polluting vehicles and argued that any charges under the scheme should go towards a scrappage scheme.
A TfL spokesperson told DeSmog that while overall emissions from motorcycles were comparatively small, individual motorcycles can produce significant amounts of pollution.
In a 2016 article, anMCIArepresentativecriticisedthe LondonULEZclaiming that “motorcycles contribute to reducing the air pollution” and that the £12.50 per day charge for non-compliant motorcycles was “not a fair deal” because not everyone could afford to “run out and buy a new bike”.

In 2018, ithighlightedofficial figures showing a long-term decline in air pollutants, with its Director saying it was “positive to see that total emissions from motor vehicles declined by 12% from 2012 to 2016”. She said the data demonstrated that new cars “are contributing significantly to reducingNOx emission levels”. She called for “well-targeted measures” to be implemented to “ensure that motorists continue to replace their old cars with new, cleaner ones”.

Following the publication of the government’s air quality plan in 2017, theNFDAsaidit was “pleased to see that the Government is determined to be at the forefront of vehicle innovation by making motoring cleaner”.
However, theNFDAhas alsoarguedthat the “largest gains in air quality will come by encouraging the uptake of the latest low emission vehicles of all fuel types”, including petrol and diesel vehicles.
It said government policy should consider the “impact of all types of air pollution, expanding beyond private cars, motorcycles and vans” to include “other forms of transport, industry and buildings”.
TheNFDAhas also opposed rises in fuel duty andwelcomednews that it would be frozen for the tenth consecutive year following the 2020 Budget.
It told DeSmog it supported a “well-targeted, coordinated approach aimed at reducing emissions and promoting the uptake of low and zero emission vehicles” but that this should include the “latest generation internal combustion engine vehicles” where appropriate.
It also said it was working across the industry and with government to “encourage as many motorists as possible to switch to environmentally friendly cars”.",,,,,"Bristol: theNFDArespondedto the council’s plans to ban diesel cars from the city centre during the day by saying that it was “important to differentiate between old and new diesel”. It argued that the latest diesel models “represent the most efficient vehicles for many motorists and emit lessCO2than their petrol equivalents”.
It said diesel drivers should not be “penalised” after they had been encouraged to buy their cars by previous governments.
It called for a diesel scrappage scheme and noted the efforts retailers were making to encourage the uptake ofEVs.
London: theNFDAsaidit supported the creation of an Ultra Low Emission Zone but made a number of criticisms inresponseto a consultation on the scheme in 2015. TheNFDAand theBVRLAsupported postponing the introduction date forHGVs beyond 2020, arguing that cleaner technology for this vehicle type is at an earlier stage than for cars. The two organisations also backed a 12-month grace period where warning notices would be issued instead of charges.
TheNFDA, along with motorcycle groups and the Campaign for Better Transport, called for lower charges for motorcyclists as a result of shorter journey times. Transport for London rejected this recommendation, noting that faster journeys would not necessarily lead to lower emissions, as well as motorcyclists’ tendency to accelerate and decelerate regularly, increasing emissions.

It said it was positive that the government had stated that “‘cleaner diesel cars and vans can play an important part in reducingCO2emissions’ during the transition to zero emissions”. It said it supported reductions in air pollution from diesel vehicles but that it was “confident” the latest standards would help.
TheNFDA’s Director alsosaidshe was “confident that the new, stricter standards” on diesel vehicles would “prove crucial” in reducing emissions.
Researchon cars’ “real-world” emissions published by the International Council on Clean Transportation the same yearfoundthat even the latest Euro 6 diesel vehicles had significantly higherNOx emissions than petrol equivalents and exceeded emissions limits.
In 2017, theNFDAproduceda leaflet on diesel to help its members “educate the public”, arguing that consumers needed “accurate and honest information to select the car that best suits their needs”.
The leaflet highlighted improvements in diesel engines and said they accounted for “only 11% ofNOx emissions” in Greater London, claiming that cars were “not the biggest contributors to air pollution”.
It argued alternative measures should be implemented first before introducing Clean Air Zones and recommended urban drivers buy petrol vehicles and long-distance drivers buy diesel.
Official figuresshow diesel cars are the largest single contributor in London to roadsideNOx concentrations, where most people come into contact with poor air quality, along with buses.
In response to the government’s air quality plan in June 2017, theNFDA’s Director Sue Robinsoncalledon the government to adopt a “wider approach which does not focus solely on diesel to quickly and efficiently tackle air quality issues”. She said that the public needed to understand that the latest Euro 6 diesel vehicles are “cleaner and emit much lowerNOx emissions than older diesel models”.
TheNFDAhas alsoarguedthat the latest diesel-poweredHGVs have the “cleanest engines ever” and “vastly reduced real-worldNOx emissions”.
In response to a proposed ban on new diesel and petrol vehicles by 2040, announced in 2017, theNFDAsaidit was “concerned that the total focus may be heavily placed on the automotive industry” and argued that owners of the latest Euro 6 diesel models “should not be penalised”. It also described a proposed diesel scrappage scheme as an “expensive blunt instrument” that failed to target the oldest, most polluting vehicles, having previouslysaidthat a scrappage scheme “would be welcomed by theNFDAas it would benefit theUKeconomy, job market and consumers”.

RACUnited Kingdom,,,,"TheRACacknowledges the health impacts of vehicle emissions on itswebsite, noting the “range of health problems” to which they contribute, as well as the fact that “long-term repeated exposure to diesel exhaust fumes may also increase the risk of lung cancer”.
In itsresponseto the government’s Draft Clean Air Zone Framework in 2016, theRACsaid it supported the government’s then “long term aim for all new vehicles to be zero emission by 2040, and for all vehicles on the road to be zero emission by 2050”. The ban on new diesel and petrol cars may now bebrought forwardto 2035 or 2032.
However, theRACwelcomed the fact the proposals did not “target” private cars, claiming these “contribute a relatively small proportion of Nitrogen Dioxide Emissions” in most cities.
In 2019, theRACpublished anarticlecritical of councils with predominantly diesel vehicle fleets, asking its readers: “What do you think about theUK‘s clean air zones? Perhaps you own a diesel vehicle and feel like you’re being unfairly punished?”
Responding to air quality plans published by the government in 2017, theRACsaidit was “deeply worrying” that local authorities would “have an option of introducing chargeable Clean Air Zones which would affect owners of relatively new diesel and some petrol vehicles”.
It said “charges to owners of all but the newest diesel cars should be an absolute last resort”.
Similarly, it hasarguedthat where charging regimes are proposed “the Government must ensure that all other solutions for reducing emissions have been exhausted”.
Elsewhere it hascriticisedthe government’s devolution of air quality measures to local authorities, questioning “whether councils have the skills or resources to take on the task of objectively finding the best means of cutting air pollution”.
TheRAChas alsoexpressedconcerns about different clean air schemes being introduced across the country, saying that this could “lead to confusion for road users”.
It hasurgedthe government to “engage communities” on the issue of air pollution because “ultimately these communities will be affected by poor local air quality and any subsequent impacts of the charging zones”.
TheRAChas been a vocalsupporterof tackling “engine idling” as a way of improving air quality, arguing that if such measures can reduce emissions sufficiently, “there may be less of a temptation for local authorities to implement wider charging schemes for drivers”.
Previous research on the proportion of air pollution caused by idling has been inconclusive, although oneUSstudyfoundthat stopping the practice outside schools with lots of buses had significantly reduced emissions.
When contacted by DeSmog, a spokesperson for theRACsaid that it “fully appreciates the need for towns and cities to take steps to improve local air quality” but stressed that “these are complex, often nuanced issues”.
He said there were “cases where a chargingCAZis not required as other measures bring down emission levels without the need to introduce a class DCAZ”, which covers all vehicles.
“Our position on emissions has evolved over time as more evidence indicates the impact of vehicle emissions on health and climate. We believe that it is absolutely right that the motoring sector reduces its emissions footprint and will continue to welcome Government initiatives which encourage cleaner driving,” he said.",,,,,"Bristol: theRACcriticisedplans to ban diesel vehicles from the city centre, arguing that major routes would become out of bounds, pushing diesel vehicles onto other roads and potentially “causing congestion problems where they don’t exist at the moment”.
London: in 2018, theRACcriticisedthe planned expansion of the Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) into residential areas within the North and South Circular roads, saying residents and businesses had “just three years to become compliant”. It argued the time pressures and costs would be “keenest felt by those from low income backgrounds”.
The group said in a 2016consultation responsethat changes to Clean Air Zones should ideally be given a “lead time” of 3 years and a “minimum of 2 years”.
According to asummaryof consultation responses on theULEZ, theRACbelieved there wasn’t “adequate evidence to justify such an increase”, preferring a more “bespoke expansion” with a focus on more localised “Low Emission Neighbourhoods” schemes.
AnRACspokesperson told DeSmog that while it accepted an expandedULEZ“may be required to bring down emissions levels”, it believed that its shorter lead-in time than the originalULEZwould have a “disproportionate impact on those from lower income backgrounds”. When asked whether the Mayor’s current scrappage scheme was sufficient, he said this was “more likely to be a question for Transport for London”.
The spokesperson also said that the “merits of a one-off charge remain debatable” and so-called “road user charging”, which would reflect the number of miles being driven in theULEZby non-compliant vehicles, should be explored.
Responding to an earlierconsultationon the initial implementation of theULEZ, it said that while it supported the “principle of theULEZ”, it wanted to see the proposed 2019 start date delayed or a “graduated approach to charging over time”.
Wales: theRACsaidthat while it is “in principle” supportive ofCAZs “where they target the most polluting vehicles”, it questioned whether plans to reduce the speed limit to 50mph on parts of theM4would improve “harmful” nitrogen dioxide levels.

In March 2020, itdescribedcurrentCAZpolicies as “expensive, inflexible and ineffective” and requiring reform “as a matter of urgency”. It claimed the policy was seeing “hard-working and long-established firms go out-of-business”. The organisation’s Policy Director Duncan Buchanan has alsocalledthem an “anti business tax grab”.
In its “2020 Budget Submission”, it argued that the sector’s investment in the latest “EuroVI” lorries, which it calls “Ultra Low Emission”, had “reducedNOx from lorries by around 60%”.
TheRHAsaid thatCAZs had become a “case study in how not to drive change in a sustainable way” because of its “demands on local authorities” and the “discriminatory targeting” of sectors such as road haulage.
The document also claimed that the policy is causing a “cliff-edge” in the resale values of older vehicles, arguing that it should “respect the natural lifecycles” ofHGVs. It further argues that charges imposed on older models should be phased in gradually between 2020 and 2024 in order to stabilise resale values and incentivise the use of newer, cleaner models.
In its 2018annual report, theRHAclaimed that it was a “major influencer” in Southampton’s decision to abandon a chargingCAZ.
“Vigorous campaigning by theRHAhas produced some success: Southampton has scrapped plans to charge lorries – as have Derby and Nottingham – Cardiff is undecided and in Scotland our efforts have moved Holyrood to shelve plans to charge,” it noted.
TheRHAhas alsorecommendedthat local authorities should consider charging only the oldest, dirtiestHGVs and impose lower charges for medium-age models.
In anotherpolicy statement, theRHAclaims that the sector’s “environmental performance has been transformed” in recent years and that “modern lorries are efficient and quiet”.
Elsewhere, theRHA’s Chief Executive argues that the currentCAZpolicy is “counterproductive” because it will divert freight from lorries onto smaller vans, leading to an overall rise in congestion and emissions. He also claimsHGVs and buses account for “just 5% ofNOx emissions” and that there should therefore be a “more proportionate response”.
Reacting to the government’s proposed 2035 ban on new of petrol and diesel cars and vans, announced in February 2020, theRHAtweetedthat there was “a very long way to go before an efficient, cost-effective alternative to diesel-powered trucks can be found”.
Chris Ashley,RHA’s Head of Policy on the Environment and Regulation, told DeSmog the organisation “absolutely supports the aim to improve air quality” but said “faulty” policies had “distorted vehicle replacement cycles”. He called on the government to “re-design and phase-inCAZstandards” so that the industry could play its part in “promoting a sustainable, healthy environment that supports jobs and growth”.
AnRHAspokesperson added that the industry had been left feeling “attacked”, with the second-hand value of their vehicles disappearing and a “patchwork” of different schemes creating further difficulties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"TheRHAbelongsto a coalition of trade bodies representing the road transport sector that has strongly criticised chargingCAZs and wants to see non-charging alternatives implemented instead.

In 2018, the coalitionpublisheda plan entitled “The Way Forward” setting out alternative measures toCAZs, such as smarter traffic management. It arguedCAZs were unfairly targetingHGVoperators and met with Transport Minister Jesse Norman and Environment Minister Therese Coffey to discuss the recommendations.
The coalition has alsopublisheda “factsheet” arguing that there are currently no viable alternatives to diesel forHGVs and that small and medium sized businesses would be worst affected byCAZs. It also criticised the charging system for not distinguishing between different types of older diesel lorries.
The factsheet said that lorries were being “asked to bear the greatest burden in reducing emissions”, despite not being the only source ofNOx, and that the charges would “result in a tax on freight, a tax on business and higher prices for everyone”.",,"TheRHAarguesthat fuel duty is “not the appropriate tool to drive long-term change”, which it says harmsUKcompetitiveness and should be reduced. It instead advocates tackling congestion, reforming “traffic control measures” and encouraging the use of non-diesel vehicles as “viable and effective approaches”.

In March 2021, theRHA’sPolicy Director Duncan Buchanantweetedthat the roads in a recently cancelled low traffic neighbourhood in London “have not been awash with vehicles” and that theLTNwas the “wrong solution that is more about privatising public assets & raising tax”.
In November 2020 theRHA,Fair Fuel UK,Alliance for British Drivers(ABD), and theAPPGon Fair Fuel for UK Motorists and Haulierswroteto Secretary Grant Shapps criticising what it referred to as the “uncalled-for war on the motorist”.

Commenting on the letter,RHAChief Executive Richard Burnettsaid: “We consider that DfT’s £42m investment in ‘green’ road schemes that include additional cycle lanes and road closures to be very poorly timed”. Burnett added that the schemes were causing “additional congestion” and showed “absolutely no consideration for the sector responsible for keeping store shelves full and maintaining the drugs and PPE that hospitals so desperately need to save lives”.

Society of Motor Manufacturers and TradersUnited Kingdom,,,,"On itswebsite, theSMMTstates that the car industry has an “important role in improving air quality and protecting the health and wellbeing of the population”.
In its 2019 “Automotive Sustainability Report”, it notes the progress made in developing low emission technology, claiming that “NO2and particulate matter (PM) from road transport” have both reduced by 76% since 1990.
It also said that since road transport was “the single highest contributor toUKNO2overall emissions”, the industry “recognises the need for continued improvement”.
A 2014 report by theSMMT’s All-Party Parliamentary Motor Groupnotedthat air pollution “poses a serious risk to health” andstressed: “action to address immediate air quality concerns should be a top priority for policy makers, particularly where theUKis in breach ofEUair quality limits”.
Italso said the uptake of Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV) should be promoted and “policies to reduce emissions from other vehicle types such as buses, taxis and trucks” should be put in place.
In itssubmissionto a 2017 inquiry into the government’s framework on Clean Air Zones (CAZ) by parliament’s Environment, Food and Rural Affairs select committee, theSMMTsaid it had “supported government’s approach to a Clean Air Zone Framework which puts forward consistently applied requirements”.
It recommended that the government “play a leading role in setting a framework that promotes a consistent national approach but allows local authorities to implement solutions suitable for local needs”.
However, it said there should be “sufficient timing for industry, consumers, vehicle users and businesses to adjust to implementation requirements of Clean Air Zones”.
It also welcomed the “focus on non-charging elements within government’s plan” and said alternative measures should be explored, including “investment in roads and improvements to road design”.
Since then, theSMMThas made a number of criticisms ofCAZs, holding them partly responsible for a decline inUKcar sales. It hasarguedthat “confusing messages on clean air zones have taken their toll on buyer confidence”, compounding political and economic uncertainty. Chief Executive Mike Hawes hassaidthis has not been helped by the “patchwork decision-making at local government level”.
In a statement to DeSmog, theSMMT’s Chief Executive Mike Hawes said it was committed to pursuing “a zero emission future” for its members but argued that some of the government’s current policies were not the right way to achieve this goal.
“Getting to zero is about market transformation, and a sustainable transition that supports consumers and businesses on the journey will require the full range of powertrains. Proposed blanket bans or penalties, which don’t distinguish between the latest vehicles and decades-old technologies, will cause confusion and undermine fleet renewal, which has already stalled during the coronavirus crisis.
“Instead, what’s needed is a clear and consistent national approach to clean air policies, which gives consumers and commercial fleet operators confidence to upgrade to the latest, cleanest vehicles that best suit their needs – alongside improvements to traffic flow and investment in the charging network”, he said.",,"As part of its lobbying activities, theSMMTruns the All-Party Parliamentary Motor Group in parliament.

Pointing to its own modelling, theSMMTclaimed a 2030 ban would causeUKcar sales to drop from 2.3 million in 2025 to only about 800,000 in that year. A 2035 ban would reduceUKcar sales to about 1.2m in that year, it claimed, compared with more than 2 million if a 2040 deadline was allowed.
In 2017, when the proposed target was 2040, theSMMTwarnedthat the sector could be undermined if it did not have enough time to adjust. It said: “Outright bans risk undermining the current market for new cars and our sector”.
TheSMMTargued that diesel cars have an “important role to play in addressing climate change” in its 2019Sustainability Report. The organisation has previously condemned what it calls an “anti-diesel agenda”,claimingthat around half of the rise in average carbon dioxide emissions for new cars sold in theUKwas attributable to the decline in diesel demand.
Researchon cars’ “real-world” emissions published by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2018foundthat even the latest Euro 6 diesel vehicles had significantly higherNOx emissions than petrol equivalents and exceeded emissions limits.
TheSMMTargued in a September 2019reportthat commercial vehicle operators should “have access to a range of new and existing technologies including diesel, hydrogen and natural gas methane”.
In 2017, theSMMTcriticisedthe “backlash against cleaner, low emission diesels” and said the government should “create the right policies and incentives to encourage all low emission vehicles irrespective of fuel type”.
In itssubmissionto a parliamentary select committee inquiry into the government’s Clean Air Zone Framework, it saidCAZs should be “technology neutral”, defending the role that the latest diesel vehicle models could play in providing “significant emission reductions”. It argued that the government should “avoid an approach that discriminates against” the latest Euro 6 emissions standards.
Tests commissioned in 2018 by the consumer group Which?foundthat many new diesel models exceed the legal limits forNOx under these standards. TheSMMT’s Chief Executive rejected the “non-official” findings and said only the officialEUtests could “accurately compare models on a like-for-like basis”.

In a September 2019email bulletinto supporters, the group’s Grassroots Campaign Manager wrote that it has “long argued that clean air zones do not work and are merely a revenue raiser for government”.
In ablog postonCAZs, aTPAPolicy Analyst criticised the environmentalNGOClientEarth, whose legal actions against the government’s air quality strategy forced it to set out a framework for the introduction ofCAZs, describing the charity as a “trendy East LondonNGO” that is “manipulating developing countries”.
On its website, itlistsone of its highlights as running a “grassroots campaign to oppose a new £100 ‘clean air’ charge in Southampton”, one of theUK’smost polluted cities, arguing that “taxes and levies” should not be “the default answer to real problems”.
Elsewhere, it describesCAZs as “clever wheezes” used by councils looking to raise revenue but hesitant to increase council tax. TheTPAargues the schemes are based on the “mistaken belief it will be the best way to cut pollution”. It has alsocondemneda Labour Party proposal to introduceCAZs around hospitals as “callous” and “another attack on hard-up taxpayers”.
In 2018, theTPAproduced abriefing paperclaiming there was no clear evidence thatCAZs are effective. It claimed London’s Low Emission Zone (LEZ), introduced in 2008, had only led to a short-term increase in vehicle upgrades. It selectively quoted a study stating that theLEZhad made “no discernible differences” toNOx concentrations, without mentioning a decrease in particulate matter levels.
It also cited an out-of-date study that found the zone had not reducedNOx levels and therefore had no impact on children’s health, because an increase in traffic over the time period had cancelled out emissions reductions per vehicle. A more recentstudyfound theLEZhad reducedNOx levels but not enough to improve children’s respiratory health.
ATPAPolicy Analyst hasarguedCAZs are “incredibly regressive” because buses are “relied upon by poorer households, the elderly, and people with disabilities”.
The group hassaidlocal authorities should instead be “looking at alternative ways to tackle pollution, such as improving transport infrastructure to reduce congestion”.
It has alsosuggestedintroducing tougher laws against vehicle idling and advocated demand-based pricing for parking space, as well as “shore power” for ships in ports such as Southampton.
Although experts agree these measures can help reduce air pollution, organisations such as the British Lung Foundationarguecharging Clean Air Zones are the “most effective and quickest way to reach legal limits”.Researchby the Centre for Cities shows that schemes like London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone have cut nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations significantly.

The grouporganisedan action day in Bristol to oppose plans for a workplace parking levy, attended by representatives from theFederation of Small Businesses, the Association of British Drivers and the Freedom Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.desmog.com/air-pollution-taxpayers-alliance/,,TheTPAisopposedto workplace parking levies as a means of tackling congestion in cities. It argues the schemes only have a short-term impact on traffic and has implied they are a way to “drive custom towards the council’s parking businesses”. The group hasdescribedthem as “nothing more than revenue raisers for councils at the expense of businesses and their hard working employees”.,https://www.desmog.com/air-pollution-lobbying-database/
United Cabbies GroupUnited Kingdom,,,,"TheUCGhasexpressedsupport for improving air quality in London, with its General Secretary Trevor Merralls saying in a 2019 article the taxi trade was “committed to reducing its contribution toNOx [nitrogen oxide] emissions, and meeting its obligation to reduce these harmful levels of emissions to help clean up the air all Londoners breath”.
However, Merralls also argued that the “majority of the trade cannot afford” electric taxis and said it was “totally opposed” to a proposal to reduce the age limit on older taxis from 15 to 12 years, designed to accelerate the transition to cleaner vehicles. He claimed it would have a “massive detrimental impact on the trade”, reducing the second-hand value of taxis by tens of millions of pounds and putting “many drivers’ future financial security at risk”.
The group instead recommended retrofitting older Euro V diesel taxis and converting vehicles to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).LPGcan help reduce emissions but most petrol stations do notsellit. A scheme in Birmingham in 2016converted63 diesel taxis, costing £8,000 each.
LPGconversions have also beencriticisedby theLicensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, London’s main taxi association, as being a “halfway house” and a “short term measure”, with conversions having been “historically unreliable”.
In 2018, itcriticisedHackney Council for restricting diesel taxis from using several roads in the Shoreditch area, arguing that the taxi trade had not been given “time to adjust”.
TheUCGhasorganisedprotests against both the growth in private hire vehicles (PHVs) in London and the city’s air quality strategy, claiming that the “improper actions and policies of [Transport for London] are causing widespread gridlock and congestion all day every day throughout London”. Elsewhere, it has blamed London’s air pollution on traffic management and transport policies implemented by TfL, which it says are causing the city to “grind to a halt”. It has also claimed cycle lanes “increase pollution not lower it” and that 20mph speed limits “cause about 30% more pollution”.
In 2017, the grouporganiseda blockade in protest at plans to restrict vehicles, including licensed taxis, from accessing Bank station.
Inresponseto a consultation on proposals for licensed taxis andPHVs under the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), theUCGopposed setting a “zero emissions capable” standard for new licensed taxis from 2018, but supported it forPHVs. Along with the company Autogas, which supplies automotive liquified petroleum gas, the industrial unionGMB, and carmaker Toyota, it said the date was too early.
TheUCGwas one of only two stakeholders who opposed the retrofitting of 400 Euro V buses, the other beingGMB.
In 2014, the grouptweetedthat theULEZwas “another hair brained scheme created by @MayorofLondon to dupe Londoners”.
The group alsoopposesa planned levy on drivers accessing Heathrow Airport to reduce air pollution and has worked with fellow taxi associations theLTDAandLCDC, and unions Unite andRMT, to challenge the plans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The United Cabbies Group (UCG) was formed in 2010 by licensed taxi drivers who were “frustrated by the way the trade was being treated”, according to itswebsite. Its committee is composed solely of working taxi drivers.
Although theUCGhas said it is committed to reducing air pollution, it has opposed various measures introduced as part of London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone. It has also organised protests against schemes designed to restrict vehicles from certain parts of London. It has claimed cycling infrastructure and 20mph speed limits cause congestion and worsen air pollution.
The group is active in lobbying policymakers, stating on itswebsitethat it has “spent the past two years lobbying on behalf of the trade in the Commons and the Lords and will continue to do so”.
It has strongly opposed the operations of ride-hailing company Uber, calling for its license to be revoked. In 2019, itlosta legal challenge claiming that a judge who granted the company a short-term permit was biased.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TheUCGis aregisteredmutual society but has not published any financial reports.,,,,,,,"January 2017
