"APCO WorldwideUnited States, International",,,,"According todocuments available at the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents library, APCO Associates released their revised plan for launching The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC) in October 1993. According to the document, “Goals and Objectives” for the media plan included: “(i) raise the awareness level of the use of unsound science in public policy decision making among target audiences; (ii) educate publics on the impact of this issue; and (iii) lay the groundwork and provide an environment for a successful grassroots mobilization effort to assist Phillip Morris with its issues national and in target states.”16“REVISED PLAN FOR THE PUBLIC LAUNCHING OF TASSC (THROUGH 930000),”APCO Associates, October 15, 1993. Retrieved from Truth Tobacco Industry Documents. Bates No. 2045930493-2045930504.
The document outlines the following objectives:
George Monbiot reported atThe Guardianthat TASSC arose out of a need of Phillip Morris to oppose public smoking bans. In a February, 1993 memo, the tobacco company’s senior vice president of corporate affairs, Ellen Merlo, sent a letter to William I Campbell, Philip Morris’s chief executive officer and president, explaining: “Our overriding objective is to discredit the EPA report … Concurrently, it is our objective to prevent states and cities, as well as businesses, from passive-smoking bans.”18George Monbiot. “The Denial Industry,”The Guardian, September 19, 2006.Archived March June 10, 2017. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/GPdVL
To accomplish this, Merlo had hired the public relations company APCO. APCO warned that “No matter how strong the arguments, industry spokespeople are, in and of themselves, not always credible or appropriate messengers,” reported Monbiot. To get around this, they suggested that PM needed to create the impression of a “grassroots” movement to fight “over regulation.”19George Monbiot. “The Denial Industry,”The Guardian, September 19, 2006.Archived March June 10, 2017. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/GPdVL
They proposed setting up a “national coalition intended to educate the media, public officials and the public about the dangers of ‘junk science’. Coalition will address credibility of government’s scientific studies, risk-assessment techniques and misuse of tax dollars … Upon formation of Coalition, key leaders will begin media outreach, eg editorial board tours, opinion articles, and brief elected officials in selected states.”20George Monbiot. “The Denial Industry,”The Guardian, September 19, 2006.Archived March June 10, 2017. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/GPdVL
APCO requested $150,000 for its own fees, and $75,000 for the coalition’s costs to found the group, write mission statements and  “prepare and place opinion articles in key markets.”21George Monbiot. “The Denial Industry,”The Guardian, September 19, 2006.Archived March June 10, 2017. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/GPdVL
APCO hoped to “establish an image of a national grassroots coalition” for TASSC. This creation of an artificial grassroots movement is now commonly referred to as“astroturfing.”APCO also circulated a sheet of answers, drafted by Philip Morris, to respond to any hostile media inquiries.

In 1995, theAmerican Petroleum Instituteand other trade associations tied to the fossil fuel industry hired Burson-Marsteller to fight stricter air quality regulations proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency.76Jo Warrick. “A Dust-Up Over Air Pollution Standards,”The Washington Post, June 17, 1997.Archived April 16, 2023.

Burson-Marsteller created TV and radio ads attributed to FCAP in the battle over EPA’s air pollution regulations. Burson-Marsteller also heavily publicized studies commissioned by FCAP showing that air quality was improving; articles discussing these studies showed up in local papers across the country in the late 1990s.80“Georgia’s air cleaner than expected,”Atlanta Business Chronicle, May 20, 1997.

1993
In 1993, a division of Burson-Marsteller called the Advocacy Communications Team organized a public relations campaign to defeat a proposed BTU tax, which would have reduced greenhouse gas emissions.88Michael Wines. “Tax’s Demise Illustrates First Rule Of Lobbying: Work, Work, Work,”  The New York Times, June 14, 1993.Archived February 5, 2012.

Like otherastroturf organizations, it signed up other members to give the appearance of a broader coalition, rather than just representing industry interests.
In order to persuade Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee to oppose the BTU tax, Burson-Marsteller sent more than 45 staff members to 23 states to drum up opposition to the proposed tax.90Michael Duffy. “I Hear You, I Hear You,”Time, June 21, 1993.Archived April 16, 2023.

Burson-Marsteller also ran advertisements featuring local businesses opposing the tax.
“Ten years ago, you could have used 10 to 15 lobbyists to kill this thing on Capitol Hill,” Jim McAvoy, senior vice-president of Burson-Marsteller’s Advocacy Communications Team, told Time Magazine in 1993. “Now you have to hire 45 people and send them to 23 states.

One example, according toBloomberg, wasJuly 2014 testimony by Glassman that “meshed perfectly” with the talking points of an affiliate of DCI group he was working for at the time. In his testimony, Glassman argued that Argentina was trying to renege on its debt, and also accused Puerto Rico of the same thing. Glassman never mentioned that he was working for an affiliate of DCI group whose clients at the time included a $25 billion hedge fund that had a dispute with Argentina, and another that was suing Puerto Rico.15Zachary Mider and Ben Elgin. “How Hedge Funds (Secretly) Get Their Way in Washington,”Bloomberg, January 25, 2018.Archived January 28, 2018.

It was a pattern of campaigns where DCI group worked with large hedge funds by crafting what appeared as grass-roots support. Without disclosure, “the targets of these campaigns—administration officials, media ‘thought leaders,’ and lawmakers—didn’t know they were being lobbied, much less who paid for it.”16Zachary Mider and Ben Elgin. “How Hedge Funds (Secretly) Get Their Way in Washington,”Bloomberg, January 25, 2018.Archived January 28, 2018.

“DCI rounded up ordinary Americans who agreed with its clients and marched them into lawmakers’ offices to lend a veneer of grass-roots support.

As outlined by The Conference Board, the campaign aimed to encourage people, especially women, to pursue STEM careers to address anticipated recruitment challenges stemming from projected shortages in STEM talent. The campaign used female leaders at Chevron to act as ambassadors for STEM careers and encouraged Chevron employees to upload “thank your role model” videos to a dedicated platform. The campaign utilized various platforms, including social media and the hosting of events.258“Chevron/McGarryBowen | The 2019 Excellence in Marketing and Communications Awards,”The Conference Board, September 27, 2019.

Dentsu’s McGarryBowen ran the global “We agree” campaign for Chevron in 2010. McGarryBowen intended this campaign to improve the company’s image after Big Oil suffered a reputational blow due to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The ads featured slogans intended to replicate those used by anti-industry groups, e.g., “oil companies should put their profits to good use,” with the words “we agree” stamped over them. The ads featured topics such as community development and investment in renewables. Non-profit groups signed some of the ads, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and Cleantech Open (which promotes green technologies).262Ben Casselman. “Chevron Ad Campaign Answers Critics Head-On,”The Wall Street Journal, October 18, 2010.

One 1993 communications plan drawn up by Edelman for the Tobacco Advisory Council (TAC) outlined a strategy for “Communicating the Case for Tobacco“:37“Communicating the Case for Tobacco: Review and Forward Planning for TAC,”Edelman Public Relations Worldwide, March 27, 1993.

“The message that the smoker needs to hear is that smoking is a normal and rational activity. We must seek to replace the image of smokers as an embattled minority on the defensive by the recognition thatsmokers are a significant body of people who choose to smoke and whose wishes should therefore be taken into account.” (Emphasis in original).
View some key documents referenced by Tobacco Tactics below:
The Tobacco Alliance
One of Edelman’s key activities fwas running the day-to-day operations of the Tobacco Alliance in the U.K., as part of a contract with the Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association. Asummary by the Tobacco Advisory Council (TAC) in a 1983 workshopoutlined Edelman’s involvement:38“How to set up a Tobacco Alliance,”Tobacco Alliance, September 20, 1983. Retrieved from UCSF Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library Bates No. 2501021530-2501021532.
That document outlined “precise objectives” of the Alliance:
In January 1983, Edelmanprepared a storyboard for the Tobacco Alliancethat opposed tax increases on cigarettes and framed arguments by the “anti-smoking movement” as a threat to freedom.39“Tobacco Alliance Audio-Visual,” Daniel J Edelman Limited. Retrieved from UCSF Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library Bates No. 303706484-303706506.
“Freedom is based on the right to choose – and that includes whether or not to smoke. To have such rights eroded is to hasten the day when all our freedoms are threatened,” one slide suggested. “The anti-smokers also seem blind to the serious consequences for jobs if their movement succeeds,” another slide added.

Second Hand Smoke
In the late 1980s, Edelmanhelped produce a bookletthat claimed environmental tobacco smoke (secondhand smoke) was not a proven health hazard.41“Smoking at Work,”Daniel J Edelman Incorporated. 1987. Retrieved from UCSF Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library Bates No. 500889783-500889789.
“There is no scientific consensus that tobacco smoke in the air (environmental tobacco smoke or ETS for short) is harmful to health,” the document claimed. “In the workplace, where smoking prevalence is likely to mirror that of the population as a whole, anti-smokers are presenting smoking as a minority practice, allegedly hazardous to non-smokers. Anti-smokers hold that the solutions to non-smokers’ exposure to ETS are bans on smoking, restrictions or segregation. This is not so; the issue is not clear-cut and there are insufficient scientific data to justify restrictive measures.”
It concluded: “Environmental tobacco smoke is not a proven health hazard: it may be presented as one by anti-smoking activists whose motives are questionable.”

2011
In 2011, MediaCom partnered withWiredmagazine andDiscovery Channelto produce “Earth 2050: The Future of Energy,” a television special for Shell.92“Shell Oil Company | Earth 2050: The Future of Energy,”The One Club.Archived August 20, 2023.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/srnYEThe segment, directed by Michael Epstein, Lilibet Foster, and Nathaniel Kahn, showcases “the energy challenges our world [will face] over the next 40 years” as a result of impending global population growth, according to a press release fromWiredmagazine. The press release states:
“By the year 2050, the world’s population will reach nine billion. The demand on the world’s resources – energy, first and foremost – will be severe. But the road from now to then doesn’t need be bleak. There is a path to a future filled with opportunities, with amazing individuals and extraordinary projects leading the way.”93“Presenting ‘Energy 2050,’”Wired.Archived August 21, 2023.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/g6AEE.
The “Earth 2050” special showcased the benefits of Shell products, including Shell/Raízen ethanol, and spotlighted technological innovations that could reduce CO2emissions, like digital mapping and self-driving cars to make commuting more efficient and improve fuel economy. It also presented Masdar City, thefailed zero-carbon cityin the UAE desert, as a renewable energy-powered urban utopia.94Suzanne Goldenberg. “Masdar’s zero-carbon dream could become world’s first green ghost town,”The Guardian,February 16, 2016But despite showcasing Masdar as a fossil-free ideal, the segment emphasized that a world without fossil fuels is just that, an ideal, repeatedly underscoring the necessity and reliability of fossil fuels. Referencing the solar technologies at Masdar, the documentary noted:
“There’s just one problem: neither of these solar technologies work at night. So, Masdar needs to draw power from the grid when the sun goes down. And that power comes from natural gas. The reality is, it’s just not yet possible to power Masdar entirely without fossil fuels” (at the 36:16 – 39:40 minute mark)
Despite touting its commitments to researching and developing “cleaner fuels” in Earth 2050, Shell’s investment in renewables to date has been negligible. According to GlobalWitness, just 1.5 percent of Shell’s capital expenditure has gone to renewables, with the vast majority of the division’s resources devoted to gas.95Oliver Milman. “Shell’s actual spending on renewables is fraction of what it claims, group alleges,”The Guardian,February 1, 2023.Archived August 21, 2023.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/UfsXq

The New York Times, in an article based on interviews with formerFTIemployees, internalFTIdocuments, and website registration information, found thatFTIconsulting had been involved in the operations of “at least 15 current and past influence campaigns promoting fossil-fuel interests in addition to its direct work for oil and gas clients.”43Hiroko Tabuchi. “How One Firm Drove Influence Campaigns Nationwide for Big Oil,”The New York Times, November 11, 2020.Archived November 13, 2020. Archive URL:https://archive.vn/yQCpL
Hiroko Tabuchi wrote in theNew York Timesarticle thatExxonMobilmay have had a larger role than previously advertised inFTI‘s Energy In Depth campaign:44Hiroko Tabuchi. “How One Firm Drove Influence Campaigns Nationwide for Big Oil,”The New York Times, November 11, 2020.Archived November 13, 2020. Archive URL:https://archive.vn/yQCpL
While on the surface,FTI‘s campaigns appeared to “amplify local voices or speak up for regular people,” on closer investigation, groups “were part of a network of corporate influence campaigns designed, staffed and at times run byFTIConsulting, which had been hired by some of the largest oil and gas companies in the world to help them promote fossil fuels.”
These included a 2018 push byFTI‘s project, the Main Street Investors Coalition warning “that climate activism doesn’t help mom-and-pop investors in the stock market” and campaigns by Texans for Natural Gas and the Arctic Energy Center in 2017 to support fracking and advocate for on-shore and offshore drilling in Alaska.
A spokesman forFTIclaimed the group had always been transparent, commenting: “We hide behind no one.” An Exxon spokesman would not comment, claiming the New York Times reporter was biased against the fossil fuel industry.
Texans for Natural Gas describes itself as a local organization representing “citizens and officeholders, business owners and students” and is funded by oil and gas companies including Exxon subsidiaryXTOEnergy. Elizabeth Caldwell, listed as a “a spokeswoman for the grass-roots organization,” is also a director atFTI.
Other campaignsFTIwas behind included:45Hiroko Tabuchi. “How One Firm Drove Influence Campaigns Nationwide for Big Oil,”The New York Times, November 11, 2020.Archived November 13, 2020. Archive URL:https://archive.vn/yQCpL
Tabuchi also uncovered how anFTIgroup called StratCom, short for Strategic Communications, had tracked the activities of environmental protesters on behalf of Apache Energy, who was seeking to drill near Balmorhea State Park in Texas.
As part of those efforts,FTIalso created a fake Facebook profile in the name of “Susan McDonald” to keep track of protestors. The account “was also intended to helpFTIkeep tabs on activists, formerFTIemployees said.” While its friends list included one current and one formerFTIemployee.
Former StratCom employees also said the group had used strategies to influence public discourse. For example, an internal document dated November 20, 2015 laid out possible roles for communicators such as “The “Semantic Nitpicker,” as the document explained, who “asks an endless series of questions.” The “Dog Typing on a Keyboard” uses “very poor grammar, spelling and punctuation and posts frequently to clutter up the thread and make it hard to read.”
Other strategies they employed included purchasing targeted social media ads leading to the since-shut-down Arctic Energy Center website that promoted drilling in Alaskan waters and in the Arctic National Wildlife refuge. Exxon was reportedly a backer of the Center. A 2016FTIpresentation included a draft budget showing Exxon scheduled to contribute $120,000 over six months on social media platforms.
The New York Timesalso detailedFTI‘s involvement in Main Street Investors, a group claiming to represent small investors and created by industry groups including theNational Association of Manufacturers (NAM).
FTIworked withNAMon a study, written by employees ofFTI‘s wholly owned subsidiary Compass Lexecon, that argued against environmental shareholder resolutions.
FTIalso worked with theIndependent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA)to form DivestmentFacts.com, a website fighting against divestment from fossil fuels. Several papers published on the website were written by professors who also worked for Compass Lexecon.

One reporter, speaking on the condition of anonymity withHuffPost, discussed events that happened at a party where Barak had invited other journalists who were covering the trial:
She suggested that Barak seemed to be fishing for reporters’ views on Monsanto and the trial,HuffPostreported. When reporters looked into Barak’s background, they found on LinkedIn that she worked forFTIConsulting—among whose clients included Monsanto. When the inquiring reporter contacted Bayer, Monsanto’s parent company (and also aFTIclient), Barack’s LinkedIn changed to describe her as a freelancer.
“Monsanto has also previously employed shadowy networks of consultants,PRfirms, and front groups to spy on and influence reporters. And all of it appears to be part of a pattern at the company of using a variety of tactics to intimidate, mislead and discredit journalists and critics,”HuffPostnoted.

Dempsey and Michael Sandoval reportedly called Marco Simons, general counsel for EarthRights International, who was representing Colorado communities in a lawsuit seeking damages from Exxon. Their action “potentially runs afoul of ethics rules for both the legal and public relations industries, and appeared to be a fishing expedition for information about Simons’ clients in that suit.”
In the call, recorded and released by EarthRights, Sandoval confirmed thatWestern Wireis run byFTIConsulting staff and run byFTIunder a contract. According toClimate Liability News, “the two men pressed for an interview even though Simons quickly said he couldn’t talk to them if they represented Exxon in any way. When they evaded the question, Simons refused to comment.”
Simons pressed the consultants about Exxon’s representation on the board ofWEA. Simons asked if Exxon is a Western Energy Alliance member, to which Sandoval responded:  “I’m not privy to the membership of, of the Western Energy Alliance.”
Following this interchange, Sandoval put Matt Dempsey on the line to answer further questions. Dempsey asked Sandoval if he was inquiring on Exxon’s membership as a lawyer representing Boulder, or for his personal information:

In 2019 Group SJR created two campaigns for ExxonMobil that mimicked popular social media trends.
Group SJR’s “Natural Gas PB&J” video ads for ExxonMobil targeted Gen Z audiences. The videos were based on Buzzfeed’s “Tasty” videos, popular with young audiences at the time. These videos compared the complementary flavors of peanut butter and jelly to natural gas as a complement to renewable energy: “Natural gas and renewable energy work great on their own but better together. Kind of like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.” The videos ran on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter. The U.S. House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee described this campaign as “greenwashing” in an investigation into how PR firms aid the fossil fuel industry to mislead the public.140“The Role of Public Relations Firms in Preventing Action on Climate Change,” Appendix 2,House Natural Resources Committee Staff Report, September 14, 2022.Archived May 11, 2023.

The awards submission from Universal McCann and T Brand Studio for the Unexpected Energy campaign began with “The general population has developed preconceived notions about ExxonMobil without truly understanding the breadth and depth of the company’s commitments to climate solutions.”
In order to fix the public’s misunderstanding of Exxon’s climate commitments, Universal McCann turned to T Brand Studio “to reach our target audience where content would be in a ‘Timesian’ voice.” This involved an ExxonMobil takeover of the science section of the New York Times print edition, ads in the New York Times’ popular “The Daily” podcast, one-minute videos, and longform, journalistic-style advertisements.10T Brand Studio, Universal McCann and ExxonMobil. “The Future of Energy? It May Come From Where You Least Expect[Paid Post],”The New York Times.Archived January 15, 2019. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/Fy0Jr
While the ExxonMobil campaign includes a disclaimer that the editorial and news staff did not contribute to the ads, the award submission noted that the campaign was able to benefit from the New York Times’ credibility: “Working with the NYT to create compelling and engaging content that mirrored the award-winning journalism of the world-renowned publication ensured authenticity, credibility and relevance, and was ultimately more impactful to the audience.”
T Brand Studio relied heavily on the idea that ExxonMobil was investing in renewable energy. Despite ExxonMobil’s claims it was increasing investment in this area, the company did not disclose any money spent on clean energy between 2009 to 2020.11Mei Li, Gregory Trencher, and Jusen Asuka. “The clean energy claims of BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell: A mismatch between discourse, actions and investments,” PLoS ONE 17(2): e0263596, 2022.Archived February 26, 2022. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/qvQrEThe awards submission noted that T Brand Studio worked specifically on the narrative that ExxonMobil was researching how to make clean energy from algae:
“T Brand’s first-ever stop-motion production featured a futuristic world with 3D-printed objects and laser-cut acrylic backgrounds showcasing how algae and farm waste could one day fuel a sustainable energy future. The high-tech creative approach enacted across the multiplatform program mirrored the innovation of ExxonMobil’s advanced biofuels agenda and ensured that content would stand out in a crowded communications space.”
In February 2023, Bloomberg reported that ExxonMobil had abandoned its algae research.12Ben Elgin and Kevin Crowley. “Exxon Retreats From Major Climate Effort to Make Biofuels From Algae,”Bloomberg, February 10, 2023.Archive URL:https://archive.is/1CjtV

The TV and Youtube ads for “Powering Progress” opened with a man who said, “In the UK, 1.4 million households use 100 percent renewable electricity from Shell.” The ad then switched to a man installing an EV charging point who said, “Shell aims to fit 50,000 chargers nationwide by 2025.” Then a man in a Shell uniform at a gas station said, “And with more electric car charge points coming to Shell forecourts near you, the UK is ready for cleaner energy.”
Adfree Cities complained that the campaign misled consumers by failing to note that a large majority of Shell’s business dealt with fossil fuel extraction, not clean energy. Shell responded to the complaint by stating:
“Because the ads’ purpose was to promote low-carbon energy, [Shell’s media department] believed that any mention of high-carbon Shell products would have been counterproductive. Information about those Shell products would have only served to highlight their existence and availability, and thereby dilute the impact of the ads’ positive environmental message.”16“ASA Ruling on Shell UK Ltd t/a Shell,”Advertising Standards Authority, June 7, 2023.

The Advertising Standards Authority acknowledged that consumers “broadly” knew that a large part of Shell’s business was related to fossil fuels. But the organization also found that consumers knew these corporations were under pressure to transition away from fossil fuels, and could be misled by the extent to which Shell would be relying on renewable energy in the near future.
