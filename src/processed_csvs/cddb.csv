Bloomberg reportedthe 60 Plus Association was involved in organizing letters to theU.S.Securities and Exchange Commission that pushed for limited the power of dissenting shareholders in the corporate voting process. Recently, environmental and social issues including climate change have been key issues for smaller shareholders and silencing such dissenting voices can be valuable for companies, especially those involved in the fossil fuel industry.21Zachary Mider and Ben Elgin. “SEC Chairman Cites Fishy Letters in Support of Policy Change,”Bloomberg, November 19, 2019.
“[A] close look at the seven letters Clayton highlighted, and about two dozen others submitted to theSECby supposedly regular people, shows they are the product of a misleading – and laughably clumsy – public relations campaign by corporate interests,”Bloombergreported.
One of the errors that gave away the campaign had been organized by corporate interests was the insertion of an out-of-context error in theSEC‘s mailing address. That error occurred in at least 20 letters purported to be submitted by ordinary Americans.
Some of those contacted by Bloomberg said they had been contacted by a public affairs firm and had not written the letters themselves.
“They wrote it, and I allowed them to use my name after I read it,” public servant Marie Reed said. “I didn’t go digging into all of this,” referring to her letter’s criticism of proxy advisers, a term she said she wasn’t familiar with when contacted.
Some of the letters cited bySECChairman Jay Clayton included “ long-term Main Street investors, including an Army veteran and a Marine veteran, a police officer, a retired teacher, a public servant, a single mom, a couple of retirees who saved for retirement,” he said at a commission meeting in Washington.
Bloomberg summarized: “That retired teacher? Pauline Yee said she never wrote a letter, although the signature was hers. Those military vets? It turns out they’re the brother and cousin of the chairman of 60 Plus Association, a Virginia-based advocacy group paid by corporate supporters of theSECinitiative. That single mom? Data embedded in the electronically submitted letter says someone at 60 Plus wrote it. That retired couple? Their son-in-law runs 60 Plus.”
Others with their names on the letters included a woman who previously worked at 60 Plus’s accounting firm, a former secretary of 60 Plus, and a number of friends and relatives of 60 Plus president Saul Anuzis. None mentioned their affiliation with 60 plus.
Anuzis acknowledged that 60 Plus had recruited submitters, provided drafts, and in two examples sent letters on members’ behalf. He also said he had received money from coalition members.
“We don’t get paid for specific projects,” he said in an interview. “We get contributions from members who are part of the coalition. We’re not getting paid for a specific letter.”
The letters revealed potential ties to other groups working with the 60 Plus Association. Marie Reed, one of the names who had been cited by Clayton, said that the man who provided her letter said he worked atFSBCore Strategies, a California-based public relations firm. He said he was working on behalf of a group called Protect Our Pensions.

According to the paper’s abstract(PDF):
“While climate can affect the incidence of malaria, it is increasingly clear that man’s economic activities and malaria control strategies play a far larger role in the incidence of the disease. By concentrating on the role played by climate in the spread of malaria, attention and resources are diverted away from activities that could reduce the incidence of the disease far more effectively.”30“Malaria Control and Climate Change in India” (PDF), Liberty Institute/Africa Fighting Malaria/ESEFWorking Paper, October 2002.

It’s creating hatred and resentment between groups. And some of that might still exist with the facts that I hope to show you tonight. But I don’t think it would be at the level of outrage. You know, there are many people who do have very real and painful, horrible experiences from residential schools.

And of course, the mining, the surface mining of the oilsands was the perfect image to contrast that with renewable energy and say this oil is dirty, coal is dirty, gas is dirty, but this wind is clean. It’s beautiful. This solar panel is beautiful. These are clean and they’re free. There’s nobody ever says, hey, wait a minute, these guys are made from those guys so how can this be clean and beautiful and free if it’s made from oil, gas, and coal? But it was a perfect marketing scheme. [00:16:05]
Michelle Sterling:[00:25:50]“In Alberta, we have the perfect example of what climate change is. Go to the Royal Tyrrell Museum, go down to Okotoks and stand by that big rock. That big rock came all the way from Jasper, 400 kilometers. So where did all that ice go? Calgary used to be under two miles of ice. Where did it go? There were no SUVs. So, you know, we have the evidence actually right here in the province to argue against the catastrophe narrative. And, of course, again, that doesn’t mean that humans don’t affect climate. We do, but not catastrophically so. And our impact in terms of the atmospheric concentration is nominal.”[00:26:34][43.9]
Chris Scott:[00:27:01]“So a question comes to mind: what are we willing to sacrifice in the pursuit of what may or may not be largely human impact, and you know in order to change the climate by a margin, that is mostly insignificant. I think this whole thing needs to be relooked at.”[00:27:25]",,,"The Alberta Prosperity Project (APP)describes itselfas “a not-for-profit, non-partisan educational society, uniting all Albertans, businesses, and organizations to protect their prosperity, interests, freedoms, rights, and self-determination.1“Alberta Prosperity Project homepage.

“Some schools have also adopted secret social-transition policies that compel public school educators to affirm the government’s view on sex and gender – a view that denies biological truth, tells children they were born in the wrong body, and requires parents be deceived about their child’s gender-identity confusion. Such policies undermine the fundamental right of parents to direct their children’s upbringing, education, and care.

“An educator should not be forced to refer to students by names or pronouns that do not correspond with the student’s sex or official records if doing so would violate the educator’s religious or moral standards. For the same reason, educators cannot be required to lie to parents and/ or hide critical information from parents about the child’s physical or mental health (e.g., a student’s desire to identify as the opposite sex and/or use a different name or pronouns at school).”38“K-12 Educators’ Guide to First Amendment Freedoms in Public Schools” (PDF),Alliance Defending Freedom,April 4, 2024.

“Mr. Cross is a teacher in Loudoun County and is challenging Policy 8040. This policy was adopted by the Loudoun County School Board before this lawsuit was filed and provides protections to LGBTQ+ students in Loudoun County schools. The Policy includes provisions requiring teachers to use students’ gender-affirming pronouns, which is crucial to the mental health and well-being of trans and gender-expansive children. Mr. Cross spoke in opposition to Policy 8040 at a school board meeting, and refused to comply with the provision requiring teachers to use gender-affirming pronouns, arguing that this requirement violates his free speech rights. He was subsequently suspended, and he then sued to have his job reinstated. The Court ordered his reinstatement, with the Supreme Court of Virginia upholding this order. The case is now back in Loudoun County Circuit Court, with two added plaintiffs Kimberly Wright and Monica Gill, and is challenging the policy itself. Policy 8040 passed during the time Mr. Cross was challenging his suspension.”

“When the Loudoun County public schools proposed a new policy requiring students and teachers to refer to ‘gender-expansive or transgender’ elementary students with whatever pronouns they select, Tanner decided to voice his concern at a school board meeting during the public comment period. Tanner spoke in his personal capacity alongside other Loudoun County citizens to explain how the policy would harm students and teachers by requiring them to say things they believe are not true.
“Less than two days after Tanner expressed his opposition to the policy in a public forum, the school placed him on administrative leave, specifically because of his out-of-school speech,” ADF suggested in its case summary. “Nobody should be punished for expressing concern about a proposed government policy, especially when the government invites comment on that policy.

The New York Timesobtained audio from an anonymous attendeeof a private June 2019 meeting of the IPAA. In the recording, IPAA officials discussed how the flaring of natural gas to obtain profitable oil from wells could negatively affect the industry’s image:14Hiroko Tabuchi. “A Secret Recording Reveals Oil Executives’ Private Views on Climate Change,”The New York Times,September 12, 2020.Archived September 17, 2020.

“‘We’re just flaring a tremendous amount of gas,’ said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, at the Colorado Springs gathering. ‘This pesky natural gas,’ he said. ‘The value of it is very minimal.’
[…]
“The flaring of natural gas represented a ‘huge, huge threat’ to efforts to portray it as a cleaner and climate-friendly source of energy he said, and that was damaging the industry’s image, particularly among younger generations. ‘What’s our message going forward?’ Ness said. ‘What’s going to stick with those young people and make them support oil and gas?’15“Hiroko Tabuchi. “A Secret Recording Reveals Oil Executives’ Private Views on Climate Change,”The New York Times,September 12, 2020.Archived September 17, 2020.

Dan Haley, president of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, commented: “‘Hippies were going to change the world, until they wanted to get a job and buy a BMW. In Colorado, we’ve been kind of playing a game of whack-a-mole. We went from where fracking was the dirty word, and contaminated your water. And we inundated them with information about that and blitzed the TV airwaves,’ he said. ‘Then slowly that changed into a health and safety messaging. And so we’re ramping up our health and safety messaging.‘”17“Hiroko Tabuchi. “A Secret Recording Reveals Oil Executives’ Private Views on Climate Change,”The New York Times,September 12, 2020.Archived September 17, 2020.

Haley described climate change as  “the prism through which everything is being viewed.” According to Haley, “We have to be comfortable talking about it, talking about how we are part of the solution through natural gas. And again, hitting people with emotions hitting them where they’re where their heart is.”18“Hiroko Tabuchi. “A Secret Recording Reveals Oil Executives’ Private Views on Climate Change,”The New York Times,September 12, 2020.Archived September 17, 2020.

Hailey said, “The activists are doing this when they talk about banning fracking in Colorado. They don’t show explosions. They don’t show rigs. They show women and children. We have got to begin playing at that same emotional level or we will not win these battles.”19“Hiroko Tabuchi. “A Secret Recording Reveals Oil Executives’ Private Views on Climate Change,”The New York Times,September 12, 2020.Archived September 17, 2020.

The Washington Postnoted that members of IPAA produce 83% of oil and 90% of natural gas in the U.S., according to spokesman Jeff Eshelman, with 10% of their wells operating on the margins. “With burdensome regulation and increased cost, these wells can be at risk, and that’s a significant source of America’s energy supply,” he said.
Mike Cantrell of the Oklahoma Energy Producers Alliance commented that not all regulations are bad: “Sometimes getting exactly what you want is the very worst thing you can get,” Cantrell said. “Regulation is not our enemy. It is the way we keep faith with the public.”
Not all oil and gas attendees agreed that climate change was a real issue that people must address. One unidentified participant told Mike Barron he had been “brainwashed.”
“You know, catastrophic climate change models don’t work,” this participant said. “And to think the industry would sit back and say nothing about that is just incredible.”

The AFPI’s “Messaging and Data Lab” produced a memo, “The War on American Energy.” This memo described the Biden administration’s energy policy as a “radical climate agenda.” It said that it had caused “soaring energy costs, a teetering electricity grid, and the loss of American energy independence at the hands of foreign dictators.”124“Messaging & Data Lab: The War on American Energy” (PDF),America First Policy Institute, August 22, 2023.

“Fossil fuels are the most reliable and affordable source of energy in America today. They power almost every aspect of the country’s transportation system and generate the majority of our electricity. Rather than doubling down on policies with a proven track record, the Biden Administration is forcing a transition to unreliable and weather-dependent sources of energy.”
It argues for re-opening federal lands and waters for energy development and increasing the amount of oil stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the U.S.’s emergency stockpile of petroleum.126“Messaging & Data Lab: The War on American Energy” (PDF),America First Policy Institute, August 22, 2023.

The memo says that climate change has the “guise of an emergency” and expresses doubts over the reliability of climate scientists, “Radical climate activists say we need aggressive climate action now. But for decades, bureaucrats, scientists, and elites have predicted doom and destruction would occur on certain dates, only to have the dates come and go.

FACT: Even though the Paris Climate Accords’ most ambitious goal seeks to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the UN’s top climate scientist recently admitted that ‘The world won’t end if it warms by more than 1.5 degrees.’”
FACT: This isn’t even close to true. The wind doesn’t always blow, and the sun doesn’t always shine. Only 10.2% of our energy comes from wind, and only 3.4% comes from solar.”
FACT: Where do you think the electricity to charge those EV’s comes from? Almost 60% of America’s electricity is produced by power plants fueled by natural gas and coal. Media bias is real.”

“We oppose any carbon tax. We oppose a carbon tax because it would lead to less income and fewer jobs for American families,” the letter read. “We support the House Concurrent Resolution in opposition to a job-killing carbon tax and urge members to co-sponsor and support this effort.”69“41 Conservative Groups Support Scalise/McKinley Anti-Carbon Tax Resolution,”Americans for Tax Reform, July 18, 2018.

Archive.isURL:https://archive.li/fIaYW
The poll was conducted byMWRStrategies, a lobbying firm whose clients have included Koch Industries and theAmerican Fuel&Petrochemical Manufacturers. The questions implant the idea that consumers are being pushed to buy certain vehicles and that taxpayers are being forced to pay for the federal programs that supportEVsales.76“Poll by Former Koch Lobbyist Skews Public Support for Clean Cars, Electric Vehicles,”DeSmog, June 20, 2018.
For example, one question states that every purchaser of an electric vehicle is paid “75 hundred dollars” by the “taxpayer,” which misrepresents the mechanics of the non-refundable electric vehicle tax credit. The tax credit simply lowers the buyer’s tax rate in the year of purchase — functionally the same way that a home mortgage interest deduction or child tax credit works.77“Poll by Former Koch Lobbyist Skews Public Support for Clean Cars, Electric Vehicles,”DeSmog, June 20, 2018.
Another question claims that the average income of an electric car buyer is $150,000, and then asks whether the respondent thinks it’s “fair” that the buyer should “be paid 75 hundred dollars.” As of 2016, 54 percent ofEVpurchasers have a household income above $100,000, not $150,000. Also not noted, nearly 80 percent ofEVs are leased rather than purchased, and only 38 percent of leases have a household income above $100,000.78“Poll by Former Koch Lobbyist Skews Public Support for Clean Cars, Electric Vehicles,”DeSmog, June 20, 2018.
Below is a sample of one split sample question, where the interviewer uses to different wordings to ask the same question:79“Poll by Former Koch Lobbyist Skews Public Support for Clean Cars, Electric Vehicles,”DeSmog, June 20, 2018.
The first question, set up to make respondents feel a direct personal sacrifice, 29 percent answered that this was “way too much” and 25 percent said it was “about right.” The second question, framed without the direct emotional connection, the percentage of respondents that said it was “about right” rose slightly to 27 percent, and those who said it was “way too much” dropped to 19 percent. Both wordings were misleading, considering a tax credit is not a payment from the government and not all buyers ofEVs get the full value of the tax credit.80“Poll by Former Koch Lobbyist Skews Public Support for Clean Cars, Electric Vehicles,”DeSmog, June 20, 2018.

Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Brian Schatz of Hawaii visited the AEI to discuss a proposal to curb greenhouse gas emissions by taxing them. AEI’s head of energy studies, Benjamin Zycher, argued that the carbon tax would have minimal benefit.
As reported by the AEI, “Zycher argued against the senators’ carbon tax plan, arguing that their emphasis on global benefits led to flawed measurement of the social cost of carbon emissions, that the impact on temperatures would be minimal, and that the rest of the world would have an incentive to free-ride at the expense of the US.”29“To tax or not to tax: Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and Brian Schatz present their American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act,”American Enterprise Institute, June 10, 2015.

Chad Stone, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,commentedthat Zycher’s view was “based on a very skeptical reading of the scientific evidence on global warming and a worldview in which, with rare exceptions like national defense, government activities are almost always rooted in special-interest politics and almost always destructive. That position won’t likely change, and it doesn’t make adherents receptive to a carbon tax of any kind.”30Chad Stone. “Will Republicans Ever Buy a Carbon Tax?”USNews.com, June 12, 2015.

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a complaintwith the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), suggesting that the American Future Fund (AFF) has violated tax law. Groups organized under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code must not make it their “primary purpose” to support or oppose political candidates.[8]
“There is nothing wrong with working to elect Republicans, but you can’t violate the law to do it,”said then-CREWExecutive Director Melanie Sloan. “Given the amount of money the American Future Fund spent on ads in the 2010 congressional elections, it seems clear the primary – if not only – goal of the group is to elect Republicans to Congress.”[9]
“Despite the fact thatAFFrepeatedly told theIRSit had not and did not plan to support or oppose candidates for office or spend any money attempting to influence elections,AFFdid exactly that through the 2010 campaign cycle,”the originalCREWletter alleged. “Because of the serious nature of the tax law violations, theIRSshould consider revoking theAFF‘s tax-exempt status and/or impose appropriate excise taxes and penalties on the organization.[10]

NPR,reporting as part of its “Secret Money” seriesdocumenting spending on 2008 elections, highlighted theAFF‘s ongoing ad campaign against Democratic Senate candidate Mark Udall in Colorado:[11]
“The ad implies Udall is bad on education, needs a ‘reality check,’ and then – curiously – urges him to support Senate bill 12,”NPRreported.[11]
“First of all, the bill was introduced by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) in February and hasn’t gone anywhere since. Second, the bill’s only education provision is an ‘enhanced charitable deducation for corporate contributions of computer equipment for educational purposes.’ Third and perhaps most important, Udall is a member of the House of Representatives, not the Senate. He wouldn’t be able to vote for S. 12 unless he gets elected, an ambition the American Future Fund hopes to thwart.”[11]",,,"The American Future Found (AFF) is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that describes itself as a “multi- state issues advocacy group designed to effectively communicate conservative and free market ideals,”according to its website.[1]
AFFwasfounded in 2007by Nick Ryan, a former advisor to U.S. Rep. Jim Nussle (R-Iowa) and to Rick Santorum’s 2012 presidential campaign.

At a July 2015 meeting in San Diego,ALEC’s energy committee — which includes Mr. Mike Duncan, the president of theAmerican Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity(One of the nation’s top coal lobbying groups) — enacted a model bill designed to directly support state attorneys general who legally challenge President Obama’s climate change plan.
The bill would allow states to create funds, which could be funded by corporate donations, to support legal challenges to the climate change rules. In early 2014, shortly after Obama announced regulations at the White House, West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, announced that a group of at least 15 Republican state attorneys general were preparing a joint legal challenge to the proposal.
Opposition at the time came from a group headed in part byRoger R. Martella Jr., a top environmental official in the George W. Bush administration, andPeter Glaser, a prominent Washington lobbyist, as reported by theNew York Times.TheNYTimes describesALECas an “Important Ally in the effort.”106Coral Davenport and Julie Hirschfeld Davis. “Move to Fight Obama’s Climate Plan Started Early,”The New York Times, August 3, 2015.Archived June 12, 2023.

On Koch, the lawsuit suggests that the company is liable for the various actions of its numerous subsidiaries involved in the manufacturing, refining, and distribution of petroleum products. It also notes:
It also notes that, like numerous other oil companies, “Koch also understood climate-change science, the connection to sales of its fossil fuel products, and the potential for catastrophic consequences before the science was widely understood by the general public.”
It highlights what appeared to be a coordinated effort by companies including Koch to “combat climate change ‘alarmists’ through a campaign focused on science, information dissemination, and politics.” It highlights a2006 memo from the Intermountain Rural Electric Associationthat outlined how Koch Industries was working with other large corporations including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Southern Company, American Electric Power (AEP), and National Association of Manufacturers (NAM).
Shortly after, theD.C.Attorney General’s Officejoined in a similar lawsuit againstBP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell.

As reported in theNew York Times,APIhas “long argued that forcing oil producers and shippers to use newer tank cars and replace older models would impose high costs on the industry and lead to a shortfall in tank car capacity.”
Their petition would challenge the government’s timeline to upgrade/retrofit older tank cars with newer safety features to prevent spills and derailments in the future. It also challenges a requirement that tank cars be equipped with new electronic braking systems or be faced with operational restrictions.

The American Petroleum Institute released anupdated “Primer” (PDF) on Hydraulic Fracturing, bearing the same title as their previous reports (“Hydraulic Fracturing: Unlocking America’s Natural Gas Resources”). According to the report, Fracturing is “largely responsible for changing America’s energy narrative from one of limited options to one of nearly limitless plenty.”
APImakes the claim that “There are zero confirmed cases of groundwater contamination” due to hydraulic fracturing. They also divert blame of earthquakes caused by fracturing, citing studies that found it was “impossible to say with a high degree of certainty whether or not these earthquakes were triggered by natural means or by the nearby hydraulic-fracturing operation.” According toAPI, Fracturing is a “Safe, proven technology.”
Since theAPI‘s Report,the Environmental Protection Agency has released a long-awaited draft of its assessment of fracking’s impact on drinking water. TheEPAfracking assessment found that fracking indeed contaminates drinking water: “From our assessment, we conclude there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources,” theEPAwrote.121Sharon Kelly. “EPA Study: Fracking Puts Drinking Water Supplies at Risk of Contamination,”DeSmog, June 4, 2015.

However, our companies cannot do so if held back by harmful, counter-productive taxes and are restricted from access to domestic oil and natural gas resources that the country urgently needs. … If imposed, these taxes and fees could have a debilitating effect on our economy, when our nation can least afford it.

Americans for Prosperity released an internet ad thanking Governor Pencefor rejecting the federal government’s rule to restrict greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.
IndyStarreportsthis was not the first time Americans for Prosperity supported Pence’s position. In their analysis, they also write the ad “ignores the fact that if Indiana does not submit a plan to comply with the federal rule, the Environmental Protection Agency will impose one on the state. So any of the negative effects the group says will result from the Clean Power Plan would come regardless. And the utility industry has told the Indiana Department of Environmental Management it’s better to have the state figure out how to comply.”82Maureen Groppe. “Truth Squad: Does Koch brothers group’s ad stretch the truth for Gov.

AFPembarked on a nation wide campaign against global warming titled the “Hot Air Tour.”AFPtraveled in a hot air balloon to forty cities in the United States and held events in those cities.
The tour carried the slogan,“Global Warming Alarmism: Lost Jobs, Higher Taxes, Less Freedom.”
During theHot Air Tour,AFPpresident Tim Phillips said thatAFP‘s purpose was to prevent cap-and-trade and other climate change legislation from being passed in government. He declared if any cap and trade legislation were passed it would create a massive tax burden on American citizens, kill the economy, and harmfully infringe on personal freedoms.
In a public address, Tim Phillips stated there would be a $1.2 Trillion tax increase if a cap-and-trade bill was passed and that 1.2-1.8 million jobs would be lost with cap-and-trade legislation. He cited the “American Capital Formation Foundation” as his source. While the American Capital Formation Foundation does not in fact exist, theAmerican Council for Capital Formation (ACCF) does, and it has consistently lobbied in Washington against green initiatives, especially the Kyoto protocol, claiming these actions would have severe effects on the national economy.
On its website, theACCFcalls itself “one of the most influential organizations operating behind the scenes in the Washington policymaking arena.” According toExxonSecrets, between 1998-2006, the American Council for Capital Formation received $1,674,523 from ExxonMobil.103ExxonSecrets Factsheet: American Council for Capital Formation Center for Policy Research, ACCF.Archived November 5, 2011.The grouphas also received funding from Koch foundations.104“About Us,”American Council for Capital Formation.

There is, however, considerable evidence that this legislation will have a disastrous economic effect on the country.” As proof he cites information provided by theInstitute for Energy Research (IER), an organization that has received significant funding from the oil industry.

Indeed, some point to studies showing even the U.N. has recently projected there will be no warming for at least another 10 years as well.

Atlantic BridgeUnited Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Atlantic Bridge Research and Education Scheme – better known simply as the Atlantic Bridge – was founded in 1997 in theUKbyLiam Fox, former Defence Secretary and current International Trade Secretary.
With Margaret Thatcher as its president, the neoconservative think tank’s aim was to promote Atlanticism – a“special relationship”between theUKand United States. A key funder of Atlantic Bridge wasMichael Hintze, the billionaire hedge fund manager, Conservative party donor, philanthropist, and supporter of the climate science denial groupGlobal Warming Policy Foundation, founded by former Thatcher chancellor LordNigel Lawson.
In 2003, the group became a registered charitywith the stated aims: “…..The furtherance of public education on both sides of the Atlantic, in areas of common interest, focusing particularly but not exclusively on free trade, economics, health and science. Research into relations between Europe and North America and their implications for the international community with the aim to raise cultural awareness and improve links’.”
In 2007, the group established aspecial partnershipwith free-market lobby group theAmerican Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), known for producing template pieces of legilsation that reduce protections for the environment and other anti-regulation efforts. At the same time,ALECset up a sister charity in theUS– also known as Atlantic Bridge.
Even though the Atlantic Bridge Project (USA) and the Atlantic Bridge Group (UK) were different organisations, theyoperated extremely closelytogether, promotinglinks betweenUSandUKbased conservatives, and paying for flights and expenses for Liam Fox and other senior Tories to take trips across the Atlantic. Accounts for 2007 for Atlantic Bridge Groupstatethat the “two entities have been set up to mutually support each others aims.”
As theGuardian described:
“To outsiders, the charity may have appeared to be little more than a social club, keen to throw a party in New York to promote Hague’s book on William Wilberforce or hold a dinner for 14 in parliament’s Club Room – an apparent breach of parliamentary rules. But the group’s members were deeply serious in their beliefs, and Fox was more than happy to promote his neoconservative leanings when abroad.”
The group operated until September 2011 when it was dissolved following a Charity Commission investigation prompted bypolitical blogger Stephen Newton.
In July 2010, the Charity Commission ruled that Atlantic Bridge had been undertaking overly political work –as it put it: “Although it is legitimate for a charity to study, research or educate the public about the ‘Special Relationship’, it is not permissible for a charity to promote a particular pre-determined point of view.”
According tothe Guardian, the charity’s address was given as Fox’s office in the House of Commons.
And as Carbon Briefreported: “The ruling (removed from the Charity Commission’s website but obtainable from them on request) stated that “the Charity’s current activities must cease immediately” and that it needed to make a “clear separation” from Atlantic Bridge Inc (set up byALEC) in theUS.”",https://www.desmog.com/atlantic-bridge/,https://www.desmog.com/climate-disinformation-database/

Many of the member think tanks of Atlas Network have supported climate science denial and have campaigned against legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
The Atlas Economic Research Foundation (AERF) was founded by Antony Fisher in 1981 with the goal of spreading “innovative, market-based perspectives to issues of public policy” globally.
In 1955, Fisher hadfounded the Institute of Economic Affairs(IEA), after conferring with free-market economist F.A. Hayek. Fisher and Hayek were part of theMont Pelerin Society‘s early efforts. IEA became an influential London-based think tank promoting neoliberal ideas of limited government and low regulation.1“Our Story,”Atlas Economic Research Foundation. Archived August 11, 2015.

Atlas Network is the trading name of the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization. Previous names have been the Atlas Foundation and the Atlas Research Foundation. TheInternational Policy Network (IPN)in the UK, also founded by Fisher, is effectively a UK variant of Atlas Network.
According to UK Charity Commission filings (PDF), The Atlas Economic Research Foundation (UK) was working as the International Policy Network, and is registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales, number 262982. In April 2001, with the consent of the Charity Commission, it adopted the working name of The International Policy Network, ‘IPN’, and in December 2004, ‘UK’ was added to the name.The UK Atlas Economic Research Foundation and the IPN UK are no longer listed among UK Charities. and the UK branch was most recently operating with a new name, “Network for a Free Society.” The U.S. Atlas Network appears to be a separate entity from the International Policy Network US Inc., although Atlas Network’s 2010financial recordsreveal that they continued to provide support to IPN.2“Network for a Free Society (previously Atlas Economic Research Foundation (UK) working as The International Policy Network UK) Annual Report and Financial Statements” (PDF),  Year ended 31 December 2010.

Oxley writes that the Kyoto Protocol emissions reductions “would have negligible impact on global emission of carbon dioxide.” He proposes a “practical strategy for Australia,” where he recommends that emissions trading would be an “outdated” strategy, adding: “There is no point in Australia’s allying with the EU alone to support a global warming strategy that cannot work and which reduces global competitiveness.”15“The prospects for global collaboration on climate change” (PDF),APEC.org, January 2005.
He goes on to promote a supposed “debate” on the science of global warming.16“The prospects for global collaboration on climate change” (PDF),APEC.org, January 2005.
“This debate has real substance. A principal indicator of this is the unwillingness of Green groups to engage,” he writes. “The general response from Green groups has been to say the science was settled years ago and that there is a comprehensive consensus among scientists that global warming is occurring and that human activity is the leading contributor. There has been orthodoxy rather than a consensus about the science.”17“The prospects for global collaboration on climate change” (PDF),APEC.org, January 2005.

At the conference, U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel commented, “I believe we are headed down the wrong path in the negotiations for any global climate treaty to be signed in Kyoto, Japan, this December.”
Hagel went on to cite well-known climate change denierRichard S. Lindzen, quoting him as saying “a decade of focus on global warming and billions of dollars of research funds have still failed to establish that global warming is a significant problem.”
Hagel concludes that the “path to Kyoto should be abandoned until we have a better idea of the climate changes we are dealing with and until we can come up with a truly global solution that is fair and equitable for all the nations involved.”20“Countdown to Kyoto” an International Conference on The Consequences of Mandatory Global CO2 Emission Reductions: Remarks by United States Senator Chuck Hagel” (PDF), Retrieved from APEC.org.au.

The “takeover faction” proposed significant changes to the Shimer mission statement, including replacement of references to “active citizenship” and “informed, responsible action” with references to “ordered political liberty such as we enjoy in American democracy.” These changes, among others, alarmed Shimer students, faculty, alumni, and staff members.

A revision of the lawsuit highlighted how the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic “are a harbinger of the types of systemic risks posed by climate change, demonstrating the sweeping and interconnected nature of climate-driven dangers and disruptions, such as the widespread economic harms of sudden global market disruptions, supply chain interruptions, and health care system failures.”
According to Tuerck, “The conflation of the coronavirus and climate crisis, both misleading and far-fetched, leads to an inescapable conclusion: Healey’s climate change litigation is based solely on belief.”
“There simply is absolutely no compelling proof that ExxonMobil faces any immediate or even long-term prospects of declining sales as a result of climate change,” Tuerk also claimed.
Kert Davies, director of the Climate Investigations Center,responded to Tuerck’s op-ed. He responded to Tuerck’s above argument, noting that “While demonstrably false in so many ways, this statement proves Tuerck is stuck in some bygone decade of denial and suggests he has neither read the Massachusetts complaint, nor the internal Exxon documents from the 1970s and ‘80s cited in the complaint, which can be read and downloaded at ClimateFiles.com.  These documents show Exxon’s staff scientists modeling and anticipating how fossil fuel consumption would have to be curtailed to avoid dangerous climate change.  They knew regulations were coming.”17“Tuerck’s critique of Healey fits a pattern,”CommonWealth,August 6, 2020.Archived August 17, 2020.

More than 200 groups, including representatives from farmer, farmworker, environmental justice, climate, environmental, faith-based, and animal welfare organizations signed an open letter to members of Congress inopposition to the bill, which stated in part:
“…this legislation will allow greenhouse gas emissions to continue unchecked and will undermine efforts to build a healthy, sustainable, and resilient food system.99“Over 200 Organizations Reject ‘Growing Climate Solutions Act’,”Food & Water Watch, October 15, 2020.Archived March 19, 2021.

“Carbon markets fail to reduce emissions overall and exacerbate pollution hot-spots in low-wealth communities and communities of color, the groups said. Power plants and industrial polluters, disproportionately located in these communities, purchase credits that allow them to continue burning toxic fossil fuels releasing harmful pollutants that compromise local health and well-being.”
In a press release announcing the open letter, Mitch Jones, Policy Director of Food & Water Action, stated that “the misguided Growing Climate Solutions Act will allow corporations to indulge in more fracking and other forms of fossil fuel pollution, while creating a stream of bogus carbon reduction ‘credits’ that will benefit industrial agriculture and factory farming. Rather than promoting feel good policies that merely perpetuate the status quo, we need bold action from Congress that will create real climate solutions that promote sustainable agriculture and an end to fossil fuels.”

It was founded byMatthew Elliott, founder and former Chief Executive of theTaxpayers’ Alliance, one of the right-wing organisations occupying55 Tufton Street, where Business for Britain is alsobasedas of August 2019.
Initially summarised in a statement signed by over 500 businesses in 2013, BfB’s objective is to provide a forum for business leaders to contribute towards the transition of the UK out of the EU. Elliott laterexplainedthat the group was formed to “demonstrate that the business community was divided on the EU and to combat the general assumption that all business leaders were fanatically pro-EU”.
One of the most significant contributions of BfB to the Brexit debate was the publication ofChange, or goin June 2015, which sought to outline suggestions for trade deals post-Brexit. The editor-in-chief wasMatthew Elliott, and two other drafters of the publication were prominent figures in Vote Leave.

He believes offshore wind energy will be too expensive, and he recently founded the American Coalition for Ocean Protection, which now has chapters in coastal communities in New Jersey and New York.
The groups cited supposed dangers to whales as a reason to halt offshore wind projects. “’If an emotional response is what it takes,’” he said about concern for the whales, “I’m not going to turn them down.'”

“Pielke’s work, similar to Dr. Legates, shows that damages from hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and droughts have not increased in frequency or intensity since the middle of the twentieth century despite warmer temperatures,” CRI claimed.
“We support transparency at publicly funded institutions, and researchers should disclose funding sources when they publish a paper as is the policy at most universities.

“Things that were a bad idea before the pandemic are still a bad idea,” McKitrick said. “People are opportunistically saying, well now we’re in a phase of recovery where we’re looking at introducing policies to support the recovery, and people with this green agenda want to overload their ideas onto what should actually be an agenda running in the opposite direction.”
“Which is, we really need to make a priority of profitable investment, business creation, job creation… In the past, for instance 2008, there was a whole lot of climate policy on the agenda then, and a lot of policymakers around the world realized when the financial crisis hit, ok, we’re going to put all that on the back burner because it’s expensive, so now is not the time to do all that. That should be the reasoning now.”
“With so much stress in the economy, when people realize how much things like the clean fuel standard cost, they’re going to be unhappy that the government is choosing now of all times to implement these things.”
“There’s a lot of sloganeering around it. I mean, you said ‘build back better,’ ‘a resilient recovery’ and all that, and really that’s just using this particular moment in the policy agenda—where we’re looking for governments to come up with a plan—it’s kind of a Trojan Horse where they can say well we’re going to present a recovery plan, but it’s actually just a whole lot of old shop-worn green policy ideas that were a bad idea previously, but we think we might be able to get away with it now because everybody’s expecting us to implement a big policy agenda.”

As later highlighted by theAtlas Network, of which the CCF is a partner, supported the CCF with a grant to fight against Section 91 of the Canada Elections Act which “sought to halt the spread of misinformation during federal elections.”
“The section gave unelected officials the power to fine or even imprison Canadians for posting or sharing information on social media which the government deemed false,” the Atlas Network claimed.
“Atlas Network partner Canadian Constitution Foundation (CCF) recognized the law as a threat to liberty and challenged Section 91 in court. Alongside their litigation, CCF initiated a media campaign to draw public attention to the issue.”

“[M]oney will be spent on top-down controls on our lives that will make the cost of living in Ontario even higher,” Van Geyn warned in her article. “For example, the government is going to require that all new homes and all new commercial office buildings be built with electric vehicle charging stations. This will drive up the cost of housing, something that is already increasingly out of reach for many Ontario families.”
She added, “The government is also going to be changing the Building Code to require that all small buildings become carbon neutral. It’s not quite clear what this means, and indeed, could mean the de facto phase out of natural gas which 76 per cent of homes in the province rely on for heat.”

In a GB News debate titled ‘Is net zero to blame for supermarket shortages?’, CAR26 director Lois Perryarguedthat renewable energy was the reason for the UK’s shortage of tomatoes.
Perry said the price of “everything is going up because of this renewables scam.” She continued: “We’re making our grid intermittent by having to rely on these renewable energies by law and so therefore we’re pushing the price of all of our fuel up.”
She also stated that “Net zero as an ideology isn’t a creeping slow thing … it’s actually a revolutionary thing that wants to completely annihilate what most of us take for granted as our way of life.”
In the debate, Perry voiced her opposition to the government’s moratorium on fracking which she called “absolutely ridiculous.”
When another guest on the panel suggested that other European countries with more stringent net zero targets were still able to stock tomatoes in supermarkets, Perry said, “Well they might be hot,” asserting that in the UK “We haven’t had any warming for 10 years unfortunately.”28“Is net zero to blame for supermarket shortages?,” YouTube video uploaded by user GBNews on February 25, 2023.

Perry later refuted the premise that the ULEZ plan was designed to combat asthma worsened by air pollution, saying: “this whole thing about the ULEZ zones being about health and all of that, that’s rubbish.”
She continued by suggesting that asthma figures had been fabricated to justify ULEZ plans, claiming that “they [the Mayor of London’s office] hadn’t thought that one through before they came up with their nonsense modelling,” adding that “it shows you they’re a bit thick at county hall.”

Lois Perryannouncedthe launch of CAR26’s “Fuel Freedom campaign” in an interview with talkRADIO. She told presenter Mike Graham: “We feel that all our freedom comes from fossil fuels and that people should have the freedom to have a petrol car if they want to or to have gas central heating. They can have a heat pump if they want. It’s all about freedom of choice.”Perry also argued that fossil fuels “need to be debated” and suggested the UK’s closing of coal-fired power stations was threatening the country’s energy security.47“The name CAR26 stands for Climate Analysis Reason and we’re launching a Fuel Freedom campaign.

On behalf of the coalition, Forbes authored an open letter (PDF) criticizing carbon trading on behalf of the Carbon Sense Coalition. The letter, addressed to the Premier and Members, describes carbon dioxide as “harmless … plant [food].”
Forbes also suggests that carbon trading would increase the price of petrol, grain, beef and other farm products, and that carbon trading would result in something “worse than the sub-prime crisis.” It is interesting to note that the Carbon Sense Coalition’s Advisory(PDF)Committee is filled with individuals representing the beef and mining industries.28“Introducing The Carbon Sense Coalition” (PDF),The Carbon Sense Coalition, June, 2007. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
The letter concludes that “There is no consensus on the science of global warming, and no evidence beyond computer models that carbon dioxide is causing or will cause dangerous climate changes. Climate is always changing, and there is no evidence that man has or can affect world climate trends. Therefore there is no basis to embark on a massive dislocation of Queensland’s backbone industries. There are zero proven benefits.”29Viv Forbes. “An Open Letter to Premier Anna Bligh and All Elected Members in Queensland” (PDF),Carbon Sense Coalition, October 9, 2008.

The NGER actwould provide a national framework in Australia to report the greenhouse gas emissions by major corporations.
Forbes suggests that the NGER system (if implemented) should “minimize the data demanded, the people who must report and the matters reported on.” His suggestions include to:31“‘Keep it Simple, Stupid’: A Submission from The Carbon Sense Coalition to the Commonwealth  Department of Climate Change (DOCC) on its proposal for a National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System” (PDF), www.carbon-sense.com, February 11, 2008.  Archived .pdf on file at DeSmogBlog.
The submissions’s conclusion is that there should be an “Independent Enquiry” into climate change science before any de-carbonisation proposals are applied in Australia.
Forbes’s reasoning is that the climate is “unusually benign,” that carbon dioxide has “encouraged plant growth, causing a large increase in food production on earth since the 1850’s (‘the green revolution’).” He also believes that “a period of global cooling is likely.”
Although he mentions “scientists who study the sun,” he does not cite any scientific studies in his report.

Riedle concluded: “The promise of more LNG facilities in the United States also brings the promise of a new era benefiting the U.S. economy and our global allies. Our enormous natural gas resource base ideally positions the United States to compete on a global level for LNG market share while still providing an affordable and environmentally advantageous fuel source for U.S. customers. Free and open trade of U.S. LNG sends the important signal of unencumbered exports to the global market. Artificially limiting LNG exports could undermine commitments to free and open markets as well as lead to complaints in international trade cases in the future.
“A legislative solution to the situation would give companies awaiting an export permit greater regulatory certainty and a clear timetable for moving forward with capital intensive projects – resulting in a boost to the American economy. A concrete regulatory process also signals to the rest of the world that the United States is ready to meet the growing demand for natural gas in the comings months and years. “",,,"TheCenter for Liquefied Natural Gas (CLNG)is a 501(c)(6) organization formed in 2007 and based in Washington D.C.DeSmoghasreportedon CLNG’s industry ties, and connection to the American Petroleum Institute (API).

Senior Fellow and Economist at the Centre for Brexit Policy Catherine McBride wasquotedinThe Daily Expressoutlining plans for an agricultural sector based on carbon capture and storage (CCS). She reportedly stated that: “We need to start rewarding farmers for soil carbon sequestration and planting carbon crops during the winter.”47Gerrard Kaonga. “Boris Johnson urged to reward farmers if he is serious about Britain’s green revolution,”The Daily Express,May 25, 2021.Archived June 1, 2021.

McBride also disputed the efficacy of renewable energy and advocated for the expansion of nuclear power, reportedly stating: “I know a lot of people don’t like this but we really have to expand on nuclear energy in the UK,” and adding: “I believe that doing more small nuclear power plants would be much better than covering the country in solar panels and wind turbines that generally don’t last long enough to really pay back the cost of their production.”

The webpage hosting the letter stated that a “global network of over 1100 scientists and professionals has prepared this urgent message” and that “It is not the number of experts but the quality of arguments that counts.”
The letter questioned the validity of climate models, stating that they “have many shortcomings and are not remotely plausible as policy tools” and “not only exaggerate the effect of greenhouse gases, theyalso ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial.”
The letter also claimed that there is “no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent” and stated that “there is ample evidence that CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly.”
The letter also called carbon dioxide “plant food,” and stated that “More CO2 is favorablefor nature” and that “Additional CO2 […] is also profitable for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide.”

You ought to know that the environmental footprint of ‘renewables’ is crippling.”
The article concluded by dismissing the causal link between carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere and climate change, asking: “how much of the total warming before 1850, the natural greenhouse effect, was not caused by feedback response to greenhouse gases but by the fact – which climate scientists’ calculations overlook – that the Sun produces a far larger feedback response?”

CCMBC president Catherine Swift wrote an article in theNiagara Independenturging business leaders to “speak up against bad government policies.” The article was titled “Hey CEOs, stop ‘just transitioning’ yourselves out of business.”24Catherine Swift. “Hey CEOs, stop ‘just transitioning’ yourselves out of business,”The Niagara Independent, February 17, 2023. Archived February 22, 2023. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/7LggX
“By not pushing back against policies harmful to their businesses, CEOs also enable governments to concoct even more bad policies down the road. In the energy industry, this has culminated in the so-called ‘just transition’ following carbon taxes, tanker bans on the west coast, heavy-handed and confusing regulatory standards, emissions caps, plastic bans and the ‘Clean Fuel Standard’, among others,” Swift wrote.
“Fortunately, a number of brave corporate leaders have begun to speak out against many of the damaging and impractical energy policies being inflicted by governments, such as punitive taxes and regulations that greatly increase costs for businesses and consumers, so-called ESG (environmental, social and governance) regimes that are devastating for smaller firms and costly for all businesses, the ‘just transition’ and other ‘woke’ measures,” she concluded.

Before the film’s Australian debut, Climate scientist Professor Will Steffenreviewed portions of the film forDeSmog.100Graham Readfearn. “Notorious Climate Science Denier Marc Morano Flying to Australia With Misleading Climate Hustle Movie,”DeSmog, July 6, 2017.
Steffen is an emeritus professor at Australian National University and a member of the not-for-profit Climate Council. He said: “This is just the usual rubbish from the usual suspects – a re-hash of misleading and downright incorrect arguments that denialists have trotted out for a long time.”101Graham Readfearn. “Notorious Climate Science Denier Marc Morano Flying to Australia With Misleading Climate Hustle Movie,”DeSmog, July 6, 2017.
Reviewing a section that downplays the role of carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, Steffen noted it “misrepresents how the carbon cycle works” by ignoring how oceans and land absorbCO2– a very basic and well-known mechanism in the carbon cycle.102Graham Readfearn. “Notorious Climate Science Denier Marc Morano Flying to Australia With Misleading Climate Hustle Movie,”DeSmog, July 6, 2017.
Steffen added, “What the film didn’t say is that both oxygen and nitrogen, which comprise about 99 per cent of the atmospheric gases, are transparent toUV, visible and heat radiation. They don’t play a role in the energy balance at the Earth’s surface.”103Graham Readfearn. “Notorious Climate Science Denier Marc Morano Flying to Australia With Misleading Climate Hustle Movie,”DeSmog, July 6, 2017.
Dr. Andrew King, a climate scientist at Monash University in Melbourne, also had an opportunity to look at the film.

The Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)’s Marc Morano released the“2016 State of the Climate Report” (PDF),115“2016 State of the Climate Report” (PDF), CFACT, November 15, 2016.

Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/ZeNRn
The report’s introduction makes a number of assertions, and begins by claiming that “Slightly higher atmosphericCO2levels cannot possibly supplant the numerous complex and inter-connected forces that have always determined Earth’s climate.” According to Morano’s report, there has been no global warming for 18 years,severe weather eventshaven’t increased, we are having more snow,sea levels have not risen, andpolar bears “are doing fine”— virtually identical claims to those Morano made in “Climate Truth File 2016,”whichCFACTreleased in October 2016.

The Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT) released a report titled“Climate Truth File 2016” (PDF)written by Marc Morano, which claims that “The scientific reality is that on virtually every claim — from A to Z — the promoters of manmade climate fears are falling short or going in the opposite direction.”118“Climate Truth File 2016” (PDF), CFACT, October 4, 2016. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.The document appears to be an update toCFACT‘s previously published“Climate Truth File: 2014” (PDF), which begins with a nearly identical introductory statement. Below are the document’s summarized claims:119“CFACT Climate Truth File: 2014” (PDF), October 6, 2014. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
The document celebrates the success of climate change deniers in blocking bills in congress: “ and every time a climate bill has come before theU.S.Congress it has failed to pass. There never was any real climate debate!” it reads. It also denounces theUNParis climate agreement, claiming “so-called ‘solutions’ to global warming are purely symbolic when it comes to climate.”
Morano also makes the often-repeated argument that climate change measures will harm the poor: “ Attempting to control weather and climate will have no impact on climate, but a huge impact on economic development of poor nations due to so-called ‘solutions’ of global warming that would limit development and ban many forms of life-saving carbon based energy.”
According to the report, “The reality is that politicians who say government ‘can do something about droughts, floods, sea levels, hurricanes, and tornadoes are practicing the equivalent of medieval witchcraft.”

The Cornwall Alliance’s founder,Calvin Beisner, has been described as “the most influential evangelical anti-environmentalist in the United States.” Calvin Beisner and the Cornwall Alliancebelieve that “Earth and its ecosystems – created by God’s intelligent design and infinite power and sustained by His faithful providence – are robust, resilient, self-regulating, and self-correcting, admirably suited for human flourishing, and displaying His glory.

1. Humans are “producers and stewards” of the environment, and should not be viewed as “consumers and polluters” because “the application of human and material capital are integral to environmental improvement.”
2. It is “human stewardship that unlocks the potential in creation for all the earth’s inhabitants as good.”
3. Some environmental concerns are “without foundation or greatly exaggerated.” Examples of unfounded concerns “include fears of destructive manmade global warming, overpopulation, and rampant species loss.”

Council for a Competitive EconomyUnited States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1981-1982
According toThe Reason Foundation‘sannual report, the Council for a Competitive Economy held a conference where the authors and editor of the Reason bookInstead of Regulationattended. The book was edited by Robert Poole, with contributors George Benston, Alan Reynolds, and Ida Walters. The Reason Foundation described the book as providing “workable alternatives to 10 major federal regulatory agencies.”36“The Reason Foundation Annual Report, Fiscal Year 1981/1982,”The Reason Foundation.

1979
Apublication of the Competitive Economy Foundation, on file atThe Heartland Institute, reports that Charles Koch—listed as “chairman of Koch Industries and the Council” sent a widely disseminated letter on the “many ways business currently obtains aid from government and then asks, ‘What’s going on here? Have America’s business leaders gone mad? Why are they cutting their own throats-by voluntarily and systematically delivering themselves and their companies into the hands of government regulators?’”37“Using Government Power: Business Against Free Enterprise” (PDF),Competitive Economy Foundation.Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.

The Christian Science Monitorreportedthe Council for a Competitive Economy was initially formed by a group of 50 businessmen and led by Richard W. Wilcke:38David R. Francis. “Some free enterprisers who insist on no subsidies,”Christian Science Monitor, September 26, 1980. Archived June 17, 2019. Archive.fo URL:https://archive.fo/JtyS4
The group would aim for a “less-regulated, freer business environment, with a shrunken role for the government.” Its methods would include lobbying in Congress and testimony at congressional hearings.
For example, in testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Wilcke called for drastic tax cuts to “let taxpayers keep their money to spend, save, or invest as they please,”CSMreported.
“Anything which interferes with this process is a cost to consumers. Laissez faire capitalism ought to be more popular with consumers.” Wilcke said.",,,"The Council for a Competitive Economy (CCE) was a group founded by Charles Kochin May 1979and made up of approximately 2,000 business leaders whopledged to lobbyCongress to end corporate subsidies.1David R.

Mother Jonesdescribed the group as a “short-lived outfit focused on dissuading the business community from accepting government subsidies, bailouts, and other perks. These forms of corporate welfare, Charles believed, were making free-market advocates look hypocritical. ‘How discrediting it is for us to request welfare for ourselves while attacking welfare for the poor,’ he wrote in one appeal to the business community. ‘Our critics rightfully complain that we want socialism only for the rich.’”3Daniel Schulman, Tasneem Raja, and Julia Lurie. “The Koch 130,”Mother Jones, November 3, 2014.Archived June 17, 2019.

The company is owned, as of March 2016, partly by Australian engineering firmAJLucas (45 percent), Anglo-American equity firm RiverstoneLLC(45 percent) and the remaining 10 percent is owned by Cuadrilla management.
Cuadrilla is perhaps best known for its operations in Lancashire, where it first attempted to drill for shale oil and gas in 2011, which caused two minor earthquakes in April of that year. The earthquakes triggered a national moratorium on fracking until 2012.
In December 2012, the former Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) announced it was lifting the ban on hydraulic fracturing in theUKto allow shale gas exploration once again. Since then, the government has been working hard topromote frackingas a way to contribute to the country’s energy security. This has been met with vocal campaigns that stress the harmful impacts of fracking on water resources, health and the climate.1Frances Rankin. “‘Cuadrilla Were in My School Today’ — Fracking Company’s New PR Trick,”DeSmog,July 20, 2017.

One example, according toBloomberg, wasJuly 2014 testimony by Glassman that “meshed perfectly” with the talking points of an affiliate of DCI group he was working for at the time. In his testimony, Glassman argued that Argentina was trying to renege on its debt, and also accused Puerto Rico of the same thing. Glassman never mentioned that he was working for an affiliate of DCI group whose clients at the time included a $25 billion hedge fund that had a dispute with Argentina, and another that was suing Puerto Rico.15Zachary Mider and Ben Elgin. “How Hedge Funds (Secretly) Get Their Way in Washington,”Bloomberg, January 25, 2018.Archived January 28, 2018.

It was a pattern of campaigns where DCI group worked with large hedge funds by crafting what appeared as grass-roots support.

It has blocked efforts to pass a Climate Change Act in Northern Ireland, as well as having a history of supporting creationism and blocking legislation on abortion and gay marriage. It is the only political party in Ireland to support Brexit.
Through its former environment ministerSammy Wilson, theDUPhasstrong links to a networkof individuals and organisations pushing climate disinformation and in favour of a “hard” Brexit.

It believes Northern Ireland should remain part of the United Kingdom and currently has eightMPs sitting in theUKparliament in Westminster.
TheDUP, which campaigned to leave theEU, came under scrutiny following the Brexit referendum after it emerged that the party had received a £435,000 donation from a shadowy group called the Constitutional Research Council — the biggest donation in Northern Ireland’s political history.  The source of this donation remains secret.

In 2023, Dentsu calculated its “advertised emissions”, purportedly becoming the first agency in the industry to do so. Dentsu estimated that its total advertised emissions for 2022 were 12.8 million tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e), 32 times the size of its operational footprint. They reported that 77 percent of these emissions were derived from four client sectors, though they did not disclose which four sectors. Dentsu recognized that if the regulatory landscape were to change and Dentsu became accountable for a portion of these emissions, the financial cost to Dentsu could be “extremely high.”213“Dentsu TCFD Report 2023,”Dentsu, 2023.

Between 2002 and 2013, Donors Capital Fund (DCF) distributed some $170 million to conservative causes, many of which deny the science and impacts of human-caused climate change or the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Much ofDCF’s income comes from unknown private entities with some $347 million of untraceable and unknown income since 2005.
DCFcreates accounts known as “donor-advised funds” for conservative philanthropists and groups and then distributes that money to projects that match their ideologies on their behalf.This arrangement has the effect of concealing the identity of the original donor and also distances donors from specific projects or groups.
DCFis related to its sister organizationDonors Trust(DT). Funders looking to set up accounts of $1 million or more are directed byDTtoDCF. Donations to both organizations are tax deductible.

Suggestions in the memo included creating “dummy businesses” that would buy anti-wind billboards, and creating a “counter-intelligence branch” to track the wind energy industry. It also suggested spending $750,000 on an organization with paid staff and tax-exempt status that would build opposition to state and federal policies promoting wind power.109“Conservative plans to oppose wind power – memo,”The Guardian.

Sallie BaliunasandWillie Soonwrote ahighly controversial papertitled “Proxy climatic and environmental changes of the past 1000 years” that was initially published in the journalClimate Research. The paper, which was partially funded by theAmerican Petroleum Institute, argued that recent climate change is not unique, and that it has changed in the past due to natural causes.
AFOIA request made by Greenpeacerevealed that the API gave Soon and Baliunasa total of $118,443 for the study, over the years 2002 and 2003, in grants titled “Sun’s impact on climate over the last 1000 years” and “1000 years of solar variability.”28“Dr. Willie Soon: A Career Fueled by Big oil and Coal,”Greenpeace USA.Archived January 12, 2015.

After thirteen of the authors that Baliunas and Soon cited in their paper refuted the conclusion of the paper, several editors of Climate Research resigned in protest of the paper’s publication. “They submitted a flawed paper,” said Hans von Storch, editor-in-chief of Climate Research. He said that the journal’s peer review procedure failed to identify methodological flaws in the study.29Jeff Nesmith. “Three Journal Editors Resign OverPaper by Skeptics,”Cox News Service, July 29, 2003.

Energy In Depth, and its affiliated website Energy In Depth Health & Safety,provided a selective interpretationof a health study on fracking suggesting that the “New Report Shows No Link Between Fracking And Health Problems.”41William Allison. “New Report Shows No Link Between Fracking And Health Problems” (PDF),Energy In Depth Health & Safety, September 17, 2019. Archived September 23, 2019. Archive.fo URL:https://archive.fo/06cKu
Theoriginal report, which was an examination of available literature on the health effects of fracking and related activities by the Health Effects Institute affiliate HEI Energy, suggested that due to the recent emergence of fracking there needs to be more studies to fully understand the health effects. EID’s interpretation capitalizes on this as a supposed lack of clear evidence, and suggests the report is evidence of “no direct association between fracking and illnesses.”42“POTENTIAL HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNCONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGY LITERATURE” (PDF),HEI-Energy Research Comittee,September 2019. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
Contrary to this EID claim, the original study suggests that a lack of data in many cases was the issue, and the takeaway point is that more studies need to be done to fully assess the health impacts:
Among the reasons cited for the limitations on prior studies was the secrecy of the fracking industry itself, with some chemicals used in the fracking process remaining unidentified.
It is also worth noting that thesponsors of HEI-Energy, the group that conducted the study, is almost entirely comprised of major oil and gas companies:43“Sponsors,”HEI Energy. Archived September 23, 2019. Archive.fo URL:https://archive.fo/RnK6N

In 2011, MediaCom partnered withWiredmagazine andDiscovery Channelto produce “Earth 2050: The Future of Energy,” a television special for Shell.92“Shell Oil Company | Earth 2050: The Future of Energy,”The One Club.Archived August 20, 2023.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/srnYEThe segment, directed by Michael Epstein, Lilibet Foster, and Nathaniel Kahn, showcases “the energy challenges our world [will face] over the next 40 years” as a result of impending global population growth, according to a press release fromWiredmagazine. The press release states:
“By the year 2050, the world’s population will reach nine billion. The demand on the world’s resources – energy, first and foremost – will be severe. But the road from now to then doesn’t need be bleak. There is a path to a future filled with opportunities, with amazing individuals and extraordinary projects leading the way.”93“Presenting ‘Energy 2050,’”Wired.Archived August 21, 2023.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/g6AEE.
The “Earth 2050” special showcased the benefits of Shell products, including Shell/Raízen ethanol, and spotlighted technological innovations that could reduce CO2emissions, like digital mapping and self-driving cars to make commuting more efficient and improve fuel economy. It also presented Masdar City, thefailed zero-carbon cityin the UAE desert, as a renewable energy-powered urban utopia.94Suzanne Goldenberg. “Masdar’s zero-carbon dream could become world’s first green ghost town,”The Guardian,February 16, 2016But despite showcasing Masdar as a fossil-free ideal, the segment emphasized that a world without fossil fuels is just that, an ideal, repeatedly underscoring the necessity and reliability of fossil fuels. Referencing the solar technologies at Masdar, the documentary noted:
“There’s just one problem: neither of these solar technologies work at night. So, Masdar needs to draw power from the grid when the sun goes down. And that power comes from natural gas. The reality is, it’s just not yet possible to power Masdar entirely without fossil fuels” (at the 36:16 – 39:40 minute mark)
Despite touting its commitments to researching and developing “cleaner fuels” in Earth 2050, Shell’s investment in renewables to date has been negligible. According to GlobalWitness, just 1.5 percent of Shell’s capital expenditure has gone to renewables, with the vast majority of the division’s resources devoted to gas.95Oliver Milman. “Shell’s actual spending on renewables is fraction of what it claims, group alleges,”The Guardian,February 1, 2023.Archived August 21, 2023.Archive URL:https://archive.ph/UfsXq

The Interceptmentioned the conference in a 2018 article, noting it was billed as “Contra-COP23.” “Given that this is Europe, it’s not a huge crowd,” Kate Aronoff reported. Describing Richard Muller’s presentation, she wrote “Müller’s own scientific rationale may make no sense, but his conclusion is easy on the conscience: Relax, everything will be OK. Another version of that message is being marketed across COP23.”32“Denialism b y a Different Name,”The Intercept, April 17, 2018.Archived May 7, 2018. Archive.is URL:https://archive.li/bqOwR
According to Aronoff, who spoke with conference attendees and organizers, they were “remarkably self-aware about their lack of influence.”  Muller, EIKE“s general secretary, said that the first year they held the conference Greenpeace showed up to protest. “Now they don’t come, which is kind of disappointing because we would like the press attention,” Muller said. He also noted that the media in Germany had largely ignored their point of view.  “They act as if we don’t exist,” he said.33“Denialism b y a Different Name,”The Intercept, April 17, 2018.Archived May 7, 2018.

Energy Examined podcast host Tonya Zelinsky asked Smith [00:05:38]:
“I don’t want to harp on this issue when it comes to the Coastal GasLink, but it’s fair to say that LNG Canada needs the Coastal GasLink if it if it wants to move forward. So can you tell me how how the Haisla Nation will be affected if this pipeline is delayed even further or even just cancelled as a result of the public protests and blockades?”
Smith responded [00:06:01]:
“Well, for one, I do not believe that it’s going to be cancelled. But what it would mean if that were to happen would be a loss of opportunity. I mean, it would essentially go back to–so right now, within our Haisla territory are existing a few industrial partnerships, agreements. Honestly, it honestly makes me so emotional–”
Tonya: [00:06:38] Please take a moment.
Crystal [00:06:44] Our nation has worked so hard for this project to be successful because of the opportunities that it meant for our people, and as we were going through this work with LNG Canada, and they had announced their delay of 2015 or 16, they announced they were going to be delaying their F.I.D. It it was emotional then. And when we got to the F.I.D., it was such a joyous time in our community for people to realize that our lives were going to be different. […]”

Messages released as part of aFreedom of Information requestoutlined the First Nations LNG Alliance’s involvement in a Joint Engagement Report with the British Columbia provincial government. In an email co-signed by the First Nations LNG Alliance, First Nations Limited Partnership, and BC LNG Alliance, the groups requested a “joint meeting” with Michelle Mungall, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, and Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Reconciliation.67“FOI Request – IRR-2018-84639,”British Columbia. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
“The LNG Industry in BC is working towards a sustainable and environmentally and socially responsible LNG industry that will benefit British Columbians by adding value to BC’s natural gas,” stated the letter. “Liquefying natural gas creates skilled jobs and business opportunities in BC communities and the additional tax revenues from the industry will help the province invest in programs and services that increase the quality of life for all British Columbians.”
The report highlighted three LNG facility projects that “will contribute nearly $3 billion of new revenue to BC’s government annually.”
The letter notes that the LNG Alliance’s members include LNG Canada – a consortium of Shell and partner companies– WCC LNG (ExxonMobil), Kitimat LNG (Chevron Canada and Woodside Energy), Tilbury LNG (FortisC), Woodfibre LNG, Grassy Point LNG (Woodside Energy), and AltaGAs.68“FOI Request – IRR-2018-84639,”British Columbia.

According to the report’s executive summary, “discussions with local First Nations in each of thefive regional engagement sessions have shown that a high degree of support for LNG projects in British Columbia remains.

Writing for the “full comment” section of theNational Post,the Fraser Institute’s Kenneth Green suggests that while Canada will likely miss its Copenhagen emissions targets set in 2009, this might not necessarily be a significant problem. According to Green, “this is less about Canada being an environmental laggard, and more a problem with agreeing to politically derived targets you have no idea how to hit.”56Kenneth P. Green. “Kenneth P. Green: Canada is prosperous… and relatively green,”National Post, April 23, 2015. Archive URL:https://archive.vn/wip/P6Owz
He goes on to highlight the “good news” in that GDP increase has increased by 71%, making for a “great trend in emissions intensity.” By “letting markets do what they do best,” as opposed to focusing on emissions standards, Green says that emissions will decline on their own due to technological growth.

According to Green, the IPCC process is “corrupted,” and that mainstream climate scientists have become “activists.” Green comments that since 1979, global temperatures have “no significant trend” and there has been a “pause” in the temperature record. He continues to state arguments commonly used by skeptics including that “the climate has always changed,” that “the [temperature] models, themselves, are wrong.”
Green says that he is not a “denier” of the science behind climate change, and that “we are probably causing a mild warming,” however not enough to cause concern.

In aninterview with theWashington Times, Schnare denied all allegations of his mismanagement of FMELC—including extortion, lying to the IRS, harassment and other claims.
The Times recorded audio of a January 27 meeting between Matthew Hardin, the newly elected chairman of the board, and Schnare. In the recording, a man purported to be Schnare asked Hardin if he wanted a “s—t storm,” a statement interpreted by FMELC as a threat.25Ben Wolfgang. “Free Market Environmental Law Clinic’s effort to roll back regulations splinters amid feuding,”The Washington Times, May 9, 2018.Archived May 10, 2018.

The Free Market Environmental Clinic filed a complaint againstDavid Schnare, the group’s chair, after he spent time working in a senior EPA position.  FME Law contended Schnare had improperly obtained the group’s tax-exempt status by misrepresenting its structure.The Daily Beastreported the troubles began when Schnare took a leave of absence from the group in January 2017 and installed fellow attorney Chaim Mandelbaum as FME Law’s executive director.27“Ex-EPA Official’s Legal Advocacy Outfit Embroiled in Vicious Leadership Struggle,”The Daily Beast, April 24, 2018.Archived April 27, 2018.

Schnare told colleagues he expected to spend three or four years working with the EPA. He withdrew from day-to-date operations.28“Ex-EPA Official’s Legal Advocacy Outfit Embroiled in Vicious Leadership Struggle,”The Daily Beast, April 24, 2018.Archived April 27, 2018. Archive.is URL:https://archive.li/N4uYX
In late 2017, a new board with incoming chairman Matthew Hardin asked to review the group’s finances. Mandelbaum initially proved a bullet list of assets and liabilities, but resisted providing more information29“Ex-EPA Official’s Legal Advocacy Outfit Embroiled in Vicious Leadership Struggle,”The Daily Beast, April 24, 2018.Archived April 27, 2018. Archive.is URL:https://archive.li/N4uYX
Schnare admitted the reason for resistance in an email: “It appears I made some significant errors when preparing the by-laws and related papers for FME Law.”30“Ex-EPA Official’s Legal Advocacy Outfit Embroiled in Vicious Leadership Struggle,”The Daily Beast, April 24, 2018.Archived April 27, 2018. Archive.is URL:https://archive.li/N4uYX
One of those errors resulted in FME Law becoming legally paralyzed. When the outside law firm Gross  & Romanick was consulted to sort out the issue, they concluded that “As currently organized, FME cannot act.”31“Ex-EPA Official’s Legal Advocacy Outfit Embroiled in Vicious Leadership Struggle,”The Daily Beast, April 24, 2018.Archived April 27, 2018. Archive.is URL:https://archive.li/N4uYX
“The board of directors is not properly constituted to manage a [professional limited liability corporation]” they concluded in a January 2018 memo. Schnare claimed that conclusion was based on incomplete documentation.32“Ex-EPA Official’s Legal Advocacy Outfit Embroiled in Vicious Leadership Struggle,”The Daily Beast, April 24, 2018.Archived April 27, 2018. Archive.is URL:https://archive.li/N4uYX
The outside law firm also concluded that Schnare had made misstatements in the group’s application for 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, which would make it more difficult to resolve the issues in corporate structure. If a court-appointed receiver were brought on to address the issues, they would be legally required to report the issues to the IRS. Schnare claimed he had already informed the IRS of the underlying issues.33“Ex-EPA Official’s Legal Advocacy Outfit Embroiled in Vicious Leadership Struggle,”The Daily Beast, April 24, 2018.Archived April 27, 2018. Archive.is URL:https://archive.li/N4uYX
“If the IRS were to investigate and rule that tax exempt status was improperly obtained, FME would likely be forced to disgorge any monies raised and any contributors would have to amend their personal tax returns to reflect donations to a nonexempt entity,” Gross  & Romanick had warned. “In such a scenario, it is likely that the members of the board would have some exposure for misrepresenting the status of the organization.”34“Ex-EPA Official’s Legal Advocacy Outfit Embroiled in Vicious Leadership Struggle,”The Daily Beast, April 24, 2018.Archived April 27, 2018. Archive.is URL:https://archive.li/N4uYX
A legal complaint by FME Law alleged that Schnare began requesting “a payout” in the range of $280,000 to “keep things quiet” around the legal issues created in the initial 2011 tax filing. Schnare claimed that the money was to fulfill contractual obligations, and was not hush money.35“Ex-EPA Official’s Legal Advocacy Outfit Embroiled in Vicious Leadership Struggle,”The Daily Beast, April 24, 2018.Archived April 27, 2018.

Founding attorneys David B. Rivkin Jr. and Andrew M. Grossman published an article inTheWall Street Journaltitled “Punishing Climate-Change Skeptics” where they claim there is a “Climate Inquisition” against global warming skeptics, and define this as the reason for establishing their Free Speech in Science Project.34David B. Rivkin Jr. and Andrew M. Grossman. “Punishing Climate-Change Skeptics,”The Wall Street Journal, March 23, 2016. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/Ib3oR
According to Rivkin and Grossman, the “Inquisition” began with a 2012 defamation lawsuit filed by Michael Mann against the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), the latter which the two lawyers represented. They also point to the formal request by Reps. Ted Lieu (D., Calif.) and Mark DeSaulniers (D., Calif.) for the Justice Department to launch an investigation of ExxonMobil’s funding of climate research and policy organizations.35David B. Rivkin Jr. and Andrew M. Grossman. “Punishing Climate-Change Skeptics,”The Wall Street Journal, March 23, 2016. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/Ib3oR
Rivkin and Grossman argue that “Intimidation is the point of these efforts” and that “Individual scientists, think tanks and private businesses are no match for the vast powers that government officials determined to stifle dissent are able to wield. An onslaught of investigations—with the risk of lawsuits, prosecution and punishment—is more than most can afford to bear.”36David B. Rivkin Jr. and Andrew M. Grossman. “Punishing Climate-Change Skeptics,”The Wall Street Journal, March 23, 2016. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/Ib3oR
The two lawyers say that someone needs to “[take] on the Climate Inquisition directly,” which is where their Free Speech in Science Project comes in to defend “scientists” and “policy organizations” with a focus on First Amendment rights.37David B.

The billboard features messaging “Climate Change Is Influenced the Most By You… Or the Sun?” In the wake of their controversial billboard campaign in 2014, the message is comparatively subdued. Friends of Science faced claims that their billboards were “misleading and not based on valid scientific evidence.”104“New Friends of Science Climate Change Billboards Welcome Montreal Grand Prix Revellers,” PRWEB (Press Release) June 5, 2015.

“Our campaign is working. Before and during the election, Friends bought radio advertising in 5 major Ontario markets.

“The response was intense. Some radio stations faced pro-Kyoto interest groups who actually demanded that our ads be pulled! We received a great deal of hostile mail from activists stunned that we would challenge the pro-Kyoto status quo. At the same time though, positive mail poured in, and hits to our website soared into the stratosphere.

The New York Times, in an article based on interviews with formerFTIemployees, internalFTIdocuments, and website registration information, found thatFTIconsulting had been involved in the operations of “at least 15 current and past influence campaigns promoting fossil-fuel interests in addition to its direct work for oil and gas clients.”43Hiroko Tabuchi. “How One Firm Drove Influence Campaigns Nationwide for Big Oil,”The New York Times, November 11, 2020.Archived November 13, 2020.

Hiroko Tabuchi wrote in theNew York Timesarticle thatExxonMobilmay have had a larger role than previously advertised inFTI‘s Energy In Depth campaign:44Hiroko Tabuchi. “How One Firm Drove Influence Campaigns Nationwide for Big Oil,”The New York Times, November 11, 2020.Archived November 13, 2020. Archive URL:https://archive.vn/yQCpL
While on the surface,FTI‘s campaigns appeared to “amplify local voices or speak up for regular people,” on closer investigation, groups “were part of a network of corporate influence campaigns designed, staffed and at times run byFTIConsulting, which had been hired by some of the largest oil and gas companies in the world to help them promote fossil fuels.”
These included a 2018 push byFTI‘s project, the Main Street Investors Coalition warning “that climate activism doesn’t help mom-and-pop investors in the stock market” and campaigns by Texans for Natural Gas and the Arctic Energy Center in 2017 to support fracking and advocate for on-shore and offshore drilling in Alaska.
A spokesman forFTIclaimed the group had always been transparent, commenting: “We hide behind no one.” An Exxon spokesman would not comment, claiming the New York Times reporter was biased against the fossil fuel industry.
Texans for Natural Gas describes itself as a local organization representing “citizens and officeholders, business owners and students” and is funded by oil and gas companies including Exxon subsidiaryXTOEnergy. Elizabeth Caldwell, listed as a “a spokeswoman for the grass-roots organization,” is also a director atFTI.
Other campaignsFTIwas behind included:45Hiroko Tabuchi. “How One Firm Drove Influence Campaigns Nationwide for Big Oil,”The New York Times, November 11, 2020.Archived November 13, 2020. Archive URL:https://archive.vn/yQCpL
Tabuchi also uncovered how anFTIgroup called StratCom, short for Strategic Communications, had tracked the activities of environmental protesters on behalf of Apache Energy, who was seeking to drill near Balmorhea State Park in Texas.
As part of those efforts,FTIalso created a fake Facebook profile in the name of “Susan McDonald” to keep track of protestors. The account “was also intended to helpFTIkeep tabs on activists, formerFTIemployees said.” While its friends list included one current and one formerFTIemployee.
Former StratCom employees also said the group had used strategies to influence public discourse. For example, an internal document dated November 20, 2015 laid out possible roles for communicators such as “The “Semantic Nitpicker,” as the document explained, who “asks an endless series of questions.” The “Dog Typing on a Keyboard” uses “very poor grammar, spelling and punctuation and posts frequently to clutter up the thread and make it hard to read.”
Other strategies they employed included purchasing targeted social media ads leading to the since-shut-down Arctic Energy Center website that promoted drilling in Alaskan waters and in the Arctic National Wildlife refuge. Exxon was reportedly a backer of the Center. A 2016FTIpresentation included a draft budget showing Exxon scheduled to contribute $120,000 over six months on social media platforms.
The New York Timesalso detailedFTI‘s involvement in Main Street Investors, a group claiming to represent small investors and created by industry groups including theNational Association of Manufacturers (NAM).
FTIworked withNAMon a study, written by employees ofFTI‘s wholly owned subsidiary Compass Lexecon, that argued against environmental shareholder resolutions.
FTIalso worked with theIndependent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA)to form DivestmentFacts.com, a website fighting against divestment from fossil fuels. Several papers published on the website were written by professors who also worked for Compass Lexecon.

Dempsey and Michael Sandoval reportedly called Marco Simons, general counsel for EarthRights International, who was representing Colorado communities in a lawsuit seeking damages from Exxon.

In the call, recorded and released by EarthRights, Sandoval confirmed thatWestern Wireis run byFTIConsulting staff and run byFTIunder a contract. According toClimate Liability News, “the two men pressed for an interview even though Simons quickly said he couldn’t talk to them if they represented Exxon in any way.

FUSF released a new video titled “The Dirty Secrets of Electric Cars.” DeSmog’sBen Jervey reportedthat the video could signal “a possible strategic pivot from straightforward fossil fuel cheerleading to electric vehicle (EV) and clean energy bashing.”22“Dirty Secrets of Electric Cars”, YouTube video submitted by user Fueling U.S. Forward, July 11, 2017. Archived .mp4 on file at DeSmog.23Ben Jervey. “Koch-funded Group, Fueling US Forward, Echoes America Rising Squared in Misleading Attack on Electric Cars,”DeSmog, July 10, 2017.
Jervey also notes the connection between the Fueling U.S. Forward Campaign and that ofAmerica Rising Squared (AR2), which has also been launching an attack on electric vehicles. While the two groups maintain no public connection, they both launched nearly identical arguments with similar language within weeks of each other in June, 2017. AR2 had published a white paper that claimed to reveal human and environmental costs of ‘clean energy,’” pointing to rare earth metals.DeSmog also reported on the AR2 white paperat the time.24Ben Jervey. “America Rising Squared Report Bashes EVs for Using Same Rare Earth Metals as Gas-Powered Cars,”DeSmog, June 25, 2017.

The video, which runs just over a minute-and-a-half, is debunked line-by-line below:25Ben Jervey. “Koch-funded Group, Fueling US Forward, Echoes America Rising Squared in Misleading Attack on Electric Cars,”DeSmog, July 10, 2017.
This depends on an exceedingly narrow definition of “toxic.” If you only consider the materials that go into the batteries of electric cars versus the batteries of “average” cars, then this is maybe defensible. But if you consider the materials that go into the entire vehicle, as well as the fuel used to power the vehicle, than EVs are far cleaner and less toxic.27Ben Jervey. “Koch-funded Group, Fueling US Forward, Echoes America Rising Squared in Misleading Attack on Electric Cars,”DeSmog, July 10, 2017.
First, there’s the fact that gas-powered vehicles require some of the same “toxic” rare earth metals that the video criticizes. (More on that below.) Then there’s the even bigger issue that tailpipe emissions — including ozone, particulate matter, and other smog-forming chemicals — are the dominant source of ground level air pollution, and nearly one half of all Americans live in areas thatdon’t meet federal minimum air quality standards. In fact, emissions from road transportation cause roughly 53,000 premature deaths every year in the United States,according to MIT researchers.28“Study: Air pollution causes 200,000 early deaths each year in the U.S.”MIT News, August 29, 2013.Archived July 12, 2017. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/gQ6qd
First, a fact check: cobalt and lithium aren’t rare earth metals. This isn’t to say they aren’t problematic — cobalt mining in particular is plagued by some very serious environmental and labor problems, as documented in in-depthreports by Amnesty International29“Electric cars: Running on child labour?”Amnesty International, September 30, 2016.Archived July 12, 2017. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/DNEFtandthe Washington Post. But these problems are economy-wide. Cobalt is used widely in the lithium-ion batteries that power most cell phones and laptops. (See the subheadline of thevery Washington Post article that the FUSF video cites: “Tracing the path from deadly hand-dug mines in Congo to consumers’ phones and laptops”.) There’s no question that lithium-ion battery manufacturers have to clean up their supply chains, but that’s something that Apple and Panasonic and Samsung are as responsible for as Tesla and Ford and General Motors.30Todd C. Frankel. “THE COBALT PIPELINE,”The Washington Post, September 30, 2016.Archived July 12, 2017. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/2zBTD
True, cerium is used in the batteries of electric vehicles. It is also found on every catalytic converter fitted into an internal combustion vehicle. That’s right — every gas-powered car relies on this rare earth metal that Fueling U.S. Forward criticizes.31Ben Jervey. “Koch-funded Group, Fueling US Forward, Echoes America Rising Squared in Misleading Attack on Electric Cars,”DeSmog, July 10, 2017.
Again, electric vehicle manufacturers must do their part to clean up the mining of these metals. But so do the cell phone and laptop makers, companies that supply communications and combat equipment to the Department of Defense, satellite communications system operators, medical device manufacturers, and so on.32Ben Jervey. “Koch-funded Group, Fueling US Forward, Echoes America Rising Squared in Misleading Attack on Electric Cars,”DeSmog, July 10, 2017.
This last point is simply untrue. First of all, very few electric vehicle batteries have even run through their usable lives. Once they do,companies are already lining up to start recycling them,33John O’Dell. “What Happens to EV and Hybrid Batteries?”Edmunds, July 25, 2014.

Some of the components of electric car batteries have localized health and environmental impacts. But compared to the alternative — internal combustion vehicles spewing carbon and other air pollution — electric cars truly are much cleaner from cradle to grave.36Ben Jervey. “Koch-funded Group, Fueling US Forward, Echoes America Rising Squared in Misleading Attack on Electric Cars,”DeSmog, July 10, 2017.

Lindzen’s paper argued that “CO2 is a particularly ridiculous choice for a ‘pollutant’”, that “it’s primary role is as a fertilizer for plant life” and that “unless we wake up to the absurdity of the motivating narrative, this is likely only to be the beginning of the disasters that will follow from the current irrational demonization of CO2”.
Decarbonisation, according to Lindzen’s paper, is “largely irrelevant to climate change, while imposing great and pointless pain”.
After summing up what he interprets as multiple misunderstandings around the greenhouse effect, Lindzen claimed: “this all leaves us with a quasi-religious movement predicated on an absurd ‘scientific’ narrative”.

In response, a spokesperson for the GWPF said: “We do not accept donations from anyone with an interest in an energy company. We turn down many offers of funding from people with vested interests. I am not sure this is true of any group on the other side of the debate.
“Donor’s Trust [sic] is a middleman, matching donors to those seeking funding. Disbursements are not made from a homogenous pool of money – recipients of funds know the identity of the original donors. We are therefore able to vet them in line with our funding policy.
“I suggest you also consider what constitutes an ‘interest’. Money that is inherited does not create an ‘interest’, let alone a vested one. The wealth that ultimately created the Scaife Foundation was created at the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th. It would be ludicrous to suggest that three generations on, it represents an oil company interest.”

According to Lane, “The shale gas boom, if government policy allows it to proceed, offers vast benefits. The economic gains are patent. Large benefits in national and global security are also in the offing. And the boom will also help to dampen growth in global warming emissions.”
The study concludes, “In sum, developing U.S. natural gas resources will yield gains in economics, national security, and the environment. […] The FRAC Act would impose a new set of federal standards on state regulators. The above analysis implies that this step would not enhance the efficient division of labor between federal and state governments.”

Hudson’s report was titled “The Specter of Species Extinction,” and led by the father-and-sons team ofSherwood,Craig, andKeith Idso. It concluded that “higher CO2 levels act as fertilizer for trees and plants, and that higher CO2 levels also reduce the amount of energy ‘wasted’ by virtually all plant species on a process called photorespiration. As long as temperatures and CO2 are both rising, trees and plants will be vigorous enough to exploit warming’s opportunities to expand their range, rather than getting death notices from Greenpeace.”",,,"The Hudson Institute (HI)was founded in 1961 by strategist Herman Kahn and his colleagues at theRand Corporation.

“As it stands, subsidized renewable power sources forced onto the system have left Texans vulnerable to power outages, a problem that could worsen in the future,” Burnett claimed in the podcast’s description.
Discussing the Texas power outages in 2021, Burnett commented:
“I’m saying we used to have other coal plants, but they were not just off line they had been closed. We had a lot of wind and solar, more wind in Texas than solar, but some solar that suddenly was politically mandated, but was not putting power on the grid. So that’s the day. But what built up to it?”

Describing CAFE, the letter contends: “Those families and individuals who prefer or need trucks, SUVs, and crossovers pay more to subsidize those who buy smaller vehicles or electric vehicles under the existing mandate. This significant, needless, and unjust cost is a very real regressive tax on American families that has made our country worse off.”31CAFE-Coaliton-to-Trump-April-2020-9 (PDF),American Energy Alliance.

Ablog pieceon the Institute’s website rails against Xcel Energy’s Colorado Energy Plan recently approved by the Public Utilities Commission. The plan seeks to replace coal generation with wind and solar,halving carbon emissions and saving ratepayers $215 million. But the blog piece, written by a former coal executive at Xcel, argues that ratepayers will pay more under this plan.
The author claims any customer savings would be “several decades away” and points to coal jobs that would be lost. Contrary to these complaints, the economics are actually favorable to renewable energy. As an Xcel resource planning executivetold Greentech Media, “In many areas, the incremental cost of renewable generation is currently less than the embedded cost of existing generation.” The author of the blog piece, Duane Richards, is a former Director of Coal for Xcel Energy.36Duane Richards. “The Colorado Energy Plan: A proposal that benefits all but the consumer,”Independence Institute, August 30, 2018.Archived September 13, 2018.Archive URL:https://archive.fo/Wev4w

Further down in the op-ed, she floats the idea that the next Colorado governor could, perhaps, issue a call for “100 percent coal.”38Amy Cooke. “Coloradans are taking on the state’s largest monopoly utility,”The Hill, March 7, 2018.Archived September 13, 2018.

According to the contest description: “We want to highlight the work horses of the energy world — fossil fuels…The choice of energy sources and how they are utilized should come from the demands of an innovative and free market with fossil fuels, wind, and solar competing on an even playing field.”39“Earth Day Fossil Fuels Poster Contest,”Independence Institute.Archived September 13, 2018. Archive URL:https://archive.fo/l0khv
Independence Institute fails to mention that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized to the tune of billions of dollars annually, not to mention the external costs of dirty energy in terms of climate and health costs. The hypocrisy of the contest itself and the explanation behind it could not be clearer.

Thisvideo clipfrom “Devil’s Advocate with Jon Caldara” features Caldara discussing Boulder, Colorado’s plan to take legal action against oil and gas companies with Michael Sandoval. Caldara and Sandoval dismiss the climate damage that drives the climate liability lawsuits and trumpet the fossil fuel industry talking point that these suits are solely about lining the pockets of the plaintiff attorneys.
“But when you’re talking about damages I think we should focus on the damages that [plaintiffs’ attorneys] are expecting to get out of it, not the actual climate change damages that they’re claiming,” said Sandoval.40“The Latest Attacks on Oil and Gas,” YouTube video uploaded by user “IITV”, February 27, 2018.

The Independence Institute held an“Earth Day Fossil Fuels Art Contest”for the purpose of showcasing “the awesomeness of fossil fuels.” The blatant promotion of fossil fuels fittingly included a fossil fuel reward as its prize – a $100 gasoline gift card.
“It’s time to include fossil fuels in the Earth Day celebration,” Amy Oliver Cooke, executive vice president and director of the Independence Institute’s Energy Policy Center,told Bloomberg.
As the Bloombergarticlepoints out, Independence Institute has financial ties to fossil fuel interests like Peabody Energy and Koch Industries, and previous donors include entities like Mobil Oil Corp.41Ari Natter. “Earth Day Art Contest Showcases ‘Awesomeness’ of Fossil Fuels,”Bloomberg, April 13, 2017.

Despite their intermittency and their claims that they can compete with traditional technologies, the wind and solar industries want extensions and expansions of existing subsidies to be included in the coronavirus relief bills Congress is enacting.”41“Hospitals Need Reliable Energy to Keep Coronavirus Patients Alive,”Institute for Energy Research, April 2, 2020.

DeSmog‘s Graham Readfearn reported that recent disclosures made to the New South Wales Supreme Court confirmed that Rinehart was a key donor to theInstitute for Public Affairs (IPA). Her company, Hancock Prospecting Proprietary Ltd (HPPL) had donated $2.3 million to theIPAin 2016 and $2.2 million in 2017, according to the disclosures.21Graham Readfearn. “Billionaire Mining Magnate Gina Rinehart Revealed As Key Donor to Australian Climate Science Denial Promoter Institute of Public Affairs,”DeSmog, July 17, 2018.
The documents were revealed as part of a long legal dispute overHPPL‘s use of company funds, brought on by Gina Rinehart’s daughter Bianca.22Graham Readfearn. “Billionaire Mining Magnate Gina Rinehart Revealed As Key Donor to Australian Climate Science Denial Promoter Institute of Public Affairs,”DeSmog, July 17, 2018.
The court judgement reported Bianca’s solicitors had been provided with a schedule of “donations and sponsorships” fromHPPLwhere it was disclosed “thatHPPLpaid or provided amounts toIPAin a total of $2.3 million for the 2016 financial year and $2.2 million in the 2017 financial year.”23Graham Readfearn. “Billionaire Mining Magnate Gina Rinehart Revealed As Key Donor to Australian Climate Science Denial Promoter Institute of Public Affairs,”DeSmog, July 17, 2018.

For example, according to theIPA‘s 2017 annual report, it had received “86 percent” of its total revenue of $6.1 million from individuals. However, the $2.2 million donation fromHPPLthat year would have been more than one-third of theIPA‘s income.

Shortly after President Obama cited Spain’s success at creating green jobs, Republicans brought in Gabriel Calzada, president of Institute Juan de Mariana to present a study that claimed each green job in Spain destroyed 2.2 jobs as a result. The study bore the letterhead of the University of Rey Juan Carlos where Calzada is Associate Professor, but was co-commissioned by the Instituto Juan de Mariana.
According to the study, “the Spanish/EU-style ‘green jobs’ agenda now being promoted in the U.S. in fact destroys jobs. […] The study’s results demonstrate how such ‘green jobs’ policy clearly hinders Spain’s way out of the current economic crisis, even while U.S. politicians insist that rushing  into such a scheme will ease their own emergence from the turmoil.”
Calzada testified before the House Select Committee on Energy Independence, stating that “Europe’s experience actually suggests that this is precisely the wrong approach.” The study that Calzada referenced was debunked by the Spanish Government. Gabriel Calzada alsoappeared on Fox Newsto promote his study.20Josh Harkinson. “Climate Change Deniers Without Borders,”Mother Jones, December 22, 2009. Archived October 24, 2015.

Lewandowski notes that, in February of 2006, “IREAalone contributed $100,000 to Dr. Michaels.” He added, “we contacted all of the G&T’s in the United States and as of the writing of this letter, we have obtained additional contributions and pledges for Dr. Michaels [ibid] group.”19IREA Letter (PDF), July 17, 2006. retrieved from The Public Interest Network.Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.

We cannot allow the discussion to be monopolized by the alarmists,” he said.

In 1963, the JBS claimed that a “detailed study of ‘the life and lies’ of Martin Luther King […] will convince any reasonable American that this man is not working for, but against, the real welfare and best interests of either the Negroes in the United States, or of the United States as a whole.”106Lisa Graves. “How Charles Koch Backed the John Birch Society at the Height of Its Attacks on Martin Luther King,”PR Watch,January 18, 2006.Archived August 5, 2017.

The John Locke Foundation was behind an effort to combat the Center for Climate Strategies, a nonprofit group in Washington trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,the Institute for Southern Studies reports.
One of the Locke Institute’s criticisms is that the Center for Climate Strategies was founded by an “environmental advocacy group.” The Institute for Southern Studies writes that The Pennsylvania Environmental Council is actually “a business-friendly organization […] whose current directors include representatives from leading energy companies like PPL Corp., Inter-Power, Exelon and Reliant.”56Sue Sturgis. “SPECIAL INVESTIGATION: Who’s behind the attack on state climate policy?” The Institute for Southern Studies, November 13, 2007.Archived April 21, 2016.

The Sept. 12 conference call drew state legislators, policy analysts, and a lobbyist for Peabody Energy, the world’s largest coal company. The featured speaker was Michael Sanera, Locke’s research director and a member of an advisory board for the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow as well as a former analyst at the Heritage Foundation — both funded by ExxonMobil.58Sue Sturgis. “SPECIAL INVESTIGATION: Who’s behind the attack on state climate policy?” The Institute for Southern Studies, November 13, 2007.Archived April 21, 2016.

It is estimated that during this time, three million gallons of oil were dumped into lakes and streams in six different states. The Environmental Protection Agency’s lawsuits ranged from $71 million to $214 million. In 2000, the EPA settled the case for $35 million in fines. Also, during the 1990s Koch was fined $8 million for discharging oil into streams in Minnesota.35“Koch’s Low Profile Belies Political Power: Private oil company does both business and politics with the shades drawn,”The Center for Public Integrity, March 31, 2006.

Discussing API’s role:
On Koch, the lawsuit suggests that the company is liable for the various actions of its numerous subsidiaries involved in the manufacturing, refining, and distribution of petroleum products. It also notes:46“State of Minnesota, by its Attorney General, Keith Ellison Vs. American Petroleum Institute et al” (PDF), State of Minnesota County of Ramsey, District Court Second Judicial District. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.”
It also notes that, like numerous other oil companies, “Koch also understood climate-change science, the connection to sales of its fossil fuel products, and the potential for catastrophic consequences before the science was widely understood by the general public.”48“State of Minnesota, by its Attorney General, Keith Ellison Vs. American Petroleum Institute et al” (PDF), State of Minnesota County of Ramsey, District Court Second Judicial District. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.”
It highlights what appeared to be a coordinated effort by companies including Koch to “combat climate change ‘alarmists’ through a campaign focused on science, information dissemination, and politics.” It highlights a2006 memo from the Intermountain Rural Electric Associationthat outlined how Koch Industries was working with other large corporations including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Southern Company, American Electric Power (AEP), and National Association of Manufacturers (NAM).
Shortly after, theD.C. Attorney General’s Officejoined in a similar lawsuit against BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell. The lawsuit alleges the four largest investor-owned oil and gas companies violated the District’s Consumer Protection Procedures Act by promoting and selling fossil fuel products contributing to global warming, while knowing about the harmful consequences since at least the 1950s.49Dana Drugmand. “DC Is the Latest to Sue Exxon and Big Oil for Climate Disinformation Campaigns,”DeSmog, June 25, 2020.
The lawsuit highlights the industry’s use of fake grassroots groups, such as theAdvancement of Sound Science Coalition, which started out as a front group for tobacco giant Philip Morris in 1993. This group had transitioned to become the Advancement of Sound Science Center in 1997 and was run out of the home of climate science denierSteve Milloy, who most recently worked in public relations for coal company Murray Energy, before being disbanded.50Dana Drugmand. “DC Is the Latest to Sue Exxon and Big Oil for Climate Disinformation Campaigns,”DeSmog, June 25, 2020.

Thecompany began inthe 1920s when, according to company lore, recent MIT graduateFred C. Kochdeveloped a better way to convert or “crack” heavy oil into gasoline. As Lisa Gravesnoted:
“[I]n 1925, the 25-year old Koch formed the Winkler-Koch Engineering Company, with Lewis Winkler. After studying at Rice and MIT, the Texan-born Koch joined Winkler and another man in launching the company in Wichita.
“Before that, Winkler had worked as the chief engineer at Universal Oil Products, a firm that held patents on the fuel processing methods developed by Jesse Dubbs. Before joining up with Koch, Winkler had helped Dubbs’ son, Carbon, install one of the first thermal “cracking” stills that used the pressure and heat process that Koch’s firm would later deploy with slight modification, according to the expert testimony of the chairman of MIT’s chemical engineering department, as noted in Dan Schulman’s “Sons of Wichita.” Ultimately, though, after a bribery scandal involving an appellate judge the verdict against the Koch firm would be overturned and Universal Oil Products’ successor firms would pay the company damages.
“But back in 1929 – before the sudden stock market crash and nearly three years before the patent case went to trial  – Koch’s firm signed contracts to build cracking stills in the U.S.S.R.
“The communist regime didn’t recognize intellectual property rights, but it did pay well.”
Jane Mayer, as detailed in her landmark bookDark Money, detailed how Soviet Leader Josef Stalin was not the only foreign strongman Koch profited handsomely from, while most Americans struggled after the stock market crashed and then President Roosevelt sought to wake the economy from the Great Depression. She documented how in the 1930s Koch had built a major airplace fuel refinery for Adolf Hitler as he threated neighboring states with war. That became the biggest refinery fueling the Luftwaffe as it bombed civilians in cities likeGuernica, before the Allies in WWII destroyed it.
Eventually in 1940, Fred Koch founded the Wood River Oil and Refining Company. After Fred Koch’s death in 1967, his son Charles Koch took control of the company. In 1967, Charles renamed the company Koch Industries, Inc. His brother, thelate David H. Koch, joined the company in 1971 and became a vice-president in 1978.4“History Timeline,”Koch Industries.

The Lavoisier Group released a pamphlet on“Australia and the Kyoto Protocol.”Among other claims, the pamphlet declares there had been “virtually no temperature increases in the atmosphere” in 22 years.62“Australia and the Kyoto Protocol” (PDF),The Lavoisier Group,October 2001.
“[N]ot only would a reduction by Australia of carbon dioxide emissions from 567 to 416 million tonnes have no discernible impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations; the world-wide reduction mandated under the Kyoto Protocol would, likewise, have no discernible impact on these concentration,” the document claimed.63“Australia and the Kyoto Protocol” (PDF),The Lavoisier Group,October 2001.
It also suggests that Kyoto would lead to “global governance” and so “Australians who value their sovereignty and traditions of self-government will have no part in such a deal.” In a section on the “Science,” the pamphlet reiterates its claim that temperatures have not been increasing and suggests there is “an ongoing and vigorous debate about global surface temperatures over the last century.”64“Australia and the Kyoto Protocol” (PDF),The Lavoisier Group,October 2001.

The Lavoisier Group made a submission to the Senate References Committee for the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on theRenewable Energy Bill 2000.The bills would introduce a carbon tax system in which CO2 emissions from coal-fired electricity generators would be reduced by a goal of 5.5 million tons.65“Submission to the Senate References Committee for the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts” (PDF),The Lavoisier Group, July 26, 2000.
Lavoisier described the bills as “an example of government folly, particularly bureaucratic folly, which is cause for concern,” saying that the costs of energy would increase significantly for consumers in Australia.66“Submission to the Senate References Committee for the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts” (PDF),The Lavoisier Group, July 26, 2000.

In asubmission to the JSCOT inquiry into the Kyoto Protocol, “The Lavoisier Group argues that with the Kyoto Protocol we face the most serious challenge to our sovereignty since the Japanese Fleet entered the Coral Sea on 3 May, 1942.”67“Submission to the JSCOT Inquiry into The Kyoto Protocol” (PDF), The Lavoisier Group, October 2000.
A section entitled “Kyoto and the Science of Greenhouse” puts forward many common climate change denial talking points. First, it describes CO2 as “plant food”:
It suggests models are unreliable and have been “undermined”: “Each model gives different forecasts, and that in itself is evidence of very great complexity of the physical reality of the earth’s atmosphere and its relationship with the oceans, and above all the sun, from whence all our energy comes. […] Since the early to mid-1990s the credibility of the GCMs in predicting anything about global climate has been undermined to the point where they no longer feature in the debate.”69“Submission to the JSCOT Inquiry into The Kyoto Protocol” (PDF), The Lavoisier Group, October 2000.
The document further claims that the well-established science connecting CO2 increases to global warming “has suffered one reversal after another,” and concludes that global warming and the greenhouse effect “is intellectually discredited, sustained only by massive subventions from governments in Western Europe, North America, and Australia.”70“Submission to the JSCOT Inquiry into The Kyoto Protocol” (PDF), The Lavoisier Group, October 2000.",,,"The Lavoisier Group, borrowing the name of French chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, was founded in March 2000 by the lateRay Evans, then an executive at theWestern Mining Corporation (WMC),Hugh Morgan(past CEO of WMC), andPeter Walsh.

The Lavoisier Group was created after the United Nation’s Kyoto Protocol was signed, and was in response to submissions by the Australian Greenhouse Office intending to implement carbon trading to meet its Koyoto commitments.

“I think if we try to solve climate change with today’s existing technology, we will end up replacing a pretty efficient energy system based on fossil fuels with a somewhat inefficient one based on renewable energy, which uses huge quantities of landscape again.
“You know, it’s back to the medieval idea that you need the landscape. Because you know, wind and sun and so on are very, very dilute. Very non-concentrated forms of energy so you need large areas of land to make energy out of them. And they’re not making much inroads.

Karen Ogen-Toews, CEO of the First Nations LNG Alliance, appeared on anepisode of MLI’sStraight Talkwith MLI senior fellow Ken Coates.
In the episode, Coates asked Ogen-Toews, “How do you deal with the situation now in British Columbia, where particularly people who aren’t from your First Nation and who aren’t even from your region are protesting against the decision of a First Nation community in the north to support the pipeline?”
Karen Ogen-Toews responded:
“I think in a lot of ways these groups have perpetuated the division and the fracturing of our Wet’suwet’en people. […] I don’t have a lot of good things to say about these groups because we are the people that have to live within our communities and work for our communities and these nongovernment organizations are out of the picture now. It was well-funded. They put on a good show but at the end of the day it’s our people that are left having to make a way forward for ourselves.”
Coates commented, “That’s a very evocative way of describing it. I think the country as a whole really needs to understand that that’s the kind of impact these external interventions have on the community.”
Regarding the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, or UNDRIP, Ogen-Toews commented:
“I think that a lot of people use the term UNDRIP very loosely. What does it mean to us? I guess there is a couple of things. A lot of people learned what UNDRIP means and what it means to us. But I think there were a lot of people who jumped on the bandwagon not knowing the full issues on why there was such controversy with UNDRIP. […]”

Joseph Quesnel, identified as MLI’s “program manager of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute’s Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy (ACNRE) project,”wrote an article in theHill Timescalling “Indigenous participation in energy sector an exercise in Indigenous self-determination, economic development.”50Joseph Quesnel. “Indigenous participation in energy sector an exercise in Indigenous self-determination, economic development: Joseph Quesnel in the Hill Times,”MLI, December 3, 2019. Archived May 30, 2022. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/lEAhK
Quesnel highlighted a statement by the pro-resource-development Indian Resource Council, criticizing a climate strike by Climate Justice Edmonton.
“[T]hey might not have expected a stern reminder from a group called the Indian Resource Council. After all, climate activists believe they are the ones who speak for First Nations’ interests,” Quesnel wrote.
“Some environmentalist groups act as ‘fair weather friends’ with Indigenous communities, if the communities oppose what they oppose. But Indigenous people are realists and pragmatists, realizing that in the remote regions they occupy, sometimes the resource sector is the only game in town. So, they work with that reality.”
Quesnel concluded: “Politicians and activists need to understand how hardline positions on resource development will affect their professed commitments to improving Indigenous well-being. When politicians say they want to keep our resources in the ground, and then say in the next breath they want to improve conditions of First Nation communities, someone needs to call them out on the contradiction. That is what many Indigenous people would do, if they were included in this election debate rather than being left on the periphery.”
Quesnel previously worked for more than 10 years with theFrontier Center for Public Policy, “where he specialized in Indigenous policy, but also property rights and water market issues.” He has also been a senior fellow at theFraser Institute.51Joseph Quesnel and Ken Coates.“Breaking the Pipeline Logjam” (PDF),MLI, June 2019.

The Atlas Networked noted that MLI senior fellow Dwight Newman testified before the Senate Standing Committee in 2019 on “unintended consequences” of the legislation:
“Newmann [sic] explained that, although the bill was intended to provide harmony between Indigenous people and the government, it would have led to massive uncertainty in the Canadian legal system since it was an international act that didn’t consider local priorities or the local economy. The bill was ultimately defeated.”

MLI released a report titled “Breaking the Pipeline Logjam.” The document’s co-authors wereJoseph Quesnel, MLI’s “program manager of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute’s Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy (ACNRE) project”53Joseph Quesnel. “Indigenous participation in energy sector an exercise in Indigenous self-determination, economic development: Joseph Quesnel in the Hill Times,”MLI, December 3, 2019.

Archived May 30, 2022. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/xglc0
The study was part of the MLI’s “Mandate for Canada” series “examining key election issues.”
“Canadians are beginning to understand what is at stake with the current pipeline logjam. They need to see how this issue affects more than just workers and economies in the West. Delayed and stalled pipelines affect us all. With this paper we aim to provide some guidance to all federal parties grappling with these issues,” Quesnel and Coateswrote in the study.55Joseph Quesnel and Ken Coates.“Breaking the Pipeline Logjam” (PDF),MLI, June 2019. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
Listed under “Challenges to getting pipelines built,” the study claimed that “foreign-funded environmentalist campaigns” were key in the opposition to pipeline development in Canada, highlighting work on the topic by Canadian bloggerVivian Krause.
The report went on to highlight First Nations groups that have worked closely with MLI’s Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy project, headed by Coates himself:
Coates and Quesnel claimed Indigenous communities generally were in favor of pipelines:
The report went on to outline MLI’s work in opposing certain elements of the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples because of their potential impacts on pipelines:
“Much of the controversy in the Indigenous world surrounds the legality and constitutionality of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), particularly the articles dealing with a “free, prior, and informed consent” for resource development (the so-called FPIC section). The federal government deserves a large portion of the blame for the continuing confusion. When the Trudeau government declared its strong support for UNDRIP, many First Nation leaders and activists began to interpret this to mean that FPIC granted First Nationsa virtual legal veto over projects they did not support. However, legal and constitutional experts – including MLI’s own Dwight Newman – have stated clearly that the duty to consult does not equal a veto or a requirement for full consent or unanimity (Newman 2017).
[…]
The report also criticizedBill-C69, legislation in the House of Commons designed to put a greater focus on the impacts of pipeline projects on Indigenous populations, as well as revising the list of activities that would trigger an impact assessment:
“Bill C-69 has been almost universally opposed by pipeline interests as being unnecessarily obstructionist and adding potential delays,” Coates and Quesnel wrote, going on to say:
They concluded in the report that the federal government “needs to recognize that most Canadians support the oil and gas industry and understand that the delays have created a national crisis.”
Other recommendations included:
“The federal government must delay Bill C-69 for at least three years to allow for improvements tothe legislation and to permit the industry to rebound from current difficulties. The governmentmust also scrap Bill C-48,” proposed legislation regardingregulation of marine oil transportationon the north coast of British Columbia.
“Canadian supporters of the energy sector must make sure that Canadians understand the forces that are influencing national debates and conversations. The federal government needs to take an active role in exposing the foreign-funded groups that are undermining our economic interests. At one extreme, supporters might determine if there are legal means of preventing foreign-funded foundations and environmental organizations from undermining Canada’s pipeline projects, while ensuring that all actions are consistent with Charter protections on freedom of expression. […] On a national scale, the federal government could consider creating a parliamentary inquiry committee to investigate these matters as quickly as possible.”March 1, 2019
Joseph Quesnel, identified as the program manager for the Macdonald-Laurier Institute’s Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy project, wrote anopinion piece for theFinancial Postopposing Bill C-69, in particular regarding additional impact assessments for pipeline projects.56Joseph Quesnel. “Indigenous-Canadians are upset with the Liberal government’s Bill C-69, too,”Financial Post,March 1, 2019. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/LlXB5
“Many industry observers have been spotlighting the growing evidence that foreign-funded environmental foundations are seeking to undermine our economic interests and keep oil and gas in the ground. First Nations and Métis communities are rightfully concerned that this more open standing test in Bill C-69 would allow foreign-funded environmentalists to hold up and prolong assessment hearings,” Quesnel claimed in the op-ed.
“Also, mentioning the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) in the bill’s main preamble may please Indigenous academics and environmental activists, but it adds uncertainty to the process because UNDRIP includes controversial provisions that imply Indigenous communities have a veto over resource projects. This is important because preambles in legislation are used in courts and in interpreting statutes,” Quesnel wrote.
December 2018
MLI’sInside Policymagazine57Inside PolicyDecember 2018 issue. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog. republished an op-ed opposing Bill C-69 by Stephen Buffalo, who represented the pro-resource development Indian Resource Council. The piece had originally run in theFinancial Post.
“Bill C-69 is being rushed through by a government that does not seem to understand its obligations to consult comprehensively with Indigenous peoples,” said Buffalo.
“Far from being uniformly opposed to resource development, many Indigenous nations understand that careful engagement and effective partnerships will provide us with a once-in-a-century opportunity to share in Canada’s prosperity,” he added.
“Our nations reject the permanent poverty that generations of government policies have imposed on us. And while many Indigenous peoples share some of the values and perspective of some members of the environmental movement, we resent the assumption that non-Indigenous environmentalists speak for us. We can speak for ourselves – and we insist on the right to do so.
“The Indian Resource Council, the organization I represent, calls on the government of Canada to pull Bill C-69 from its legislative calendar and to revisit its consultations with Indigenous peoples and organizations.”

“What kind of disruptions should Americans anticipate from climate change? According to the studies that have informed federal policy, the scenario is dire: increased deaths from extreme heat and air pollution, as well as reduced economic productivity. In a groundbreaking new report, however, MI senior fellow Oren Cass argues that the situation is not nearly so grim,” the event description read, adding “the long-term costs of climate change are being consistently overstated while too little energy is being devoted to plans for adaptation.”37“Overheated: How Flawed Analyses Overestimate The Costs Of Climate Change,”Manhattan Institute.

Cassreleased the report on March 11, with an accompanying article inThe Wall Street Journaltitled “Doomsday Climate Scenarios Are a Joke.” In the WSJ article, Cass argued that estimates of the cost of climate change come from “laughably bad economics,” and that adaptation is the answer to climate-change related deaths.38“Overheated: How Flawed Analyses Overestimate the Costs of Climate Change,”Manhattan Institute, March 11, 2018.

One IPG employee told DeSmog there was “growing unease” among employees about the company’s work for Aramco.112“IPG,”DeSmogdatabase profile.
In response to the news that McCann was repitching for Aramco, campaigners launched a spoof agency, ‘Atmospheric,’ whose mission was to give its clients “the social license they need to Keep the Fire Burning™.” Atmospheric posted a satirical billboard ad in central London: “The climate is changing. Business shouldn’t have to.” The climate collective Glimpse, alongside Utopia Bureau, a climate communications lab, and satirist and musician Oli Frost, created Atmospheric. Glimpse’s founder, James Turner, said its spoof campaign: “is completely ridiculous. But it’s nowhere near as absurd as pitching for the world’s most polluting companies while pretending to have a meaningful policy on climate change.”113Ellen Ormesher. “Why a fake agency is pitching for Saudi Aramco’s account,”The Drum, November 23, 2023.Archived March 3, 2025.

The State in Liberal TheoryProf. Boudewijn Bouckaert",,,"The Mont Pelerin Society (MPS) was created in 1947 by the free market economist and philosopher Friedrich von Hayek and advocates “classical liberalism,” an ideology classified by small government and minimal regulation of business. It was named after the location of the group’s first meeting in Switzerland, and the group’s subsequent annual meetings have spanned the globe including Galapagos Islands, Prague (former Czech president Vaclav Klaus is a member), New York, Morocco, Tokyo, Sydney, Buenos Aires, and Stockholm. American economist Milton Friedman wasalso one of the founding membersof the Society.1Eamonn Butler.“A Short History of the Mont Pelerin Society” (PDF),Montpelerin.org.

Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/a9VLc
The 1995 book by the Liberty Fund,A History of the Mont Pelerin Society, describes the group as having “no demonstrably proven role in world affairs.” According to ashort history of the MPS writtenby the group’s Vice President Eamonn Butler, it has “no official views, formulates no policies, publishes no manifestos, aligns itself with no party, and accepts no political or public funding.” Butler adds that it engages primarily in what he describes as the “battle of ideas,” and that it “has done more than just keep liberal ideas alive; it has expanded and deepened liberal philosophy and spread liberal thought across the globe.”3Eamonn Butler.“A Short History of the Mont Pelerin Society” (PDF),Montpelerin.org. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.The Road from Mont Pelerin(Harvard University Press, 2009)describes MPS as a “directory of organized neoliberalism.”4Philip Mirowski and Dieter Plehwe (2009).The Road from Mont Pelerin. London, England. Harvard University Press.
Given this abstract “battle of ideas,” it can be difficult to accurately gauge the precise influence of the Mont Pelerin Society on policy. However, the group’s influence can be seen by the overlap between many of its members and their affiliation with some of the largest conservative think tank across the United States, and around the world. DeSmog research found that Mont Pelerin Society members are affiliated with over 100 organizations thatalso appear on the membership listof theAtlas Network,5“Global Directory,” Atlas Network.

Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/KCp8M
The Atlas Society, not to be confused with theAtlas Network, also includes individuals with affiliations to MPS. According toDeSmogresearch, Mont Pelerin members have ties to a wide range of conservative think tanks, many which have consistently denied the human influence on climate change. Some of the top groups tied to MPS through affiliations of its members include theCato Institute,The Hoover Institution, theHeritage Foundation, theReason Foundation, theFoundation for Economic Education, theAmerican Enterprise Institute, theCentre for the New Europe,George Mason University,Fraser Institute,Mercatus Center (George Mason University), and theHeartland Institute.
Membership lists obtained byDeSmogdating to 2010and, more recently, 2013 show that organizations represented by the MPS have deep ties to the Koch network. Charles Koch himself is a long-standing member of the Society.DeSmogdug into individual member affiliations, and found that Koch foundations have poured more than $100 million into at least 54 groups connected to individual MPS members.8“Mont Pelerin Society A Window Into Ideological Heart Of Kochtopus Climate Denial,”DeSmog, January 27, 2014.",https://www.desmog.com/mont-pelerin-society/,https://www.desmog.com/climate-disinformation-database/

There is also the lack of pipelines preventing our resources from reaching external markets, new rules that make the project approval process more burdensome, as well as a new clean fuel standard, which is actually no more and no less than another carbon tax under a different name,” MLIwrote in its 2019 annual report.85“Annual Report 2019” (PDF),MEI.

“The cumulative effect of all of these measures, as our researchers explained in an in-depthResearch Paper, is going to end up stifling Canada’s oil industry, which is already being treated pretty roughly.”

“Cases in which our contribution has had a concrete influence on the way debates have played out are more and more numerous, especially in Quebec. In recent years, a series of government decisions have been announced that were clearly inspired by solutions we proposed. Among others, there is the activity-based funding of hospitals,the end of new Hydro-Québec contracts for costly wind energy production, the expansion of responsibilities for nurse practitioners, the use of cadets to direct traffic in Montreal in order to reduce the cost of police services, and the transition plan for the taxi industry inQuebec following the arrival of Uber.”
MEI also claimed victories on two anti-electric vehicle initiatives in the 2017 year:
”We hit two home runs with in-depth publications on electric vehicles.

In the video, MEI claimed, “Despite the benefits of this resource, certain activist groups want to drastically and rapidly restrict our use of oil.”

“This publication placed the need to fight climate change in a rational context, analyzing costs and benefits, both economic and environmental, of certain measures for tackling this issue,” MEIwrote in its annual report. “[…] we clarified, using facts and figures, a discussion too often inundated by political exaggerations or stirred up by alarmist talk.”100“Annual Report 2015” (PDF),Montreal Economic Institute. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
The report makes several claims, such as that “Subsidies for renewable energy and for electric vehicles, or adding ethanol to gasoline, are ineffective in meeting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”
The report summarized another chapter on adapting to climate change: “The global rate of mortality due to extreme weather events has fallen by 98% since the 1920s, showing that human vulnerability to climate is due mostly to economic conditions.”
“Malnutrition, diarrhea and malaria, made more frequent by climate change, are risks associated mainlywith poverty. […] Access to cheap electricity is therefore a significant means of improving current health conditions, even if this electricity comes from fossil energy.”

“While not perfect, petroleum-based products were clearly superior alternatives to the technologies they displaced and are still superior to the heavily-subsidized alternatives now touted as substitutes,” Desrochers and Shimizu wrote. “For instance, wind and solar power can only deliver small and intermittent volumes of electricity. They are useless in virtually all segments of the transportation sector and provide no feedstock to other lines of work.”
The paper also aims to illustrate how “Alberta’s oil sands are being exploited and illustrates how ‘win-win-win’ innovations are now taking place that are making this industry more efficient and more environmentally friendly.”

The report said that climate science was an example of how “sloppy procedures […] allow for progressive skews and inhibitions on scientific research, especially in ideologically driven fields” and contended that the scientific consensus on climate change was “artificial”:
NASportrayed modern climate science as “groupthink,” and claimed that climate researchers “readily accept results that confirm a liberal world-view,” citing for evidence the work of American climatologist and climate skepticJudith Curry:
The report’s conclusion recommended “the earliest possible reproducibility assessment of regulations concerning climate change (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)); air pollution (EPA); pharmaceuticals approval (Food and Drug Administration); biological effects of nuclear radiation (Department of Energy); the identification and assessment of learning disabilities (Department of Education); and dietary guidelines (United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)).”

The National Association of Scholarspublished “Inside Divestment: The Illiberal Movement  to Turn a Generation Against Fossil Fuels,” authored by Rachelle Peterson. The report’s executive summary described the fossil fuel divestment movement as “an attack on freedom of inquiry and responsible social advocacy in American higher education.”24Rachelle Peterson. “Inside Divestment: The Illiberal Movement  to Turn a Generation Against Fossil Fuels” (PDF),NAS, November 2015.

The National Association of Scholars released “Sustainability: Higher Education’s New Fundamentalism,” authored by Rachelle Peterson andNASpresident Peter Wood. In a chapter titled “The Global Warming Debate,” the report presented thedebunked “Climategate”scandal as evidence for reason to reject the scientific consensus that climate change has been caused by burning fossil fuels.25Rachelle Peterson and Peter W. Wood.“Sustainability: Higher Education’s New Fundamentalism” (PDF),NAS, March 2015.
While the report claimed that NAS “takes no position on the existence of global warming or subsidiary issues, including its causes,” it also stated that “claims advanced merely on the assumption that the theory of global warming is valid rest on highly insecure foundations.”
The report claimed to provide an even-handed treatment of climate issues. However, in the “Global Warming: Yes” section, it pivoted away from established science to discuss the sustainability movement and redistribution of wealth (“economic resources, too, are rationed and distributed equally, so that no one can hoard wealth or prevent the lowest rungs of society from climbing the economic ladder”), and attempted to tie climate change to controversial issues like gay marriage and abortion:
“To get to this better world, policies that uplift underprivileged groups such as women, racial minorities, the disabled, and those who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual require special consideration. Contraception, abortion, policies to close wage gaps, the legal recognition of gay marriage, affirmative action, and other social measures are thus linked with social sustainability.”
In the “Global Warming: No” section, the report claimed that temperatures have not been rising, primarily citing prominent skeptics includingDavid Whitehouse,Paul C. “Chip” Knappenberger,Patrick J. Michaels,Anthony Watts,James Taylor,Bjorn Lomborg,William Happer,Richard Lindzen,James Delingpole,Ross McKitrick,Steve Goreham, andStephen McIntyre.

According to the National Association of Scholars, “college administrations are often more committed to diversity than to the pursuit of truth.”NAShas also suggested in the past that it could be “dangerous” to join the organization: “We recognize that graduate students and untenured faculty members run a risk if they join an organization that is famous for challenging campus orthodoxies.

The report refers to a group of “reactionary environmentalists” who “do not believe in human progress,” who “idealiz[e] the life of the American Indian or life in medieval communities.” According to the authors, this group is “united by a distaste for modern industrial society and what borders on worship of the peasant way of life.”
The NCPA report classifies this group as “Anti-Human,” “Anti-Technology,” “Anti-Science,” “Anti-Growth,” “Anti-Free Enterprise,” and as “The Disaster Lobby” by “thriv[ing]” on crisis.
The report includes a section on climate change, that implies global warming would be beneficial. Some representative quotes from the report follow:
“… evidence suggests that warmth is life-enhancing and life-sustaining, whereas cold is life-threatening…”
“… atmospheric CO2 levels have varied radically as life on earth has evolved. Moreover, just as warmth has always been unambiguously good for life, so has CO2…”
“Although CO2 levels in the atmosphere have fluctuated over time, a secular decline in CO2 has been going on throughout the 4.5 billion-year history of the Earth. If this trend continues…eventually our planet will become as lifeless as Mars.”

LobbyistJack Abramoff, now a convicted and sentenced felon, was a member of NCPPR’s Board of Directors until his resignation in October 2004 after NCPPR concluded he had violated the organization’s conflict of interest policy.
In October 2002, Abramoff told President Amy Ridenour to send the Mississippi Band of Choctaws an invoice for $1 million. He then told Amy to distribute the funds as follows: “$450,000 to the Capital Athletic Foundation, $500,000 to Capital Campaign Strategies and $50,000 to a company called Nurnberger and Associates, run by a Mr. Ralph Nurnberger.”46“Hearing Before The Committee On Indian Affairs United States Senate One Hundred Ninth Congress First Session On Oversight Hearing Regarding Tribal Lobbying Matters, Et Al,” Senate Hearing 109-135, From the U.S. Government Printing Office, June 22, 2005.

“It was not until 2004 that I learned that this money did not come from the Choctaw, but rather from an Internet gambling company apparently unrelated to the Choctaw Tribe […] I would have never issued any money to Kaygold if I had known that Jack was the owner because this was a clear violation of the National Center’s conflict of interest policy, which Jack had signed,” she said.47“Statement of Amy Moritz Ridenour At the Hearing before the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on Lobbying practices Involving Indian Tribes”(PDF), Committee on Indian Affairs United States Senate, June 22, 2005.

John Redwood, who signed a NZSG letter in 2023, said “The Government needs to listen to the Germans and take advice on this. The more permissive an economy is, and the fewer bans there are, the better to promote growth.”
Greg Smith, who is also a member of the transport select committee said:
“The 2030 ambition isn’t realistic in the first place and we need the innovators and the automotive companies to be given the time and space to produce new technologies and solutions, not just jump the betamax that’s available now.”

Commenting on the North Sea Transition Deal, which aims toreduceoffshore production emissions by 10 percent by 2025 and 50 percent by 2030, Michie argued that: “Scotland is a key player here, and work is already under way to advance expertise in low-cost carbon capture and storage,” adding: “This involves repurposing legacy oil and gas fields to capture and store carbon, offering vast potential for clean energy production.”42“North Sea Transition Deal,”GOV.UK,March 24, 2021.Archived June 7, 2021.

In response to aTelegraphreport about the government considering a ban on new exploration licences in the UK North Sea, OGUK’s Director of Sustainability Michael Tholensaidthat “any curtailment of activity by licensing constraints risks impeding the UK’s ability to deliver a net-zero future, damaging our domestic supply chain, and increasing energy imports whilst exporting the jobs and skills.”45Rachel Millard and Emma Gatten. “Beginning of end for North Sea as ministers consider exploration ban,”The Telegraph,March 13, 2021.Archived May 20, 2021.

He added:
“The UK’s offshore oil and gas industry recognizes the urgent need for change and was one of the first sectors to commit to be a net-zero industry by 2050, setting demanding interim targets to halve its own emissions by 2030,” and that the industry could work with the government and the public to “help deliver the energy transition, providing the oil and gas the UK will need for decades to come while cutting the impact on the environment.”

In an interview withS&P Globalabout the recovery of the UK North Sea oil and gas industry after the COVID-19 pandemic, OGUK’s Director of Sustainability Michael Tholensaidof the challenge presented to the industry by climate change and environmental campaigners: “The issue is how the production arm… and how the supply chain arm of our sector also adapts and transforms, and the question is how do we do that in a way that’s least damaging to the environment and most beneficial to the economy.”47Nick Coleman. “Interview: Low-carbon electrification key to North Sea revival: OGUK,”S&P Global, February 18, 2021.Archived July 28, 2021.

Tholen said that he was “confident investment [in the industry] will pick up” after its struggles during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Tholen also noted that electrification of offshore facilities would be key for upcoming oil and gas developments in the North Sea, including developments off the coast of Shetland like Siccar Point Energy and Shell’s Cambo field. Tholen said: “I’m pretty convinced all the operators looking at new field developments West of Shetlands [sic] recognize they’re going to have to be — if not immediately already ready — then designed to flip over to electricity import to the platforms.”

“We have to get rid of this myth that fossil fuels are somehow bad,” Turner said. “The Environmental Left did this for years to the coal industry, right?

Art Robinson of the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine organized the Oregon Petition.According to OISM, the Petition Project was separate from Robinson’s work at the Institute and the project did “not utilize any Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine resources or funds.”8“Arthur B. Robinson,” Profile at the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine.  Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/PeqWU9“Home,” Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine.  Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/Qf5sO
The Petition Project, however, does appear to be a project of OISM, listed as a “related site” on their homepage. According to OISM, “several members of the Institute’s staff are also well known for their work on the Petition Project,” which was funded by “private donations by interested individuals, primarily readers of the newsletter Access to Energy …”
TheAccess to Energynewsletter also appears to be run by Art Robinson.
OISM published Art Robinson’s paper, “Environmental Effects of Increased Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide” which concluded that climate change was a result of normal solar activity and part of a natural cycle.
According to Robinson, carbon dioxide increases would result in “an increasingly lush environment for plants and animals.”10Dave Mazza. “Hot Air,”Willamette Week, January 7, 2009.  Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/pA6xy
Other authors of the papers included Art Robinson’s son, Noah E. Robinson, and the well-known industry-funded climate change skepticWillie Soon.

PRI senior fellow Wayne Winegarden wrote a Pacific Research Institute report titled“Zapped! How California’s Punishing Energy Agenda Hurts the Working Class” (PDF).24“Zapped! How California’s Punishing Energy Agenda Hurts the Working Class” (PDF),Pacific Research Institute, February 2022. Archived .pdf on file at DeSmog.
“The substantial financial benefits that low-income and middle-class families could realize from cheaper electricity provides evidence that policymakers should choose energy affordability rather than energy poverty,” Winegarden concluded. He added, “repealing these costly mandates, taxes, and regulations that artificially drive up the costs of traditional energy sources will help lessen the state’s unaffordable energy environment.”
Winegarden’s report wascited in theNorthern California Record, where he commented “Policymakers should be alarmed at the large energy burdens and high rates of energy poverty. Instead of relying on untested and expensive energy sources, we should be alleviating these burdens.”25Sarah Downey. “New report details impact of rising electricity rates on California families,”Northern California Record, February 8, 2022. Archived February 8, 2022. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/LAQE3
He also opposed fracking bans in California:
“Renewable mandates force electricity to be generated by sources that cost more. Cap and trade policies directly impose a tax on electricity use.
“Eliminating these taxes and mandates removes the costs, which will directly benefit families by lowering their electricity costs,” he claimed.

“I want to move genuine humanities education out of the universities, where it isn’t being taught anyways as far as I can tell, online where people can access it freely,” Peterson claimed.
In terms of costs to students, Peterson said, “We’re not sure exactly how it would run. But one possibility would be a monthly subscription that would help pay for the content. But the primary source of revenue would be on the accreditation end, on the examination end for sure.”
When asked about content, Peterson said:37“Jordan Peterson aims to start his an online university | Your Morning,” YouTube video uploaded by user “CTV Your Morning,” July 18, 2017. Archived .mp4 on file at DeSmog.
“[W]e would probably start with a list of the 100 greatest books of Western civilization. I think we’d started as a great books program, and we’re thinking about making a timeline. Imagine a timeline that stretches, say, from 3000 B.C. up to the present time that you could zoom in on and imagine lectures that would be available at different levels of resolution.
“So, for example, you might have a lecture about the 2000 to 1000 B.C. and the major occurrences during that period that you could zoom in and get specialty lectures where the historical knowledge was detailed enough to provide information at that level of resolution.
“And then the content, I don’t know yet. I think getting the underlying technical structure right at the moment is more important than the content, because I think content would generate itself if the incentive systems were set up properly.”
Asked why his online university would work more effectively than traditional ones, Peterson claimed that “the traditional universities have abandoned the humanities. They’ve become almost entirely corrupt as far as I can tell.”38“Jordan Peterson aims to start his an online university | Your Morning,” YouTube video uploaded by user “CTV Your Morning,” July 18, 2017.

“The humanities have been dominated by a kind of post-modern neo Marxist, what would you call it? Cult ideology since the 1990s, probably starting in the 1960s. And so they’ve abandoned their mission to students,” he said, adding “I think it’s a scam, pretty much from top to bottom, and it’s a very expensive scam.”
Peterson said it would start with a website in the next month and a half that would “help students and their parents identify postmodern content in courses so that they can avoid them.” He said, “our plan initially is to cut off the supply to the people who are running the indoctrination cults.”39“Jordan Peterson aims to start his an online university | Your Morning,” YouTube video uploaded by user “CTV Your Morning,” July 18, 2017.

In response to the presentation,RNCmember Morton Blackwell said he would push theRNCto “devote significant resources” into “ballot integrity.” He added that with the previous court-ordered ban lifted, theRNCnow had “unrestricted authority to weigh in on ballot security operations.”
The 1981 judicial consent decree had originally been imposed as a result of the 1981 New Jersey gubernatorial election, where, as theInterceptdescribed, “RNCofficials sent nonforwardable letters to voters in heavily African American neighborhoods. The party then recruited off-duty police officers, many of whom reportedly carried holstered guns, to patrol nonwhite precincts with lists of people whose names appeared on the 45,000 bounced letters, claiming that the list was enough evidence to show they were illegally voting.” The Democratic National Committee filed a lawsuit over the tactic, which resulted in the court order.

Some single videos netted over 150 million views in 2016, and the group boasts more than 2 million fans as well as a “student force” from universities around the world. The group’s 2017 impact report projects over 500 million views in 201. It describes their student group, “PragerFORCE,” as a “young digital army” of students “who spread the ideas and values of PragerU” on campuses.5Lisa Klug. “Super-conservative PragerU aims to arm pro-Israel students for their campus ‘wastelands’,”The Times of Israel, June 14, 2017.Archived August 29, 2017.

According to their website,PragerU’s missionis to “spread what we call ‘Americanism’ through the power of the Internet.” It does this through five-minute video segments, which it describes as “conservative sound bites that clarify profoundly significant and uniquely American concepts for more than 100 million people each year.”  Dennis Prager has described the group’s mission as combatting “liberal bias” at American universities. “The mission of Prager University is to arm people who are on our side with the intellectual ammunition they need to respond to these arguments, and to make the arguments really, really simple, so you don’t have to be a genius to understand them,” Prager has said.7“What We Do,”PragerU. Archived August 29, 2017.

“We take the best ideas from the best minds and distill them down to five focused minutes. We then add graphics and animation to create the most persuasive, entertaining, and educational case possible for the values that have made America and the West the source of so much liberty and wealth. These values are Judeo-Christian at their core and include the concepts of freedom of speech, a free press, free markets and a strong military to protect and project those values,” PragerU explains.9“What We Do,”PragerU. Archived August 29, 2017. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/k6zGc
The conservativeDaily Signalalso noted that PragerU videos generally don’t cite statistics or sources. Prager co-founder Allen Estrin said the reasoning for this is that the videos are narrated by “experts” who know the subject matter, and that viewers are expected to do their own research. After viewing the videos, “the individual does the rest,” Dennis Prager toldThe Daily Signal.10Madaline Donnelly. “How Dennis Prager’s Conservative Online University Reaches Millions,”The Daily Signal, November 4, 2015.Archived August 29, 2017.

PragerU boasts that thousands of teachers and professors use their videos as teaching supplements, and advertises the“PragerU Educators Network”as a resource designed to “bring truth back to the classroom.” According to thePrager U Educators page, “Students no longer learn that America is a land of opportunity, a defender of freedom around the world, and a source of pride. Instead, they are taught that America is a land of inequality, racism, imperialism, and, ultimately, shame that can only be redeemed through the adoption of leftist ideals.” It offers an alternative to “show both sides of the argument” and a call to action to “ensure that this generation of American students passes on the mantle of freedom to next generation, and doesn’t allow it to go extinct.” As of 2015, PragerU’s chief operating officer Marissa Streit said that this network included at least 3,000 educators.11“Bring Truth Back to the Classroom,”PragerU.Archived August 29, 2017.

PragerU also lists a number of petitions on its website, including one claiming that YouTube is censoring their content from younger viewers by putting total of 34 videos “under ‘restricted mode’ making it impossible for many young people to access our videos.” According to PragerU, this is a sign that “conservative ideas are under attack.”13“YouTube continues to restrict many PragerU videos.

A poll conducted by Wirthlin Worldwide and paid for by theAmerican Petroleum Instituterecommended a general message that emphasize “how petroleum improves the quality of life” and most importantly, “inoculate[s] against opposition messages.” To achieve inoculation, industry “needs to assuage the guilt of Americans concerned about global warming or the dangers of petrochemicals might feel about overusing petroleum products.”
Ratte stated that the problem is that “politically correct environmentalism invaded U.S. public classrooms years ago, and is helping to hold the door shut on your message.” Another problem she lists is that “children resonate with environmental topics.” She recommended tailoring industry materials to all subjects, including language arts to spread the message from all possible angles. In addition, she recommended that industry hold teacher workshops “in resorts or campuses in pleasant surroundings” to get educators to use their materials.
“If it has a corporate logo on it, it is propaganda… You need a foot in the door where somebody else is pushing he door open for you… The people best able to push open the door are non-profit education organizations that teachers already think of as being credible,” Ratte added.39“Get ‘Em While They’re Young: Oil and Gas Industry to Target School Kids in Re-Focus of PR Campaign,”CLEAR View, March 2, 1999.

In part two of a multipartDeSmoginvestigationof the reasons for oil train derailments, several experts toldDeSmogthat “sloshing”—the back-and-forth motion of the liquid contents of oil rail cars while a train is moving—could be a factor.26Justin Mikulka. “Why Do Oil Trains Derail More Often than Ethanol Trains?”DeSmog, September 15, 2016.
An AAR spokesperson responded by stating that sloshing “is something that has been studied over the decades and continues to be monitored, but, evidence to date indicates sloshing does not have an effect on overall train handling.” However,DeSmogwas unable to obtain copies of industry-funded studies and findings that sloshing was not a significant factor in derailments. AAR was “not in a position to release industry research at this time as it contains proprietary information,” according to the spokesperson.27Justin Mikulka. “Why Do Oil Trains Derail More Often than Ethanol Trains?”DeSmog, September 15, 2016.

As detailed in Brian Doherty’s book, Radicals for Capitalism, Reason magazine was created in 1968 by Rand follower Lanny Friedlander, who sold the magazine to Robert Poole in 1970. Koch and his aide de camp, George Pearson, submitted articles to the magazine from its early days, and Koch helped celebrate the magazine’s tenth anniversary. That celebration and brainstorming among ten key Reason magazine supporters in 1978 is what led to the creation of the Reason Foundation, which Poole at the helm. The Foundation became the publisher of the magazine and its own “think tank.” Over the years, both the magazine and foundation have had numerous ties with the Koch network, including key staff who led Charles Koch’s efforts at the Institute for Humane Studies, which he has helped guide since the 1960s. Notably, the free market magazine does not have sufficient subscribers to sustain it and has not for years.

Originally, the foundations were managed by Sarah Mellon Scaife. Effective January 1, 2015, The Carthage Foundation merged with and into the Sarah Scaife Foundation Incorporated and no longer provides donations.
The foundations are financed by the Mellon industrial, oil, and banking fortune. In 1869, the Mellon family created T. Mellon & Sons Bank. Later, the bank would be renamed Mellon Bank and become the largest bank in the state of Pennsylvania. The fortune of the Mellon family was also increased through significant investments in the Gulf Oil Corporation and the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA).
In 1957, whenFortunecreated its first list of the wealthiest Americans it estimated thatSarah Mellon Scaife, her brother, and two of her cousins, were all amongst the eight richest people in the United States—each with a fortune valued between $400-$700 million.
Richard Mellon Scaife, the son of Sarah Mellon Scaife, runs the Scaife Foundations.According toForbesmagazine, in 2008 Richard Mellon Scaife was worth $1.3 billion. Richard took charge of the Foundations in 1973. Currently, Richard runs the Sarah Mellon Scaife, Carthage, and Allegheny Foundations.

SecondStreet.org president Colin Craigwrote in theCalgary Heraldthat “Canada is committing economic suicide right now when it comes to natural resource development” by cancelling major oil, gas, or ming projects.52Colin Craig. “Opinion: Cost of cancelled projects is equal to building a new arena every day for a year,”Calgary Herald, March 9, 2020.

“[T]he environmental gain from cancelling these projects is negligible,” Craig claimed in the article. “By cancelling oil, gas and mining projects in Canada, all we’ve done is shift production of these resources to other countries — countries that don’t take the same care as our nation does with the environment.”

Now, they will be referred to as ‘partners’ because ‘investors’ has too transactional of a ring. These ‘investors’ have gathered twice a year — California in the winter, Colorado in the summer — for ‘seminars’ to discuss strategy.

Siccar Point EnergyUnited Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"July 4, 2022
Siccar Point Energy was officiallyacquiredby Ithaca Energy, which had announced in April 2022 that it would pay at least £1.1 billion for the company. Due to the acquisition, Ithaca Energy received stakes in the Cambo and Rosebank fields, two of the largest undeveloped fields in the UK North Sea. [20]
December 2, 2021
Despite pausing the development of the Cambo oil and gas field, Siccar Point Energystatedthat it would continue to engage with stakeholders and the UK government on the future of the project. [19]
CEO Jonathan Rogersaidthat “Cambo remains critical to the U.K’s energy security and economy,” adding that the project “will not only create over 1,000 direct jobs (as well as thousands more in the supply chain), but also help ease the U.K.’s transition to a low-carbon future.” [19]
July 19, 2021
A dozen activistsprotestedagainst Siccar Point’s proposed Cambo oil and gas field inside a UK government building in Edinburgh in the hope that the development would not go ahead. [13]
Siccar Point CEO Jonathan Rogersaidin response to the Stop Cambo campaign: “We respect people’s right to engage in dialogue, and to express their feelings and opinions in a safe and peaceful way.
“We have undertaken extensive consultation on the development, as rightly expected by Government, regulatory and public stakeholders.
“We are committed to developing Cambo in a responsible manner which helps the UK meet its net-zero targets.
“The majority of the UK’s energy needs are currently met by oil and gas and the Climate Change Committee and International Energy Agency have said that the UK will still need oil and gas for decades to come as part of the energy transition.”
Roger added that the Cambo development would “secure UK supply rather than rely on imports from less regulated countries, whilst creating more than 1,000 direct UK jobs and thousands more in the supply chain,” and said that the development “has been designed to reduce emissions from the outset and will be built ‘electrification’ ready with the potential to import renewable power when it becomes feasible in the future.” [13]
June 7, 2021
Siccar Point Energyannouncedplans to launch the Cambo oil project in the West of Shetland. [6]
Cambo is expected to have a lifespan of 25 years, bringing the termination date of the project to 2050, the year the UK has pledged to achieve net zero emissions. The public consultation period for the project ended on July 10, 2021. [7]
According to the company’s environmental impact assessment for the Cambo development, the “worst-case scenario” amount of carbon emissions generated by the project over its lifespan “during operations from fuel gas use, flaring and diesel use” is “estimated to be 3,451,597 tonnes of CO2 equivalents”. The company added that this estimate “does not take into account any potential future mitigation measures that may be introduced over the life of [the] field, such as electrification of the Cambo FPSO, in support of the overall government aim of net zero by 2050”.
The company added that “although neither technically nor economically viable from the outset at the start of production,” the development “has been designed to accommodate the installation of a future electrical infrastructure to facilitate electrical power” for the project’s infrastructure. [14]",,,"Siccar Point Energy is an oil and gas companybasedin Aberdeen that carries out exploration, development and production. According to itswebsite, the company is “focussed on high quality, low cost, long life assets on the UK Continental Shelf”. [1], [2]
As of July 2021, the company has an interest in 24 North Sea licences and isbackedby private equity firms BlueWaterEnergy and Blackstone Energy Partners. [3], [4]
Siccar Point has stakes in six projects including Rosebank, one of the UK’s largest undeveloped fields, and claims to have assets that “​​​​will produce through to the 2050s”. [5]
In 2021, Siccar Point Energy requested permission from the UK’s Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) todevelopa new oil and gas field off the coast of Shetland with its partner Shell. [6], [7]
An exploration licence for the field was issued in 2001, and the Cambo field is expected to produce oil and gas until 2050, with oil production expected to begin in 2025. [8]
Cambo would be one of the most significant new UK oil and gas developments to go ahead since the International Energy Agency (IEA)announcedin May 2021 that no new oil, gas, or coal projects could be developed if the world is to meet its target of net zero emissions by 2050. [9]

Researcher and commentatorBen Pilewrote anarticleforSpikedcriticising the UK’s Climate Assembly, a group assembled from UK citizens to discuss the response to climate change.72Ben Pile. “How the Climate Assembly manufactures consent,”Spiked, February 2, 2021.Archived February 8, 2021.

Pile characterised the Climate Assembly as an undemocratic institution created to artificially manufacture a mandate for allegedly unpopular environmental policies, writing: “It was XR who had demanded both Net Zero and a ‘citizens assembly’ to determine how it would be achieved. And the government, its departments and parliament duly agreed to Net Zero without a single vote cast. And here is where democracy was further abandoned.”
Elsewhere in the article, he wrote: “At every turn, activists, academics, politicians and lobbyists have been fully aware of the democratic deficit on climate policy. But they have sought to circumvent this in order to further their agenda.”

Fraser Myers, assistant editor ofSpiked, participated in adebateon BBC programmeThe Big Questionsentitled “Will COVID help us save the planet?” which discussed whether COVID-19 lockdown measures could form the basis for policies intended to counteract climate change.73“We don’t need a climate lockdown’: spiked’s Fraser Myers on BBC Big Questions,” YouTube video uploaded by user spiked on February 1, 2021. Archived.mp4 on file at Desmog
Myers implied that environmentalist policies would inevitably lead to reduced living standards, stating: “we’re living through a period of restraint and austerity. I don’t think there is going to be a lot of appetite for yet more restraint, and I think in fact it would be immoral to call for yet more restraint because we need to get the economy back on track, we need to get back to growth. Now more than ever we need to be expanding our potential and getting people back to living higher living standards.”
Myers also stated: “we’ve learnt what it’s like to live a reduced and nothing life. We’re existing, not really living, so I don’t see that as a model for going forward.”
Characterising decarbonisation of the economy as an authoritarian, state-imposed initiative, Myers said: “A lot of these environmental issues…it’s one thing saying we should take our own choices to cut down on XYZ, but at the end of the day a lot of this stuff is going to be imposed on us, if that’s the route we decide to go down with net zero. What happens if you don’t want someone to come into your house and retrofit everything?”

In an article titled“WARM FRONT: Print Media and Climate Change Coverage,”STATS described a “problem with the reportage involving global warming,” contrasting the view of Ross Gelbspan, who has written that a small group of industry-backed skeptics are dominating the debate, with the opposing view that “the dominant media have been not only neglectful of the full story, but they have actively muzzled contrary information at the same time they have credulously swallowed and amplified tenuous positive evidence.”36“WARM FRONT: Print Media and Climate Change Coverage.” STATS Spotlight.
The STATS discounts Gelbspan’s view, and goes ont o describe journalists “like trout in a media stream” who “seem to be practicing a version of what is termed ‘rational ignorance:’ the use of stereotype and prejudice as a rational response to a world overwhelming in detail or too challenging in scientific appraisal.”37“WARM FRONT: Print Media and Climate Change Coverage.” STATS Spotlight.
STATS claims that “no one has established what the ‘majority of climate scientists’ actually think” regarding how much warming has occurred over the last 100 or last 50 years. It goes on to criticize a report from Ozone Action. Regarding man-made influence on climate change, STATS claimed “there is not a firm consensus.”38“WARM FRONT: Print Media and Climate Change Coverage.” STATS Spotlight.

In the pieces, which were featured in theThe Denver Gazette17Jennifer Schubert-Akin. “PERSPECTIVE: Rethinking energy, climate, freedom and prosperity,”Denver Gazette, January 23, 2022. Archived March 11, 2022. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/L8yT9andThe Colorado Springs Gazette,she criticized President Biden’s decision to raise fuel mileage standards on vehicles, and described the Green New Deal as “the most radical energy policy proposal.”
“While these initiatives may be well-intended, they raise electricity prices and reduce reliability for American families, small businesses, and industries, diminishing individual freedom and economic prosperity,” Schubert-Atkins claimed. “These consequences must be included in energy and environmental policy discussions to help determine whether the benefits of green regulations outweigh the drawbacks.”
Additional excerpts:
“Cities, states, and nations are locked in a green energy arms race, competing to implement the strongest environmental policies to try to fight climate change. Yet policy makers largely overlook the losers of this emissions competition: ordinary Americans who face unreliable and expensive electricity as a result.”
”In the most extreme cases, green energy policies can result in death and destruction. Hundreds of Texans died last winter after a storm caused the state’s windmills, which provide about one-quarter of the state’s electricity, to freeze and the power grid to collapse.”
“The most common consequence of green energy policies is rising electricity prices. As environmental economist Bjorn Lomborg, who’s appearing at a Steamboat Institute energy policy summit in Steamboat Springs in March, explains in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed: ‘Limiting the use of fossil fuels requires making them more expensive and pushing people toward green alternatives that remain pricier and less efficient.’”
According to Schubert-Akin, natural gas production is to thank for CO2 reductions and worries about climate change are “overwrought”:
“[C]arbon dioxide levels are already plummeting under the current energy mix without the need for further mandates. Per-capita carbon dioxide emissions in the United States have fallen by nearly one-third since 2005. In Colorado, they’ve dropped by nearly 25 percent.
“This CO2 reduction, which results from the free-market shale energy revolution that has displaced high-emission coal with low-emission natural gas, too often goes unmentioned in energy policy debates. It suggests that incessant, alarmist claims about ‘a climate crisis’ — at least in this country — are overwrought.”

Homewood claimed that “the CCC have deliberately underplayed the true cost of their climate agenda”.
Homewood also asserted that the CCC sought to misrepresent the costs of mitigating climate change because “in reality [the CCC] are closely linked to the climate lobby” and “consequently they have a myopically one-sided view”.
Later in the piece, Homewood accused the World Health Organization (WHO) of “lies” and “misinformation” regarding their reporting of increased heatwave-related deaths in India due to climate change.

In a letter addressed to the Prime Minister titled “Net zero – a grim fairy tale”, Dr Deborah Ancellwrote:
She criticised the IPCC for “‘polishing’ the UN’s climate reports to ensure they continue the drama of ‘climate emergency’ (or some such doomsday title)” and suggested that there is “no evidential basis” for restricting carbon emissions “to pursue <2C temperature rise by 2050”.
Ancell also wrote that “CO2 is not our enemy. With no enemy, we have no need to fight. The pursuit of distant ‘net zero’ resembles fraud on a massive, taxpayer subsidised scale”. Instead, she claimed that “a slight warming accompanying increased CO2 should deliver a positive impact improving agricultural output” and that “increased warming should reduce winter heating costs (something you favour).”

Jones also repeated comments made byRichard Ticeat the rescheduled event that “we are only at ‘base camp’ on the climb to decarbonisation lunacy” and that Britain has a “national treasure” in the form of shale gas.
She also mentioned arguments made byNet Zero WatchauthorsAndrew MontfordandJohn Constable, and suggested that “pain and poverty” would be the result of net zero.
She concluded: “Even more sinister than the catastrophic effects […] of the Government’s disastrous climate agenda is the censorship effected by a group of bullies to shut down a public conversation around Net Zero”.

Archived May 23, 2022. Archive URL:https://archive.ph/TZ0UD
Bryce also argued that belief in climate change is due to “a domino effect known as an Amplifying Cascade of Systemic Bias”, which, he claimed, is reinforced by a “tendency not to report negative results, to manipulate data, refuse to share it with known critics and failure to accede to the full peer review process”.
Bryce concluded by claiming that “we are crossing the threshold into a period known as a Grand Solar Minimum, ushering in a prolonged cooling period”. Consequently, he argued, “the net zero obsession will gradually fade” along with “pursuit of a pointless net zero pipedream”.

Spedding disputed that cattle farming had deleterious effects on the environment, writing: “Universities and farmers around the world have proved that regular movement of herds of livestock to fresh grass, in a way which mimics nature, increases carbon storage in the ground and simultaneously improves soil fertility.” He added: “Wild herds of ruminants have been doing this for 50million years, a timescale which suggests to me that it is ‘sustainable.’”
Elsewhere in the article, Spedding downplayed the severity of climate change, arguing that media coverage had fuelled an overestimation of its impacts. He wrote: “Daily fearmongering across mainstream media has shown that people can be persuaded to believe implausible ideas if they have already been made to feel sufficiently scared.”

H. Sterling Burnett featured guest speaker Jason Isaac, director of theTexas Public Policy Foundation‘sLife:Poweredproject, onan episode of theHeartland Daily Podcast.27“POLITICIANS ARE RUINING TEXAS’ POWER GRID (GUEST: JASON ISAAC),”The Heartland Institute. Archived .mp3 on file at DeSmog.
“As it stands, subsidized renewable power sources forced onto the system have left Texans vulnerable to power outages, a problem that could worsen in the future,” Burnett claimed in the podcast’s description.
Discussing the Texas power outages in 2021, Burnett commented:
“I’m saying we used to have other coal plants, but they were not just off line they had been closed. We had a lot of wind and solar, more wind in Texas than solar, but some solar that suddenly was politically mandated, but was not putting power on the grid. So that’s the day. But what built up to it?”
Jason Isaac responded:

Wait Until You See the Tab,”RealClear Energy, April 28, 2020. Archived April 30, 2020. Archive URL:https://archive.vn/wip/yvNFs

This significant, needless, and unjust cost is a very real regressive tax on American families that has made our country worse off.”31CAFE-Coaliton-to-Trump-April-2020-9 (PDF),American Energy Alliance.

The campaign was branded with the slogan “End Renewable Energy Subsidies.” In one op-ed titled “Renewable energy subsidies are wrong for Texas,” aTPPFpolicy analyst decries subsidies for wind power suggesting they cause the closure of coal plants:36Cutter W.

As the Observer noted, whileTPPFargued that wind turbines were unsightly, it had previously fought against fracking bans. In Denton, Texas, a few years previously, “Fracking wells were popping up everywhere, including right next to homes, playgrounds and hospitals. They looked ugly, made noise, featured industrial lighting and exposed people to pollution.”TPPFfought against the Denton ban in the next legislative session, arguing there were already sufficient means for “residents who have legitimate concerns about nuisance” to “seek relief in the courts, and within Texas’ existing regulatory framework.”40Cutter W.

On August 15,TPPFmade a presentation in Georgetown at an event titled “100% Renewable Isn’t Doable.” According to the Observer, “Much ofTPPF’s information was incomplete or missing context” and some “was flat-out wrong,” pointing to an argument by one speaker that large-scale renewable production is impossible because they are “dependent on rare earth metals controlled by the Chinese.”41Cutter W.

“The overall goals of the media plan are to: (i) raise the awareness level of the use of unsound science in public policy decision making among target audiences; (ii) educate publics on the impact of this issue; and (iii) lay the groundwork and provide an environment for a successful grassroots mobilization effortto assist Phillip Morris with its issues nationally and in target states.”3Revised Plan for the Public Launching of TASSC (Through 1993) (PDF).
According to a2001 report in theAmerican Journal of Public Health(PDF), Philip Morris created TASSC to help it fight smoking restrictions while minimizing the group’s visible connections to the tobacco industry.

The paper promotes nuclear energy as “safe, clean, and green energy production,” and also suggests technological alternatives that will “reduce production costs, clean up existing carbon energy production practices (our coal production here in Virginia can continue with some of these technologies and without the EPA literally shutting down our mines), and perhaps revolutionize energy production, efficiency and environmental protection for years to come.”36Bob Hartwell.“New Technologies for Coping with Climate Change in Virginia” (PDF), The Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy.

Schnare’spowerpoint presentation (PDF)includes a slide titled “The Uncertain Basis of Climate Change Policy” where he contends that “The IPCC estimates on whether emissions of greenhouse gases will warm or cool the planet is very uncertain, and the amount they will do so is very uncertain.” According to Schanre,  “In light of this massive uncertainty, economic commitments to address climate change should be done in pieces and over several decades, depending on new knowledge from emerging science.”39“Climate Change and Geoengineering,”Center for Environmental Stewardship at the Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy.

According to Schnare’s paper, the “Uncomfortable Middle Ground […] calls for geoengineering as a means to put off the most catastrophic potential effects of global warming, at least for a few decades; an immediate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) where those reductions actually save money (the “no regrets” alternatives); significantly expanded use of and research on low-cost carbon sequestration that removes GHGs from the atmosphere or reduces carbon emissions; and some breathing space within which to further assess some of the global warming theories that, if disproved, would point humanity toward lesser reliance on alternative climate change responses.”42David W.

According Schnare, the first truth is that “Greenhouse gas reduction goals…are both unachievable and irrelevant,” the second truth is that “there will be no climate catastrophe due to CO2 because either the science is wrong or we will use geoengineering” and the third truth is that, if the IPCC predictions are true “Then, as the first truth states, it’s too late, and the climate scientific community has admitted as much.”44David Schnare. “Four Truths about Climate Change,”The Jefferson Journal, November 3, 2008.Archived .doc on file at DeSmog.

In a January 2019 hearing, Floyd Gaibler, a representative for the USGC,set out the USGC’s demandsfor a post-Brexit Trade Deal between the US and the UK. This included requirements that the UK significantly roll back regulations around pesticides and GMOs.
Gaibler said that current regulations “negatively impact” US imports, and called for the UK to adopt a new “science-based” approach, abandoning the use of the EU’s “precautionary principle”, which hasled torestrictions on a large number of US pesticides due to health and environmental concerns.
Gaibler and the USGC also called for the removal of tariffs on US ethanol for fuel use, and for the end of the EU anti-dumping duty on ethanol, which wasremovedby EU regulators later that year. The anti-dumping duty wasimposedby the EU in 2013 after European ethanol producerscomplainedUS producers were selling to the EU at unfairly low prices. In May 2019, the EU Commission eliminated the duties, claiming there was no longer a legal basis for the policy.69“Transcript – Public Hearing on Negotiating Objectives for a US-UK Trade Agreement (PDF),”Trade Policy Staff Committee, Office of the United States Trade Representative.

The TV and Youtube ads for “Powering Progress” opened with a man who said, “In the UK, 1.4 million households use 100 percent renewable electricity from Shell.” The ad then switched to a man installing an EV charging point who said, “Shell aims to fit 50,000 chargers nationwide by 2025.” Then a man in a Shell uniform at a gas station said, “And with more electric car charge points coming to Shell forecourts near you, the UK is ready for cleaner energy.”
Adfree Cities complained that the campaign misled consumers by failing to note that a large majority of Shell’s business dealt with fossil fuel extraction, not clean energy. Shell responded to the complaint by stating:
“Because the ads’ purpose was to promote low-carbon energy, [Shell’s media department] believed that any mention of high-carbon Shell products would have been counterproductive. Information about those Shell products would have only served to highlight their existence and availability, and thereby dilute the impact of the ads’ positive environmental message.”16“ASA Ruling on Shell UK Ltd t/a Shell,”Advertising Standards Authority, June 7, 2023.

The Advertising Standards Authority acknowledged that consumers “broadly” knew that a large part of Shell’s business was related to fossil fuels. But the organization also found that consumers knew these corporations were under pressure to transition away from fossil fuels, and could be misled by the extent to which Shell would be relying on renewable energy in the near future.

“Why would Congress want to give BLM redundant powers to regulate air quality that is already granted to EPA and the states through the Clean Air Act?” She asked. “EPA rules are applicable on public lands, of course, so why the inefficient duplication? The answer can only be that the bill is following the example of the Obama Administration in doing an end-run around the Clean Air Act and its processes for regulating existing sources properly.”
She also criticized a bonding bill that would address the cleanup of orphan wells by the oil industry claiming that “If bond levels are raised too high, as they are in the bill, it ties up significant amounts of capital in an unproductive capacity, adding another cost that, in combination with all the other costs of operating on federal lands, leads to less production.”
On a bill regarding royalties, she claimed “Raising royalty rates on federal lands will make them even less competitive with adjacent non-federal lands because the federal government, through acts of Congress and Executive Branch policies, has already determined that it would rather extract more in regulatory costs than it can garner in direct royalty revenue.”

The Washington Postreportedthat Dominion Energy, along with partner companies and theAmerican Gas Association, funded both Your Energy Virginia and EnergySure to create what it described as a grassroots “campaign to elect a pipeline” to support its proposed natural gas pipeline.40“‘Campaign to elect a pipeline:’ Va.’s most powerful company ran multi-front fight,”The Washington Post, November 29, 2017.Archived December 4, 2017.

An industry presentation not intended for the public but briefly visible on the Amercan Gas Association’s website,published here byThe Washington Post,  showed the scope of the effort, including a “supporter database” of more than 23,000 names, 150 letters to the editor, more than 9,000 cards and mailers to regulators and elected officials, as and over 11,000 calls to Virginia U.S. senators.41“Dominion Energy’s Power Point to industry insiders details its campaign to build support for its controversial pipeline,”The Washington Post.

The Washington Postnotesthat, “the ‘radical and uniformed elements’ are, in many cases, landowners whose property is targeted by pipeline firms and electric utilities for surveying and perhaps takeover by eminent domain. In some cases, the property has been in the owners’ families for decades if not centuries. Some are working farms; others are retirement havens for older residents.”46Peter Galuszka. “An energy group is fronting a pro-pipeline campaign in Virginia,”The Washington Post, June 12, 2017.Archived June 13, 2017.

Your Energy released apro-natural-gas ad on YouTube(now listed as “private” on YouTube) andfeatured prominently on the group’s website. “Stopping natural gas stops progress,” reads the text, while the narrator describes natural gas as “the friend that’s always been there.”47“Meet Natural Gas,” YouTube video uploaded by user Your Energy America, May 1, 2017.",,,"Your Energy America (YEA)is a front group created in May 2017 by theAmerican Gas Association (AGA)to promote natural gas use and undermine environmental advocacy campaigns against new natural gas pipelines and infrastructure.1“About Us,”Your Energy.

According to Your Energy’swebsite, “Your Energy was created to speak out against a misguided movement that assaults our way of life. This movement is based on the simplistic belief that keeping our natural resources in the ground is the only solution to climate change. This isn’t just false — it’s dangerous to our quality of life, economy and energy security.”3“About Us,”American Gas Association. Archived June 13, 2017. Archive.is URL:https://archive.is/lkQDz
HuffPostreportedthat Your Energy has positioned itself as a grassroots organization in support of natural gas. The only indication that Your Energy is a public relations campaign paid for by industry is apparent on itsPrivace Policy Page, which openly states that they are “supported by the American Gas Association, and Related Organizations.” Promotion of such “fake grassroots” campaigns is sometimes referred to as an“astroturfing.”4Alexander C.
