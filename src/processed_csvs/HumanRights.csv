In re Federal Climate Protection Act Austria,2023,,Decided,"Suits against governments, Human Rights, Other","Austria, Constitutional Court","Austria, Comprehensive Environmental Protection, Austria, Water and Food Security as well as Research, Austria, Basic Law on the General Rights of Nationals, Austria, Federal Constitutional Act on Sustainability, Austria, Animal Protection, Austria, Climate Protection Act of 2011, Austria, Constitution, International Law, European Convention on Human Rights","In 2023, the applicant filed a complaint with the Austrian Constitutional Court and alleged that Art 3 of the Federal Climate Protection Act (Klimaschutzgesetz) was unconstitutional for not ensuring Austria’s compliance with international and European greenhouse gas reduction obligations, thereby violating fundamental rights.
The Federal Climate Protection Act was adopted in 2011 to implement emission reduction obligations under international and European Law. According to Art 3 para 1 of the Act, the maximum permissible GHG emissions shall be defined in the annexes to the Act and distributed among sectors. The annexes accordingly provide for maximum GHG emissions for 2008-2012 and 2013-2020; the Act does not stipulate any emission reduction targets after 2020. In addition, Art 3 para 2 Federal Climate Protection Act provides a (mere) negotiation obligation regarding measures that ensure compliance with maximum GHG emissions.

Communication to Thailand on forced evictions for climate mitigation measures,2022,AL THA 3/2022,Pending,"Suits against governments, Just transition","United Nations, UN Special Procedures, United Nations Special Rapporteurs","International Law, ICESCR (International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), International Law, UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-Based Evictions and Displacement, International Law, UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas","On December 1, 2022, eight UN Special Procedures on the right to adequate housing, climate change, environment, food, human rights defenders, minority issues, extreme poverty, and contemporary forms of racism, jointly issued a communication to Thailand expressing their deep concern about the (threat of) forced eviction of 14 Isan minority members (9 women, 5 men), who are also land-right defenders, from their lands and homes in the Sab Wai village. The eviction orders were issued in pursuit of climate mitigation action under forest conservation policies and legislation, without provision of alternative accommodation and productive land, nor adequate compensation.
According to information received, Thailand’s updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) set aims to reduce GHGs by 20% compared to ‘business as usual by 2030, when compared to 2005 as the baseline year, and to achieve carbon (CO2) neutrality by 2050, and net-zero by 2065. A key strategy for meeting these objectives is to enhance forestry carbon sinks, including by reforestation, and improved conservation. The Thai government has adopted a 20-Year National Strategy, aiming to increase the country’s forested area to 55 percent of the total Thai territory by 2037 and adopted a Forest Reclamation Policy of 2014.
A key complaint is that the chosen strategy for meeting NDC targets negatively impacts, and even criminalizes forest-dependent communities, including minority and indigenous peoples and small-scale farmers and those having traditionally lived in or near national parks. An important concern is that the policies criminalize any person or entity which ‘destroys’ protected forests, which could include those who traditionally live and farm in protected area.  Those concerned call the strategy a ‘false solution’ to the climate crisis, for it moves attention away from necessary energy sector reforms. Moreover, despite earlier commitments that the Forest Reclamation Policy would primarily target large-scale investors and developers, and ‘protect the poor, landless and those who had settled in an area before it was declared as protected’, the actual implementation of the forestry policy is problematic.
Based on the forestry laws and policies, 14 Isan minority community members of the Sab Wai village in Chaiyaphum Province, central northeastern Thailand, are threatened by forced eviction from the lands they lived and farmed on since the 1970s, as they were identified as ‘forest destroyers’ under the current legislation. Their village is located in Sai Thong National Park, which was established in their living area in 1992.
According to the UN Special Procedures, the evictions constitute violations of international human rights law, since the villagers are not provided with alternative accommodation or productive land, nor adequate compensation. Actions to mitigate adverse effects of climate change must take into account negative impacts on the human rights of forest dependent communities, including especially their right to adequate standard of living, including food and housing. This is closely tied to communities’ right to land as well. The UN Special Procedures reaffirm forest-dependent minorities and communities’ ‘right to land, including the right to have access to, sustainably use and manage land and forests’. They ask how the Thai government intends to protect this right through measures aimed at legal recognition of ‘land tenure rights, including customary land tenure rights not currently protected by law’.
The communication is based on Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), as further interpreted through CESCR General Comment No. 4 on the Right to Adequate Housing, CESCR General Comment No. 7 on forced evictions, and the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-Based Evictions and Displacement. The latter clarifies, amongst others, that ‘evictions can only take place in 'exceptional circumstances'; that they must be authorized by law, and ensure full and fair compensation and rehabilitation’. The communication also outlines how ‘eviction-impact assessments’ should be carried out to explore alternatives and minimization of harm that may result from an inevitable eviction. The UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas was also cited, in recognition that ‘peasants and other people working in rural areas have the right to contribute to the design and implementation of national and local climate change adaptation and mitigation policies’.
Case specific observations on possible human rights violations and requests for further information, highlight that the Thai government’s forestry and environment-related laws and regulations, and their implementation, have discriminatory effects on specific ethnic groups and indigenous peoples, and that the Isan group more generally is subject to ‘direct and indirect, multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination’. They also ask how forest-dependent communities were consulted or participated in ‘the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of mitigation measures affecting them’, and what the outcomes of ‘human rights impact assessments of climate change mitigation measures’ have been. Specifically, consultation with the Isan minority villagers from the Sab Wai village should explore ‘feasible alternatives to the evictions, including the possibility to remain in situ or the provision of alternative land and housing and adequate compensation, and the outcome of these consultations’.
The Permanent Mission of Thailand in Geneva acknowledged receipt of the communication, but no formal response on behalf of the Thai government is registered in the communications repository to date.","Thailand’s large-scale (re)forestation strategy to achieve GHG emission targets threatens the human rights of 14 forest-dependent Isan minority members in Sab Wai village, who are also land-right defenders",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221201_AL-THA-32022_na.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/thailands-large-scale-reforestation-strategy-to-achieve-ghg-emission-targets-threatens-the-human-rights-of-14-forest-dependent-isan-minority-members-in-sab-wai-village-who-are-also-land-ri

In January 2021, a draft Climate Change Act was introduced to the Hessian state parliament. The bill is currently under review. Plaintiffs argued that the draft did not meet the constitutional obligations for climate protection. On the one hand, because it failed to specify a reliable reduction pathway for complying with the remaining CO2 budget on account of the lack of any annual target-setting. On the other, because it did not prescribe tools and mechanisms for achieving and reviewing the adequacy of the climate protection argues. Further, plaintiffs argued that the 2012 Hessian Energy Future Act was insufficient to fill these gaps, as it only sets a nonbinding target for the expansion of the renewable energy sector and thus also only for one of the sectors relevant for climate protection. Plaintiffs argued that this lack of more stringent targets at the state level violated their fundamental constitutional rights. Further, plaintiffs invoked the state’s duty to protect their fundamental rights, to request that the state legally stipulate a GHG emissions reduction pathway towards achieving climate neutrality by 2045, to comply with the Federal Climate Protection Act and the overarching 1.5°C temperature target, as informed by the Paris Agreement. This case is part of a series of eleven separate constitutional complaints supported by DUH against ten federal states, following the Constitutional Court’s Neubauer decision in 2021.",The lack of a climate protection law in the State of Hessen.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210909_14602_petition.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220118_14602_order.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/alena-hochstadt-et-al-v-state-of-hesse

The claimed rights include right to life, right to pursue happiness, right to general freedom, right to property, right to healthy environment, State’s obligation to provide its people from disasters, and State’s obligation to protect the fundamental rights of the people.
The 62 plaintiffs are children under age of five, including one fetus (named “Woodpecker”, who was later born after the filing of the case). The plaintiffs argue the current NDC (i) depletes South Korea’s per-capita-based carbon budget for 1.5 degrees and 1.7 degrees before 2030, (ii) falls short of the global reduction pathway presented in the IPCC 1.5 Special Report, and (iii) contributes to the Emission Gap pointed out by the UNEP. The plaintiffs argue that the current NDC will result in disastrous level of climate change leading to violation of their fundamental rights.
On February 19, 2024, the Court merged the case with two other constitutional cases challenging the same NDC, and one case challenging the implementation plan of the NDC, the 1st Carbon Neutrality Basic Plan.

The 123 plaintiffs are members of the civil society organization, leaders of political parties, and general citizens affected by climate change. The claimed rights include right to life, right to pursue happiness, right to general freedom, right to property, right to healthy environment, State’s obligation to provide its people from disasters, and State’s obligation to protect the fundamental rights of the people.
The plaintiffs argue the 35% threshold set by the provision of the law (i) depletes South Korea’s per-capita-based carbon budget for 1.5 degrees and 1.7 degrees before 2030, (ii) falls short of the global reduction pathway presented in the IPCC 1.5 Special Report, and (iii) contributes to the Emission Gap pointed out by the UNEP.

The court concluded that the state has a duty to take climate change mitigation measures due to the “severity of the consequences of climate change and the great risk of climate change occurring.” In reaching this conclusion, the court cited (without directly applying) Article 21 of the Dutch Constitution; EU emissions reduction targets; principles under the European Convention on Human Rights; the “no harm” principle of international law; the doctrine of hazardous negligence; the principle of fairness, the precautionary principle, and the sustainability principle embodied in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; and the principle of a high protection level, the precautionary principle, and the prevention principle embodied in the European climate policy.

In addition, it points to violations of human dignity and rights to health, life and an ecologically balanced environment, as well as a lack of commitment to addressing the climate issue.

Oil and gas exports are an important part of the Russian economy, the revenues of which make up 45% of Russia’s 2021 budget, according to the International Energy Agency. The imports of Russian oil and gas are governed by Regulation 2015/478 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2015 on common rules for imports. Article 1 of that Regulation states that such oil and gas shall be freely imported into the Union and shall not be subject to any quantitative restrictions. To decrease dependence on Russian oil and gas, the European Union has adopted REPowerEU, a plan to rapidly reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels and fast forward the green transition.

The action challenges Law 14.182/2021, which deals with the privatization of the national electricity company Eletrobras and promotes changes in the Brazilian electricity sector regime. The law derived from a provisional measure, which can only be adopted in exceptional circumstances. The plaintiffs argue that the provisional measure, which was then turned into the law in question, lacked the requirement of urgency, circumventing the regular legislative process. They claim that, when considering the conversion of the provisional measure, the National Congress approved amendments that resulted in substantial changes to Brazilian energy planning. The final wording of the provisions reveals an undue attempt to prevent a possible veto by the President of the Republic. The Law, under the terms approved, requires the mandatory contracting of energy from small hydroelectric power plants and natural gas thermoelectric plants. The plaintiffs argue that such a requirement makes the necessary decarbonization of the Brazilian energy matrix more distant and will lead to an increase in annual greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), in breach of the commitments made under the Paris Agreement and by the President of the Republic at COP26. The plaintiffs point out that the enactment of the Law violates the legal and constitutional order since it is contrary to the duty to act in favor of the protection of intact and stable climatic conditions.

Review Application Against Decision to Grant an Environmental Authorisation to Conduct Exploratory Drillings,2024,,Pending,"Suits against governments, Human Rights, Right to a healthy environment","South Africa, High Court","South Africa, Constitution, South Africa, National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998","In South Africa, the GREEN CONNECTION NPC and NATURAL JUSTICE (herein the applicants), initiated a review application against the decision of the Director General of the Department of Minerals and Energy (the DG) and the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries (the Minister) granting an environmental authorisation to conduct exploratory drillings off the South-West coast of South Africa. The application is based on the ground that the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) utilized by the DG and Minister to inform their decision did not adhere to the stipulated requirements outlined in the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 (NEMA) and the Integrated Coastal Management Act 24 of 2001 (ICMA).
The issue is whether the decision to grant environmental authorisation to conduct exploratory drilling off the South-West coast should be set aside in that it was taken without proper assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposed project. In praying for the authorisation to be set aside, it is the contention of the applicants that the decision to grant environmental authorization was made without a thorough assessment of the environmental ramifications of the proposed project, as the EIR fails to meet the standards set forth by NEMA and ICMA. The EIR failed to consider climate change impacts associated with the use of any oil or gas discovered by the Proposed Project and to evaluate potential trans-boundary impacts of an oil spill resulting from a well blowout, particularly concerning contamination in Namibian waters and international waters. It does not adequately assess the extent of socio-economic impacts, including potential revenue losses for fishing operations and coastal communities in the area. The authorisation itself flouts section 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa which guarantees the right to a healthy environment, protected for present and future generations. It infringes on the environmental impact assessment principles in National Environmental Management Act (NEMA) enacted to give effect to the constitutional rights related to environmental protection. Consequently, the decisions made regarding the environmental authorization for the proposed project are legally flawed and subject to review and potential reversal under the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act (PAJA).
In relation to jurisdiction, GREEN CONNECTION NPC and NATURAL JUSTICE   assert that the requirements for loca standi and jurisdiction have been satisfied, in that the application is brought in their own interest, in the public interest in terms of section 38(1)(c) of the Constitution and section 32(1)(d) of NEMA and in the interest of protecting the environment in terms of section 32(1)(e) of NEMA, and that the adverse effects of the decisions under review will be experienced in the Western Cape. Hence, the Court has jurisdiction in terms of section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 (PAJA).",Whether the decision to grant environmental authorisation to conduct exploratory drilling off the South-West coast should be set aside in that it was taken without proper assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposed project,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2024/20240320_67124_application.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/review-application-against-decision-to-grant-an-environmental-authorisation-to-conduct-exploratory-drillings

The plaintiffs question the adequacy of the administrative acts that structure the institutional design of the IncentivAuto Program - Automotive Regime for New Investments to the federal and state rules protecting the climate system, such as the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12. 187/2009) and the State Policy on Climate Change - PEMC (State Law 13.798/2009), and the international commitments made by Brazil, especially under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. The plaintiffs highlight the lack of transparency of the Program's information, which resulted in the separate filing of the Autonomous Action for the Advance Production of Evidence (No. 1047315-47.2020.8.26.0053).

Anton Foley and others v Sweden (Aurora Case),2022,,Pending,"Suits against governments, Human Rights, Other, Suits against governments, GHG emissions reduction and trading, Other","Sweden, Nacka District Court (Nacka tingsrätt)","International Law, European Convention on Human Rights","On November 25, 2022, a group of over 600 young people born between 1996 and 2015 filed a class action lawsuit against the Swedish state, arguing that Sweden’s action on mitigating climate change is inadequate and thus in violation of their rights under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). The complaint was lodged after two letters were sent to the Swedish state, one in May 2022 (to which the sitting Minister for Climate and Environment replied) and one in November 2022 following a change in government in October 2022 (to which there was no reply), where the plaintiffs outlined their requests. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the risk of the negative impacts of climate change constitutes interferences with their rights to life, private and family life, and non-discrimination under articles 2, 8, and 14 of the ECHR, respectively, as well as the right to property under article 1, protocol 1 of the ECHR. These interferences are argued to constitute rights violations since Sweden is failing to do its fair share to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration in the atmosphere to keep warming below 1.5°C as compared to pre-industrial levels, by not undertaking immediate and adequate procedural and substantive measures to continuously reduce GHG emissions and enhance GHG sinks, thus failing to adequately protect the plaintiffs from adverse impacts of anthropogenic climate change. In particular, the plaintiffs argue that climate change impacts in the period leading up to 2100 will be serious, especially in relation to impacts on human health, and that they are expected to be particularly affected by these impacts because expect to be alive at that time, based on the average life span in Sweden. In terms of specific impacts, the plaintiffs cite longer and more intense heatwaves causing both mild and severe health effects, shorter and more temperate winters leading to the increased spread of diseases through ticks, and changes to precipitation patterns leading to health impacts stemming from flooding, among others.","The adequacy of Sweden’s climate change mitigation policy, in possible violation of human rights protected by the ECHR.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220510_18245_na.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221107_18245_na.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221125_18245_application.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221125_18245_na.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220601_18245_na.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/anton-foley-and-others-v-sweden-aurora-case

However, the collapse of Finland’s carbon sinks in 2021 has created a situation where the government’s climate policy plans are insufficient for meeting the Climate Act’s targets.

Challenging Environmental Impact Assessment law for failing to consider climate change,2023,,Decided,,"Colombia, Constitutional Court","Colombia, Law 99 of 1993, Colombia, Constitution","On July 24, 2023, a group of citizens members of two NGOs (Dejusticia and Ilex Acción

definition and criteria of environmental impact assessments (EIA) in Colombia, which includes
biotic, abiotic and socioeconomic elements. Plaintiffs argue that as it stands this norm does not
abide by the constitutional and international human rights standards given the lack of
consideration of climate change and human rights. Plaintiffs assert that even though climate
change-related standards only appeared after the law was issued, failing to update the
interpretation of this legal provision results in unconstitutional restrictions and interpretation

The corresponding application thus was inadmissible (see http://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/greenpeace-v-austria/). On February 23, 2022, a previously uninvolved applicant – a consumer using both rail and air services – resubmitted the application. The applicant has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and suffers from the related Uthoff syndrome – symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis exacerbate in case of higher temperatures. At temperatures of 25°C, the applicant’s ability to walk is limited; at temperatures of 30°C, the applicant depends on a wheelchair and assistance from others. As a result of climate change, the number of warm and hot days in Austria steadily increased; the average temperature in Austria has already risen by 1.8°C (compared to the global average of 1°C). Thus, Austria is particularly affected by the climate crisis. Nevertheless, it further aggravates the climate crisis: Austrian tax law provides that the domestic part of cross-border passenger transportation by aviation companies is exempt from the turnover tax. Furthermore, paraffin – the fuel for air travel – is exempt from the mineral oil tax. On the other hand, passenger transportation by rail companies is not exempt from the turnover tax even though greenhouse gas emissions associated with a rail journey are, on average, 31 times lower than when traveling the same distance by airplane.","Whether tax advantages of aviation companies compared to railway companies violate the applicant’s fundamental rights to equality before the law, to life and to private and family life.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230627_19868_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/in-re-tax-benefits-for-aviation

Plaintiffs allege that the federal government has failed to comply with its own action plans to prevent deforestation and mitigate and adapt to climate change, violating national law and fundamental rights. Plaintiffs assert that the government has failed to meet the Brazilian emissions targets set out in the Climate Change National Policy Act, a binding act passed by the Brazilian legislature. In order to meet these targets, the federal government issued a decree setting out specific action plans for preventing and controlling deforestation in various Brazilian biomes, as well as outlining sectoral plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation. A key part of this decree is the Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in Legal Amazon (PPCDAm). By failing to meet critical targets in the PPCDAm and emissions targets, plaintiffs allege that the government is violating fundamental rights and national law.

The applicants alleged that the Federal Climate Protection Act (Klimaschutzgesetz 2011) is, in part, unconstitutional for violating the constitutionally guaranteed rights of children and the fundamental right to equality before the law. The Austrian Constitutional Court rejected the application as inadmissible by decision of 27 June 2023. According to the Court, the scope of the application was too narrow, and repealing the contested provisions would not have eliminated the underlying unconstitutionality. Relying on its earlier case law, the court, therefore, considered the application as inadmissible. Further, the court held that repealing the contested phrases would have given the contested provision of the Federal Climate Protection Act a different content.

The communication is also addressed to, and directly concerns, Saudi Aramco’s business activities in the fossil fuel sector. Saudi Aramco is a State-owned enterprise, owned for 98.5 per cent by the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It holds the exclusive right to explore, drill, prospect, appraise, develop, extract, recover and produce hydrocarbons, as well as to market and distribute hydrocarbons, petroleum products and liquid petroleum gas in the Kingdom. According to the communication, Saudi Amraco’s activities and business strategies are not aligned with the Paris Agreement goals, obligations and commitments, including the ambitions of the Saudi government, and Saudi Amraco’s own responsibilities for human rights protection as a business enterprise under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).
Specifically, despite Saudi Arabia’s net zero targets for 2060, and Saudi Aramco’s own ambition to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050 across its wholly owned operating assets, the company is maintaining production of crude oil; further exploring for oil and gas reserves; expanding into fossil fuel gas; and its misrepresenting information about GHG emissions. Rather than cutting fossil fuel production and emissions ‘at the rapid rate necessary to meet the 1.5°C climate mitigation goal’, it is expanding its fossil fuel activities based on the argument that it has ‘low-cost production’ compared to other countries.
According to the UN Special Procedures, this approach undermines ‘the ability of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to discharge its duties under international law and commitments in the context of the Paris Agreement’, and further ‘disregards Saudi Aramco’s own responsibility to reduce production to address its climate change-related human rights impacts’, as much as other companies. In fact, based on ‘the size, sector, operational context, ownership and structure of Saudi Aramco’ – including the fact that it is a State-owned company – and ‘in the context of the alleged contributions of its business operations to the severity of the human rights impacts of climate change’ over time, there is a ‘heightened expectation’ that this company takes its responsibility under international human rights law. Saudi Amraco bears ‘increased responsibility […] existing over and beyond compliance with applicable laws [...] to act fully in line with international standards and best practices to prevent and mitigate against the human rights impacts of climate change’.
International responsibilities to protect human rights by mitigating GHGs through its own business activities and products follow from the UNGPs (2011), HRC Resolution 48/13 (2021) and UNGA Resolution 76/300 (2022) on the Right to a Clean, Healthy and Sustainable Environment, and the UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment (2018). Special attention is drawn to the report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment on States’ obligations in relation to climate change (A/74/161), stating that ‘further exploration for additional fossil fuels’ must be prohibited because ‘not all existing reserves can be burned while still meeting the commitments of the Paris Agreement’. In addition, States must prohibit the most polluting and environmentally destructive fossil fuel activities, including ‘oil and gas produced from hydraulic fracturing’. All of this follows from the right to a healthy environment, and related human rights,  ‘including the rights to life, health, food, water, housing and culture’.
In relation to ‘access to information’, Saudi Arabia acts in violation of ‘international human rights standards that require that businesses should ensure adequate and accurate disclosure and reporting of their climate impacts in an accessible manner’. Saudi Amraco omits important information about Scope 3 emissions from its reporting and advertising, which is ‘inconsistent with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures standards’. Inaccurate information on GHG emissions can lead to underestimating the climate change crisis, and in turn, exacerbate negative human rights impact due to climate change. Therefore, all companies ‘should refrain from supporting and/or engaging in public information campaigns based on inaccurate, misleading, and unfounded assertions that harm the ability of States and the public to make informed decisions pertaining to climate change’.
Finally, the communications note that Saudi Amraco increasingly sought and received private financial support from a range of financial institutions, e.g. through borrowing funds, selling bonds or equities, or getting support for financial transactions, or for investments in its oil and gas infrastructures. Each of these financial activities help finance the harmful activities of Saudi Amraco that ‘are contributing to climate change-related human rights impacts’, in a manner that is contrary to the human rights responsibilities of these financial institutions.
In August-September 2023, Japan, UK and France responded to communication, as well as Société Générale S.A., Crédit Agricole S.A., BNP Paribas, HSBC, Mizuho Financial Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The companies all outline their respective approaches to human rights under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; OECD Guidelines; as well as Equator Principles, UN Global Compact or International Bill of Rights more generally.","Negative human rights impacts of (expanding) fossil fuel activities by State-owned company Saudi Amraco, with support of major private financial

The application alleges that the UK Government is in breach of their obligations under Articles 2, 3 and 8 of the Convention for failing to address the risks of the climate crisis, future pandemics and antibiotic resistance created by factory farming. This application poses novel climate arguments focusing on the danger of agricultural methane emissions, and highlighting soy feed consumption in UK factory farming as a key driver of deforestation in the Amazon basin. The application also cites for the first time before the ECHR the ruling of the Brazilian Supreme Court in PSB  et al v Brazil (on Climate Fund), which recognized the Paris Agreement as a human rights treaty. Given the urgency of the case and other pending climate cases before the ECHR, an application has been made for the case to be assessed on a priority basis.","Whether factory farming violates human rights due to the risks of the climate crisis, future pandemics and antibiotic resistance.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220726_17539_press-release.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/factory-farming-v-uk

Communication to the United Kingdom about the arrest and imprisonment of climate activists,2023,AL GBR 16/2023,Pending,,"United Nations, UN Special Procedures, United Nations Special Rapporteurs","International Law, ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), International Law, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Law, UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, International Law, UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment","On August 15, 2023, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in the Context of Climate Change, Mr. Fry, issued a communication to the United Kingdom about the arrest and imprisonment of climate activists Mr. Marcus Decker and Mr. Morgan Trowland.
On October 17, 2022, Mr. Decker and Mr. Trowland had climbed the 60 meters high Queen Elizabeth II Bridge in Dartford to hang up a banner reading “Just Stop Oil”. Both men stayed on the bridge in hammocks for 36 hours, at a height of 55 meter, blocking traffic on the bridge for around 40 hours. They were removed by the police. The aim of their action was to request the Government of the United Kingdom to refrain from engaging in all new oil and gas licences and consent and to put an end to oil and gas. The protest was nonviolent and peaceful.
On April 4, after a 7-day trial, Mr Decker and Mr. Trowland were convicted by a jury for causing public nuisance. Two weeks later, the Southend Crown Court sentenced them to 2 years and 7 months, and 3 years, respectively. The men unsuccessfully appealed against the length of their sentences, which they considered excessive and a ‘disproportionate interference with the exercise of their rights to the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The appeals court stated that no material error of principle had been made by the sentencing judge.
The UN Special Rapporteur on Climate Change, Mr. Fry, expressed concerns both regarding the arrest and severity of the sentences, especially since they were significantly more severe than previous sentences imposed for this type of offending in the past. He acknowledged the severity of the response may in part result from the new Public Order Bill of May 2022, which entered into force in May 2023, and which was the subject of a separate communication in December 2022 (JOL GBR 16/2022). Reiterating the unique severity of the climate crisis for human rights, and the importance of environmental human rights defenders in this context, the Rapporteur is ‘gravely concerned about the potential flow-on effect that the severity of the sentences could have on civil society and the work of activists, expressing concerns about the triple planetary crisis and, in particular, the impacts of climate change on human rights and on future generations’.
Stressing the right to peaceful assembly in Article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and its interpretation outlined in HRC General Comment No. 37, the rapporteur reiterates that ‘peaceful assemblies can in some cases be inherently or deliberately disruptive’, and as such require a ‘significant degree of toleration’. Any prohibitions on ‘public disorder’ in domestic laws, should not be used unduly to restrict peaceful assembly. States have both negative obligations not to interfere with rights of peaceful assembly, and positive obligations ‘to facilitate and protect these rights in accordance with international human rights standards’.

Communication to the government of Colombia about the humanitarian and environmental crisis suffered by the Afro-descendant Raizal people,2022,AL PAK 7/2022,Pending,,"United Nations, UN Special Procedures, United Nations Special Rapporteurs","International Law, ICESCR (International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), International Law, ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), International Law, UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment, International Law, UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement","On November 15, 2022, seven UN Special Rapporteurs on the right to adequate housing, climate change, cultural rights, right to food, the right to health, rights of internally displaced persons, and discrimination against Afro-decendants, jointly issued a communication to the government of Colombia about the humanitarian and environmental crisis suffered by the Afro-descendant Raizal people of the islands of Vieja Providencia and Santa Catalina, after category 4 and 5 hurricanes Eta and Iota in November 2020.
Nearly two years later, about 5,000 people still urgently need help with basic needs, including accommodation, health care, water, sanitation and food. The increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes in this region has been attributed to climate change, and has been long known and anticipated according to the communication. Allegedly, 95% of Providencia's infrastructure, houses and the only health center on the island were destroyed during the hurricanes, and many people were displaced.
The post-disaster reconstruction efforts do not take into account the aspirations and recommendations of the Raizal people and their authorities, leading to deficient housing that ignores the Raizal’s way of life and customs, and the climatic conditions on the islands. The newly built homes are insufficiently adapted to future climate risks (e.g. adequate roof fixtures) leading to serious risk of rendering people homeless and causing death or injuries when the next hurricane hits. The Government has allegedly not improved the building code of the islands, nor ensured that infrastructure, especially health infrastructure, could withstand severe climatic events. The system of water collection for newly built homes was also insufficient. Houses in Providencia and Santa Catalina traditionally have systems of gutters and underground cisterns, used to collect rainwater and store it in tank with limited risk of being affected or destroyed by storms and lighter hurricanes. However, newly rebuilt housing lacked those essential cisterns, making the Raizal indigenous people dependent on external water supply, limiting their resilience to climatic events and contradicting the Raizal tradition of living in a self-sufficient in harmony with nature. Similar problems exist in relation to the ability to return to climate-resilient and self-sufficient ways of food production on the islands.
In September 2022, the Colombian Constitutional Court issued a judgment (T-333 of 2022) determining that fundamental rights to decent housing, drinking water, basic sanitation, health and a healthy environment of the Raizal people were not sufficiently guaranteed in the post-disaster reconstruction process. Amongst others, the Constitutional Court ordered the Government to ensure that reconstruction efforts are consistent with the Raizal’s cultural identity and strengthens the resilience of the islands in the face of the effects of climate change.
The UN Special Rapporteurs express concern that, to date, insufficient measures are taken to guarantee the Raizal’s way of life and to protect people from extreme weather events. The Raizal people have not received habitable, safe and culturally appropriate housing, nor adequate and non-discriminatory compensation for losses suffered. The Special Rapporteurs emphasise that failure to prevent the impairment of human rights caused by climate change, or refraining from mobilizing maximum of available resources to this effect, could constitute a violation of States’ human rights obligations under the ICESCR, and to take action to address the effects of climate change.
Amongst relevant rights and instruments cited in support of the communication – in a separate Annex – are Articles 11, 12 and 15 ICESCR, pertaining to the right to adequate standards of living, including housing, the right to health, and right to culture; Article 17 and 27 ICCPR on the right to privacy, family and the home and right to culture of minorities; the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement; and UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and Environment.
On January 13, 2023, the Colombian government responded to the UN Special Procedures’ requests for further information through a document of over 100 pages detailing how the Government approached the reconstruction process, and which legislative frameworks and processes are in place to safeguard indigenous peoples’ rights, including cultural rights. It is aware that ‘climate change deepens inequalities, compromises food security and sovereignty and aggravates public health conditions’, including through increasingly severe weather events. It also aware of ‘the need to maintain policies that increasingly make it possible to close the historical gaps of less favored populations and that put human dignity as central axis of society’.","Post-disaster recovery for the Indigenous Raizal people after hurricanes Eta and Iota in Colombia, including through reconstruction of safe, culturally appropriate and climate-resilient housing","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221115_AL-PAK-72022_na-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230113_AL-PAK-72022_reply-2.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230113_AL-PAK-72022_reply.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/communication-to-the-government-of-colombia-about-the-humanitarian-and-environmental-crisis-suffered-by-the-afro-descendant-raizal-people

Communication to Pakistan concerning the ongoing forced evictions and home demolitions along Karachi’s waterways (nullahs),2022,AL PAK 7/2022,Pending,,"United Nations, UN Special Procedures, United Nations Special Rapporteurs","International Law, CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women), International Law, ICESCR (International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), International Law, ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), International Law, UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-Based Evictions and Displacement, International Law, UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, International Law, UN Guiding Principles on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights","On December 22, 2022, five UN Special Rapporteurs on the right to adequate housing, the right to health, rights of internally displaced persons, extreme poverty, discrimination against women and girls, issued a communication to Pakistan concerning the ongoing forced evictions and home demolitions along Karachi’s waterways (nullahs), against the backdrop of the severely negative impacts and destitution caused by the unusually heavy monsoon rains, and devastating seasonal floods of 2020 and 2022.
The evictions allegedly take place in the context of Pakistan’s climate change adaptation strategy, including implementation of a Supreme Court order that instructed the National Disaster Management Authority to remove all (informal) encroachments in and around the nullahs, due to their increased risk of flooding. Despite the Court’s ruling that people affected by the removal were to be rehabilitated, the evictions and home demolitions are allegedly carried out without consultation with the affected people and in the absence of a rehabilitation plan, and with disparate and inadequate compensation. The communication describes situations of homelessness, displacement, serious destitution, and inadequate living situations dangerous to health (e.g. overcrowding, lack of walls, rats, mosquitos and pest infestations, vector-borne and water-borne disease). It also describes how evictions and demolitions lead to loss of livelihoods for many, including especially women, as small businesses are run from their homes (e.g. tailoring).
Whilst understanding the 'enormity' of the challenges facing Pakistan in the wake of catastrophic floodings, and that Pakistan has been only modestly responsible for causing climate change, the communication recalls UN human rights bodies’ previous guidance on rights-based climate adaptation, supporting that priority should be given to adaptation measures that preserve existing communities, even for those living on or near waterways and shorelines. States must consult with residents to identify the measures needed for their protection, including the possibility to remain ‘in situ’; ‘resettlement and relocation should only be considered when strictly necessitated by the unsustainability of maintaining human settlements in at-risk zones’.
The situation described in the communication violate international human rights law, including the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, housing, water and sanitation, as well as adequate access to health care services. Relevant legal provisions - set out in an Annex to the communication – that govern the situation, include: Articles 6 and 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), pertaining to the right to life (with dignity) and right to non-interference with privacy, family and the home; Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), on the right to adequate housing, including as interpreted in CESCR General Comment No. 4 on the right to housing, and CESCR General Comment No 7 on forced evictions; and Article 12 ICESCR on the right to physical and mental health. Especially the right to housing includes a ‘right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity', with 'security of tenure, availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, affordability, habitability, accessibility, location and cultural adequacy'. An adequate house 'must protect inhabitants from cold, damp, heat, rain, wind or other threats to health, structural hazards, and disease vectors'. Other international legal guidance documents relevant to understanding the legal content of the right to housing, as related to evictions in a context of climate adaptation, include the UN Guiding Principles on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, and the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-based Evictions and Displacement. The latter spells out criteria for urban or rural planning and development planning, including in terms of ensuring rights-based information, consultation and participation. It stresses that displacement must be minimized, and that ‘eviction impact assessment’ should include exploring alternatives and strategies for minimizing harm to people and communities. In this sense, it is ‘essential that the full scope of all the environmental risks faced by informal settlements be assessed, drawing on the knowledge of inhabitants or experts hired on their behalf, since they are more familiar with the environment in which they live and have often adopted risk management practices'. Any 'immediate and effective disaster risk management measures' taken in at-risk areas, should be tailored to suit the specific needs of the community. The communication further acknowledges the specific rights of and obligations towards women in this respect, as clarified, inter alia, In CEDAW General Comment No. 37 on gender-related dimensions of disaster risk reduction in a changing climate.","Ongoing forced evictions and home demolitions along Karachi’s waterways, despite devastating impacts of unusually heavy monsoons and flooding, allegedly as part of Pakistan’s climate adaptation strategies.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221222_AL-PAK-72022_na-1.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/communication-to-pakistan-concerning-the-ongoing-forced-evictions-and-home-demolitions-along-karachis-waterways-nullahs

They are all indigenous inhabitants of Boigu, Poruma, Warraber and Masig, four small, low-lying islands in Australia’s Torres Strait region. The Islanders claimed that changes in weather patterns have direct harmful consequences on their livelihood, their culture and traditional way of life. The Islanders indicated that severe flooding caused by the tidal surge in recent years has destroyed family graves and left human remains scattered across their islands. They argued that maintaining ancestral graveyards and visiting and communicating with deceased relatives are at the heart of their cultures. In addition, the most important ceremonies, such as coming-of-age and initiation ceremonies, are only culturally meaningful if performed in the community's native lands. The Islanders also argued that changes in climate with heavy rainfall and storms have degraded the land and trees and have consequently reduced the amount of food available from traditional fishing and farming. On Masig Island, for example, the rising sea level has caused saltwater to seep into the soil and coconut trees to become diseased, subsequently killing off the fruit, and its coconut water, which are part of the Islanders’ traditional diet.",Whether Australia violated the human rights of low-lying islanders through failure to act on climate change,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2019/20190513_CCPRC135D36242019_press-release.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220923_CCPRC135D36242019_decision.docx, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2019/20190513_CCPRC135D36242019_complaint.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/petition-of-torres-strait-islanders-to-the-united-nations-human-rights-committee-alleging-violations-stemming-from-australias-inaction-on-climate-change

Rights of Indigenous People in Addressing Climate-Forced Displacement,2020,USA 16/2020,Pending,,"United Nations, UN Special Procedures, United Nations Special Rapporteurs","International Law, International Human Rights Law","Five U.S. Indian tribes submitted a complaint to the United Nations alleging that the U.S. government has violated their human rights in failing to address climate displacement. The complaint calls on several Special Rapporteurs to intervene and investigate, and to recommend that the U.S. government and the states of Alaska and Louisiana take steps to address displacement caused by climate change.
The Alaska Institute for Justice submitted the complaint on behalf of five tribes located in Louisiana and Alaska: Point-au-Chien Indian Tribe, Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of Biloxi-Citimacha-Cochtow Tribe, the Atakapa-Ishak Chawasha Tribe of the Grand Bayou Indian Village, and the Native Village of Kivalina. The complaint is directed to the Special Rapporteurs on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons, and the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, among others. The complainants assert that they are being forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands as a result of climate change, and that the U.S. government has failed to protect them despite knowing for decades that climate change threatens coastal communities. They further contend that the U.S. government's inaction has gone beyond basic negligence where the government has failed to engage, consult, acknowledge and promote the self-determination of the tribes as they develop adaptation strategies, including resettlement. The complaint also alleges that by failing to federally recognize the named Louisiana tribes, the U.S. government is further hamstringing efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.
The complaint asks the Special Rapporteurs to recommend that the U.S. government recognize the self-determination and inherent sovereignty of all the tribes; grant federal recognition to those that have not yet received it; and take certain steps to protect the tribes' land and cultural heritage, among other things. The complaint further asks the Special Rapporteurs to recommend that the Louisiana state government allocate funding to the named Louisiana tribes to respond to the humanitarian crisis caused by climate change; require the oil and gas industry to give advanced notice of their intent to conduct operations that may pose a risk to tribal cultural heritage, land, and waters; and hold oil and gas corporations responsible for damages caused to the Louisiana coast, among other things. The complaint also seeks a recommendation that the Alaska state government allocate funding to implement the tribal-led relocation process for Kivalina, and that all three governments develop relocation institutional frameworks.
The complainants' claims arise out of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the Pinheiro Principles on Housing and Property Restitution, and the Peninsula Principles on human rights that must be enforced when people are forcibly displaced because of climate change. The complaint also cites the right to self-determination of all peoples, the Charter of the UN, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, and Article 3 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
In September 2020, ten UN Special Rapporteurs, on cultural rights, environment, food, housing, indigenous peoples, internally displaced persons, poverty, racism, water and sanitation, jointly communicated the case the U.S. government, detailing the allegations and sought clarification on the measures taken by the government, and included a reference annex on international human rights law. The Rapporteurs refer to the applicability of Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), including right to food, water and housing; Article 12 ICESCR on the right to health; Article 15 ICESCR on cultural rights, and related civil and political rights, including likely Article 27 ICCPR; and the UN Convention on Racial Discrimination (CERD), along with several non-binding human rights instruments, such as the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the IASC Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons, the United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-based Evictions and Displacement, and UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).  The rapporteurs note that whilst the USA is not bound to the ICESCR, it cannot against ‘the object and purpose’ of this instrument because it signed the treaty.
To date, the government of the USA did not respond to this particular communication.
On November 30, 2022, during the White House Tribal Nations Summit, the Biden administration announced a $115 million commitment to the Voluntary Community-Driven Relocation Program, administered by the Department of the Interior, “to assist Tribal communities severely impacted by climate-related environmental threats.” This commitment will be allocated among “11 severely impacted Tribes to advance relocation efforts and adaptation planning,” in the form of relocation ($75 million) and planning ($40 million) grants. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law commits $130 for community relocation and $86 million for Tribal climate resilience and adaptation projects. It does not appear that any of the tribes that were party to the U.N. complaint received funding via the commitment announced in November.","U.S. tribes filed human rights complaint with UN, alleging U.S. government has failed to address climate-caused displacement.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200116_USA-162020_complaint-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200915_USA-162020_na-1.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/rights-of-indigenous-people-in-addressing-climate-forced-displacement

It seeks to recognize the Rio Doce River Basin as a subject of rights and hold the Federal Government and the State of Minas Gerais responsible for omissions in disaster prevention measures. The disaster contaminated the Rio Doce with 62 million cubic meters of iron ore sludge, causing damage to its ecosystem and its riverside populations. The plaintiff argues that the National Climate Change Policy (PNMC) and the National Civil Protection and Defense Policy (Law 12.608/2012) were not complied with, which actively contributed to the socio-environmental disaster. It claims that the PNMC obliges the state to make economic and social development compatible with the protection of the climate system, and that the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (PNA) pointed out flaws in the implementation of the PNMC, especially with regard to the failure to establish a national register of municipalities with areas susceptible to disasters and to draw up a State Civil Protection and Defense Plan.

Communication to France about the continued development of mega-basin projects,2023,JAL FRA 5/2023,Pending,,"United Nations, UN Special Procedures, United Nations Special Rapporteurs","International Law, ICESCR (International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), International Law, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Law, UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment","On May 18, 2023, the UN Special Procedures on the right to food, climate change, environment, freedom of assembly, human rights defenders and water and sanitation, issued a communication to France expressing their deep concern about the continued development of mega-basin projects in France, including especially for agricultural use. It considers that mega-basin projects may lead to violations of the right to environment and right to food due to difficulties for food production in regions that are heavily reliant on irrigation or with limited access to water resources. Such projects may have negative consequences by limiting livelihoods and productivity of small farmers who are already suffering economic difficulties linked to COVID-19, climate change and other constraints.
Mega-basin projects would mostly benefit a few large-scale agricultural industries, rather than the vast majority of smaller farmers in France, and encourage monoculture farming that requires both vast amounts of water and chemicals. Such farming practices may also lead to the production of crops for exportation mostly, adding to overall environmental costs of food production. Faced with climate change and the increased frequency, intensity and duration of droughts, these types of farming practices and related mega-basin projects would not be sustainable in the long run. The communication points to the ‘short-term profitability of the mega-basins’. Climate change poses several additional challenges to the sustainability of mega-basins projects from a perspective of human rights, notably: the impact of climate change on overall water needs across France;  the fact that storing water behind mega-dams could lead to severe evaporation of water resources; and, under pressure of heat and light the basins may be prone to formation of harmful algae and bacteria. There have been some studies conducted, but these did not detail the effects of climate change on the basis sufficiently.
The UN Special Procedures share the concerns expressed by farmers, peasants and experts that mega-basins are at odds with sustainable agricultural systems, especially in light of climate change impacts: ‘living soils capable of filtering water would allow agriculture to face the climate crisis and increasing water scarcity’, and as such mega-basins are an ‘example of poor adaptation to climate change’. To guarantee the right to food, ‘funding related to water in agriculture must be massively redirected towards the support and development of practices allowing water to be retained in the soil (e.g. agroecological practices such as plant covers, hedges, permanent meadows, peasant seeds, grassy strips)’, conserving water resources and protecting water quality.
The annex to the communication outlines the most important UN Charter-based and UN treaty-based provisions governing the right to food: Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and further notes the relevance of the UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and Environment (2012) and Human Rights Council resolution 50/9 of 2022, which recognizes that climate change affects the realization of the right to food. The communication asks the government to provide more information ‘on existing mechanisms to involve French farmers and the organizations they represent in the consultation, mediation and decision-making process regarding mega-basin projects and ensure that their interests and concerns are taken into account’
The communication also pays considerable attention to facts and complaints related to the rights of environmental human rights defenders during peaceful protests and manifestations, and in terms of criminalisation and access to justice for people protesting against the basins.
On September 15, 2023, France responded to the communication and the various requests for information. In its response, it mostly emphasizes the questions and issues related to the human rights defenders and protests, but also outlines in some detail which (legislative) frameworks and principles cover climate adaptation action in the agricultural sector, and how public participation may take place in this respect. The response does not include a substantive reaction on how public participation has occurred in response to the contested basins, or why the basins are pursued as part of France’s ‘range of solutions’ to effectively adapt to climate change as related to ‘agriculture and biodiversity’ or ensure ‘food sovereignty as a strategic issue for the nation’.","France’s continued development of mega-basin projects in a context of climate change, and their impacts on the rights to environment, food and water, including the rights of smaller farmers.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230518_JAL-FRA-52023_na-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230915_JAL-FRA-52023_reply-1.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/communication-to-france-about-the-continued-development-of-mega-basin-projects
Communications to Australia and three Australian companies concerning the fossil fuel activities of Woodside Energy,2022,"AL AUS 3/2022,  JAL OTH 91/2022, JAL OTH 92/2022, JAL OTH 93/2022",Pending,,"United Nations, UN Special Procedures, United Nations Special Rapporteurs","International Law, ICESCR (International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), International Law, ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), International Law, UN Declaration on Indigenous Peoples Rights, International Law, UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment, International Law, UN Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights","On June 26 and/or June 27, 2023, six UN Special Procedures on climate change, business and human rights, cultural rights, environment, indigenous peoples and toxic wastes, jointly issued communications to Australia and three Australian companies. The communications concern the fossil fuel activities of Woodside Energy, Australia’s largest natural gas producer, allegedly causing damage to indigenous sacred rock art and songlines in Murujuga, and to the wider objective of meeting obligations under the Paris Agreement.
Specifically, the communication addresses the expansion of Woodside Energy’s gas infrastructure in the Burrup Peninsula as part of the $16.5bn Scarborough gas project and Pluto LNG facility. The Scarborough gas resource is estimated to contain 11.1 trillion cubic feet of dry gas, and it is destined for further development through offshore and onshore (LNG) facilities.  The communication also addresses BHP Petroleum, an Australian company partaking in the Scarborough Joint Venture, and Perdaman Group, a major fertilizer production company that plans to build a fertilizer plant nearby, using a portion of the gas produced by Woodside Energy. The Scarborough Gas Project has already attracted many domestic appeals, including requests for injunctions on grounds of national law. According to a 2021 study, the Scarborough gas project will cause an estimated 1.37 billion tonnes of cumulative emissions by 2055, and result in a substantial increase of Western Australia’s GHGs emissions.
In their communications, the UN Special Procedures draw special attention to the impact of the Scarborough project on the aboriginal rock art at the sacred Murujuga site, comprising over a million petroglyphs and rock art engravings of over 70,000 years old containing sacred songlines and stories. It is nominated for UNESCO world heritage listing. Several traditional custodians of Murujuga are concerned about damage to this cultural heritage, and claim they have already suffered loss of traditional livelihoods, traditional indigenous knowledge and spiritual relationship with the land, as well as displacement and ecological degradation.
The UN Special Procedures convey their ‘most serious concern’ about the alleged human rights and environmental impacts of the project, noting that ‘climate change is having a major impact on a wide range of human rights today, and could have a cataclysmic impact in the future unless ambitious actions are undertaken immediately’. Among the human rights threatened and violated are ‘the rights to life, health, food, water and sanitation, a healthy environment, an adequate standard of living, housing, property, self-determination and development’. There is a special concern about long-standing and irreversible effects on the cultural rights of indigenous peoples due to loss of cultural elements. The relevant legal instruments providing the legal framework in this regard (set out in an Annex) include the Paris Agreement, and its references to human rights and indigenous people’s rights in the preamble; Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on the right to life (with dignity), including in the context of environmental degradation and climate change caused by public and private actors; and Article 15 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) on the right to culture. The latter has been interpreted in CESCR General Comment No. 21 (2009) as including an obligation to respect and protect cultural heritage in all its forms, by preserving, developing, enriching and transmitting it, for benefit of future generations. Indigenous peoples ‘have the right to the conservation and protection of the environment’ and ‘the right to determine and develop priorities and strategies for […] the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired’. Other relevant documents for cultural and environmental cited include the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP); UNGA Resolution 76/300 on the Right to Clean, Health and Sustainable Environment; UN Principles on Human Rights and Environment; and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). According to the latter, States have a duty to protect against human rights abuses within their territory and/or jurisdiction by third parties, including business enterprises, whilst Woodside Energy, BHP and Perdaman’s bear human rights responsibility to respect rights and to provide for remedies when their activities have caused or contributed to adverse impacts. The UNGPs also underscore the need for a ‘due diligence process’ by companies to ‘identify, prevent, mitigate and account for’ human rights impacts.
On 21 November 2022, Australia responded substantively by explaining how it has been consulting different traditional owner representatives, in addition to those lodging the complaint with the UN bodies. More specifically, the government must account for the ‘variety of different viewpoints’ within the community, and its ‘decision-making requires respecting the representative structures that Indigenous peoples have chosen for themselves’.  The new Australian government acknowledges ‘the inadequacies of existing legislation in protecting cultural heritage’ and notes it commitment ‘to co-design a standalone piece of cultural heritage legislation’ in partnership with a coalition of 29 Indigenous peoples member organisations from across Australia. It also outlines ‘a number of interim measures in place to address matters raised in the joint communication’, and expresses willingness to update the Special Procedures on developments in the future: ‘Australia does not shy away from fair scrutiny of our own human rights record and is willing to participate in UN accountability mechanisms’.
In November 2022, Woodside Energy and BHP also responded in some detail. Amongst others, they outlined their policies and practices related to indigenous peoples rights under UNDRIP, business and human rights under the UNGPs, as well as their corporate climate targets – without however considering whether or how the latter may be human rights compliant.","Negative human rights impacts of (expanding) the Scarborough gas project and LNG facilities by Woodside Energy and BHP in Australia, especially on indigenous people’s rights due to damage to indigenous sacred art and songlines in Murujuga","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220922_AL-AUS-32022-JAL-OTH-912022-JAL-OTH-922022-JAL-OTH-932022_na-4.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220922_AL-AUS-32022-JAL-OTH-912022-JAL-OTH-922022-JAL-OTH-932022_na.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220922_AL-AUS-32022-JAL-OTH-912022-JAL-OTH-922022-JAL-OTH-932022_na-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220922_AL-AUS-32022-JAL-OTH-912022-JAL-OTH-922022-JAL-OTH-932022_na-2.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221121_AL-AUS-32022-JAL-OTH-912022-JAL-OTH-922022-JAL-OTH-932022_reply-3.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221121_AL-AUS-32022-JAL-OTH-912022-JAL-OTH-922022-JAL-OTH-932022_reply.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221121_AL-AUS-32022-JAL-OTH-912022-JAL-OTH-922022-JAL-OTH-932022_reply-1.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/communications-to-australia-and-three-australian-companies-concerning-the-fossil-fuel-activities-of-woodside-energy
