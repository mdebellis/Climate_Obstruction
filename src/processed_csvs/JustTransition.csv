This includes a structured plan to ensure the decommissioning of the fossil fuel-powered thermoelectric sector and adopting a process to rebuild state infrastructure. The causes of action include the catastrophic consequences of the climate crisis experienced by the state; the fact that its fossil fuel-powered thermoelectric sector is one of the least efficient in Brazil, responsible for significant environmental liabilities and a large stock of emissions; and the state’s commitment under the Proclima 2050 program, which falls short of the state's needs in terms of energy transition. It is argued that the thermoelectric sector structure in Rio Grande do Sul contributes to climate change, and the Proclima 2050 program fails to provide truly effective guidelines for a just energy transition, which is critical given the increasingly frequent extreme weather events in the region.
In the injunction, it is requested that:
(i) The State of Rio Grande do Sul be ordered to establish a participatory committee to develop a just energy transition plan, with diverse representation;
(ii) The committee operates based on scientific data, hiring specialized consultancy to assist in its functioning;
(iii) The plan formulated by the committee be presented within 180 days; and

ADI 7332 (Policy for “just energy transition” of the State of Santa Catarina),2022,Ação Direta de Inconstitucionalidade 7332,Pending,"Suits against governments, Just transition","Brazil, Federal District, Federal District Federal Court","Brazil, Federal Constitution, art. 225, Brazil, Paris Agreement (enacted by Decree 9073/2017), Brazil, Federal Constitution, art. 170, Brazil, National Environmental Policy (Federal Law 6 938/81), Brazil, National Climate Change Policy (Law No. 12187 of 2009)","On December 29, 2022, the political party Rede Sustentabilidade (Rede) filed a Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (ADI), with a request for injunctive relief, against the State Law 18,330/2022, which institutes the Policy for Just Energy Transition of the State of Santa Catarina. The case is supported by Instituto Internacional Arayara de Educação e Cultura (Instituto Internacional Arayara) as amicus curiae. Rede's action questions the constitutionality of State Law 18,330/2022, which refers to electricity generation and the need for a just energy transition in the state of Santa Catarina. However, the State Law allows the use of non-renewable sources through coal-fired thermoelectric plants, arguing that these are fundamental for maintaining energy security. The plaintiff argues that, in reality, the law is nothing more than a ""legislative façade"" to perpetuate the role of coal in the state's energy system. The law does not present guidelines for the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) or even the abatement of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from activities related to the coal production chain. There is also no deadline for abandoning the use of coal; on the contrary, it foresees the installation of new industrial complexes that will use this fossil fuel. Finally, the law establishes tax and credit incentives for the coal production chain, also without any time limit. The plaintiff argues that these incentives make it possible to indirectly fund the purchase of electricity derived from the burning of coal and fossil fuels. Considering that the State Policy for Just Energy Transition, in fact, serves to foster the use of coal and, consequently, an increase in GHG emissions, the plaintiff claims it violates the Federal Constitution and the Paris Agreement, as well as the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009). The petition mentions several international organizations and their agendas which plan to eliminate the use of fossil fuels - especially coal - to show that the policy is a setback compared to the rest of the world and contradictory to the concept of a just transition. The plaintiff points out that the use of coal for energy generation is responsible for socio-environmental disasters in the region, the worsening of climate change, and damage to the public health, especially for populations already suffering from socio-economic disadvantages. It also challenges the provision in article 42 of the Law that excludes liability for environmental damage in the case of use of resources from duly licensed activities. Finally, it argues that the membership of the Council responsible for implementing the policy violates the principles of participatory democracy and equality, as there is an unequal number of seats allocated to government and civil society organizations and its composition does not reflect the participation of actors involved in environmental and labor causes and the sustainable closure of mines.","Whether the Policy for Just Energy Transition of the State of Santa Catarina, which provides subsidies to coal, is unconstitutional.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221229_Acao-Direta-de-Inconstitucionalidade-7332_petition-1.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/adi-7332-policy-for-just-energy-transition-of-the-state-of-santa-catarina

The case is supported by Instituto Internacional Arayara de Educação e Cultura (Instituto Internacional Arayara) as amicus curiae. The case questions the constitutionality of articles 1 to 7 of Federal Law 14,299/2022, which establishes an economic subsidy to small-scale public service concessionaires and creates the Just Energy Transition Program (TEJ). The applicants claim that the articles extend the contracting of electricity generated by the Jorge Lacerda Thermoelectric Complex (CTJL) with subsidies from consumers for another 15 years from 2025, which includes the purchase of energy from the burning of coal and fossil fuels. Considering that the CTJL is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the southern region of Brazil, the applicants allege that there is a violation of the Federal Constitution and the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017), as well as the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009). They emphasize that the use of coal for energy generation is responsible for socio-environmental disasters in the region, exacerbation of climate change and damage to public health, especially in relation to populations that are already subject to socioeconomic disadvantages. They argue that the TEJ makes it possible to extend the operation of the CTJL until at least 2040. Further, the norm has not presented guidelines for the reduction of GHG by the Complex. On the contrary, the TEJ stated that there will be no abatement of carbon dioxide. Finally, the applicants argue that the composition established for the TEJ Council violates the principles of participatory democracy and equality, as there is no equalization of the number of seats allocated to government and civil society organizations and its composition does not reflect the participation of actors related to environmental and labor causes and the sustainable closure of mines. As a precautionary measure, the plaintiffs request that the Law is interpreted according to the Constitution, so that they are considered unconstitutional. Further, that the the subsidy established by the Law is suspended and declared unconstitutional, suspending the effects of articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Law. The plaintiffs request, as a final measure, that the Court (i) gives an interpretation in accordance with the Constitution to articles 1, 2 and 3, considering them unconstitutional and prohibited the granting of the subsidy under the terms of the Law and (ii) that articles 4 to 7 of Federal Law 14,299/2022 be declared unconstitutional.","Whether the Just Energy Transition Program, which provides subsidies to a coal generating complex, is unconstitutional.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220310_Acao-de-Descumprimento-de-Inconstitucionalidade-No.-7095_petition.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/adi-7095-complexo-termeletrico-jorge-lacerda
Communication to Thailand on forced evictions for climate mitigation measures,2022,AL THA 3/2022,Pending,"Suits against governments, Just transition","United Nations, UN Special Procedures, United Nations Special Rapporteurs","International Law, ICESCR (International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), International Law, UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-Based Evictions and Displacement, International Law, UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas","On December 1, 2022, eight UN Special Procedures on the right to adequate housing, climate change, environment, food, human rights defenders, minority issues, extreme poverty, and contemporary forms of racism, jointly issued a communication to Thailand expressing their deep concern about the (threat of) forced eviction of 14 Isan minority members (9 women, 5 men), who are also land-right defenders, from their lands and homes in the Sab Wai village. The eviction orders were issued in pursuit of climate mitigation action under forest conservation policies and legislation, without provision of alternative accommodation and productive land, nor adequate compensation.
According to information received, Thailand’s updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) set aims to reduce GHGs by 20% compared to ‘business as usual by 2030, when compared to 2005 as the baseline year, and to achieve carbon (CO2) neutrality by 2050, and net-zero by 2065. A key strategy for meeting these objectives is to enhance forestry carbon sinks, including by reforestation, and improved conservation. The Thai government has adopted a 20-Year National Strategy, aiming to increase the country’s forested area to 55 percent of the total Thai territory by 2037 and adopted a Forest Reclamation Policy of 2014.
A key complaint is that the chosen strategy for meeting NDC targets negatively impacts, and even criminalizes forest-dependent communities, including minority and indigenous peoples and small-scale farmers and those having traditionally lived in or near national parks. An important concern is that the policies criminalize any person or entity which ‘destroys’ protected forests, which could include those who traditionally live and farm in protected area.  Those concerned call the strategy a ‘false solution’ to the climate crisis, for it moves attention away from necessary energy sector reforms. Moreover, despite earlier commitments that the Forest Reclamation Policy would primarily target large-scale investors and developers, and ‘protect the poor, landless and those who had settled in an area before it was declared as protected’, the actual implementation of the forestry policy is problematic.
Based on the forestry laws and policies, 14 Isan minority community members of the Sab Wai village in Chaiyaphum Province, central northeastern Thailand, are threatened by forced eviction from the lands they lived and farmed on since the 1970s, as they were identified as ‘forest destroyers’ under the current legislation. Their village is located in Sai Thong National Park, which was established in their living area in 1992.
According to the UN Special Procedures, the evictions constitute violations of international human rights law, since the villagers are not provided with alternative accommodation or productive land, nor adequate compensation. Actions to mitigate adverse effects of climate change must take into account negative impacts on the human rights of forest dependent communities, including especially their right to adequate standard of living, including food and housing. This is closely tied to communities’ right to land as well. The UN Special Procedures reaffirm forest-dependent minorities and communities’ ‘right to land, including the right to have access to, sustainably use and manage land and forests’. They ask how the Thai government intends to protect this right through measures aimed at legal recognition of ‘land tenure rights, including customary land tenure rights not currently protected by law’.
The communication is based on Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), as further interpreted through CESCR General Comment No. 4 on the Right to Adequate Housing, CESCR General Comment No. 7 on forced evictions, and the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-Based Evictions and Displacement. The latter clarifies, amongst others, that ‘evictions can only take place in 'exceptional circumstances'; that they must be authorized by law, and ensure full and fair compensation and rehabilitation’. The communication also outlines how ‘eviction-impact assessments’ should be carried out to explore alternatives and minimization of harm that may result from an inevitable eviction. The UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas was also cited, in recognition that ‘peasants and other people working in rural areas have the right to contribute to the design and implementation of national and local climate change adaptation and mitigation policies’.
Case specific observations on possible human rights violations and requests for further information, highlight that the Thai government’s forestry and environment-related laws and regulations, and their implementation, have discriminatory effects on specific ethnic groups and indigenous peoples, and that the Isan group more generally is subject to ‘direct and indirect, multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination’. They also ask how forest-dependent communities were consulted or participated in ‘the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of mitigation measures affecting them’, and what the outcomes of ‘human rights impact assessments of climate change mitigation measures’ have been. Specifically, consultation with the Isan minority villagers from the Sab Wai village should explore ‘feasible alternatives to the evictions, including the possibility to remain in situ or the provision of alternative land and housing and adequate compensation, and the outcome of these consultations’.
The Permanent Mission of Thailand in Geneva acknowledged receipt of the communication, but no formal response on behalf of the Thai government is registered in the communications repository to date.","Thailand’s large-scale (re)forestation strategy to achieve GHG emission targets threatens the human rights of 14 forest-dependent Isan minority members in Sab Wai village, who are also land-right defenders",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20221201_AL-THA-32022_na.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/thailands-large-scale-reforestation-strategy-to-achieve-ghg-emission-targets-threatens-the-human-rights-of-14-forest-dependent-isan-minority-members-in-sab-wai-village-who-are-also-land-ri
