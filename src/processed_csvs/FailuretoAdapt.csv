In September 2016, property owners filed a class action suit seeking C$900 million in damages from the Ministry for the most recent flood events. Class members include ""all [legal persons] that owned real property and or had an ownership interest in real property situated on the shoreline of the Muskoka Lakes who suffered damages as a result of high water levels, flooding, and/or floating ice in March or April 2016.""
