Maia Filho v. Federal Environmental Agency (IBAMA),2009,Special Appeal 1000.731 - RO,Decided,"Suits against governments, Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems","Brazil, Superior Court of Justice","Brazil, National Environmental Policy Act (Law No. 6.938 of 1981)","The Superior Court of Justice upheld the Federal Environmental Agency's fine, issued in 1995, of the appellants for burning roughly 600 hectares of land to clear it for livestock grazing. The court concluded that the fine was valid under the National Environmental Policy Act (Law N° 6.938, 1981). One of the judges explained that this particular application of the 1981 Act's restrictions on burning for agricultural purposes was justified in part by the fact of climate change, which informs how the objectives of environmental protection established in the text and environmental norms of the Brazilian Constitution pertain.",Validity of fine imposed by Environmental Federal Agency for the burning of 600 hectares for grazing land,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2009/20090825_Special-Appeal-1000.731-RO_ruling-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2009/20090825_Special-Appeal-1000.731-RO_na-1.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/maia-filho-v-environmental-federal-agency-ibama

Plaintiffs allege that the federal government has failed to comply with its own action plans to prevent deforestation and mitigate and adapt to climate change, violating national law and fundamental rights. Plaintiffs assert that the government has failed to meet the Brazilian emissions targets set out in the Climate Change National Policy Act, a binding act passed by the Brazilian legislature. In order to meet these targets, the federal government issued a decree setting out specific action plans for preventing and controlling deforestation in various Brazilian biomes, as well as outlining sectoral plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation. A key part of this decree is the Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in Legal Amazon (PPCDAm). By failing to meet critical targets in the PPCDAm and emissions targets, plaintiffs allege that the government is violating fundamental rights and national law. Plaintiffs seek an order to compel the federal government to comply with its existing policies, to reforest an area equivalent to what was deforested beyond the statutory limit, and to allocate sufficient budgetary resources for this purpose.",Whether the Brazilian Constitution guarantees a fundamental right to a stable climate and whether the Brazilian government may be compelled to meet emission and deforestation reduction goals,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20201008_Acao-Civil-Publica-No-5048951-39.2020.4.04.7000_complaint-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20201008_Acao-Civil-Publica-No-5048951-39.2020.4.04.7000_complaint-2.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200924_Acao-Civil-Publica-No-5048951-39.2020.4.04.7000_na-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210816_Acao-Civil-Publica-No-5048951-39.2020.4.04.7000_appeal-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210820_Acao-Civil-Publica-No-5048951-39.2020.4.04.7000_decision-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210820_Acao-Civil-Publica-No-5048951-39.2020.4.04.7000_na-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20211207_Acao-Civil-Publica-No-5048951-39.2020.4.04.7000_judgment-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220329_Acao-Civil-Publica-No-5048951-39.2020.4.04.7000_na-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220722_Acao-Civil-Publica-No-5048951-39.2020.4.04.7000_na.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/institute-of-amazonian-studies-v-brazil

The party claims that the defendants have omitted the task of combating deforestation in the Amazon, failing to comply with the provisions of articles 23, items VI and VII, and 225, caput and §1, items VI and VII, of the Federal Constitution. It presents the growing deforestation of the biome, especially as of 2019, as evidence of the concerns.

As part of this proceeding, Costa Rica sought compensation for the loss of environmental goods and services the country sustained due to Nicaragua’s excavation of channels on its territory. Among the services for which Costa Rica sought compensation was the impaired ability of the excavated area to provide “gas regulation and air quality services, such as carbon sequestration.” On February 2, 2018, the ICJ ruled how much Nicaragua must compensate Costa Rica for the loss of environmental services. This followed a ruling on the merits from December 16, 2015 that established that Nicaragua’s activities were unlawful and violated Costa Rica's territorial sovereignty and navigational rights, as well as the Court's Order of 8 March 2011, and found that Costa Rica should be compensated for these unlawful activities.","How the ICJ awards a country compensation for lost environmental goods and services, including gas regulation and carbon sequestration, resulting from another country’s environment-damaging activities","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2015/20151216_I.C.J.-Reports-2011-2018_judgment.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2018/20180202_I.C.J.-Reports-2011-2018_judgment.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/certain-activities-carried-out-by-nicaragua-in-the-border-area-costa-rica-v-nicaragua

State ADI 0007238-31.2021.8.21.7000 (Eldorado do Sul Master Plan),2021,,Decided,"Suits against governments, Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems","Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul State Court","Brazil, Federal Constitution, art. 225, Brazil, Paris Agreement (enacted by Decree 9073/2017), Brazil, ILO Convention 169 (enacted by Decree 5051/2004, Brazil, Federal Constitution, art. 231, Brazil, National Environmental Policy (Federal Law 6 938/81), Brazil, CONAMA Resolution 237/1997","This is a Direct Action of Unconstitutionality brought by the Attorney General of the State of Rio Grande do Sul against Municipal Law 4.968/2019 of Eldorado do Sul, which provides for urban policy and establishes the municipality's Urban and Environmental Development Master Plan. The plaintiff argues that the approval of the Plan by the City Council took place without popular participation during the legislative process, in violation of the constitutional right to participation, which makes it incompatible with the Constitution of the state of Rio Grande do Sul and the Federal Constitution. He argues that the law under discussion reduces environmental protection in the city, which reinforces the need for popular participation in the legislative process, as well as the need for a technical study to analyze its environmental impacts. It requests a preliminary injunction to suspend the validity of the contested law. On a final basis, it requests that Municipal Law 4.968/2019 be declared unconstitutional.
The Reporting Judge granted the injunction. He considered that the documentary evidence showed the lack of popular consultation. He considered that master plans are related to the population's quality of life, and that public discussion is essential. He pointed out that there had been no Environmental Impact Study or Neighborhood Impact Study, considering the National Environmental Policy - PNMA (Federal Law 6.938/1981) and CONAMA Resolution 237/1997.
The Association of Residents and Friends of Eldorado Park (AMAPE) requested to be admitted as amicus curiae in the case. AMAPE points out, among other issues, the importance of the climate debate in the case. It emphasized that climate should no longer be a peripheral issue in the lawsuit, since, alongside health protection, it is part of the core of the right to a balanced environment, forming part of the environmental existential minimum. He argued that the legislative plan to set up an industrial center in the area of Parque Eldorado (a district of the municipality), related to the opening of the Guaíba coal mine, goes against the need to expand renewable energy sources in order to preserve the planet's climate. He stressed that coal mining should be stopped in order to protect the climate, the environment and health, as provided for in the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017). It also claimed that the indigenous community living near the region had not been consulted about the approved law, as required by Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO). Subsequently, AMAPE and other organizations' request for amicus curiae status was granted.
The special body of the Rio Grande do Sul Court of Justice upheld the request to declare Municipal Law 4.968/2022 unconstitutional, on the grounds that the requirements of reasonable community participation in the drafting of the rule and prior environmental studies on its impacts were not met, considering the climate issue when mentioning AMAPE's statement.
Subsequently, the Municipal Law in question was repealed, which is why the claim lost its object. It was therefore definitively dismissed.","The Municipal Law 4.968/2019 of Eldorado Sul is unconstitutional for reducing environmental protection in the city, without popular participation during the legislative process, in violation of the state and federal constitutions, as well as with no environmental or neighborhood impact study that analyzed the possible negative effects on the environment.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20211210_21406_decision.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210409_21406_petition.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210323_21406_ruling.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210122_21406_petition.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/state-adi-0007238-3120218217000-eldorado-do-sul-master-plan

Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office and Public Prosecutor’s Office of the State of Paraná vs. Federal Environment Agency (IBAMA) and Environment Agency of the State of Paraná (IAT),2020,ACP nº 5023277-59.2020.4.04.7000,Pending,"Suits against governments, Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems","Brazil, Paraná (PR), Paraná Federal Court","Brazil, Atlantic Forest Protection Law (Law 11 428/06), Brazil, Atlantic Forest Law, Brazil, Forest Code (Law 12 651/2012), Brazil, National Climate Change Policy (Law No. 12187 of 2009)","On May 11, 2020, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF) and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Paraná (MPPR), filed a public civil action (environmental class-action) against the Federal Environment Agency (IBAMA) and the Environment Agency of the State of Paraná (IAT). The plaintiffs argue that Order 4.410/2020, issued by the Minister of the Environment, changed the previous understanding on the prevalence of the Atlantic Forest Law (Federal Law 11.428/2006) over the Forest Code (Federal Law 12.651/2012). The previous understanding considered the Atlantic Forest Law specialty in regulating this biome. The plaintiffs argue that the new understanding to apply the Forest Code, which is a less protective general rule, would allow the consolidation of occupation of protected areas (APP) illegally deforested (until July 22, 2008). They emphasize the need for the provisions of the Atlantic Forest Law to prevail due to the specialty and greater protection afforded to the biome. They highlight the importance of the biome and the contribution of its deforestation to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, arguing that the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC – Federal Law 12.187/2009) provides for preservation of biomes considered to be National Heritage, such as the Atlantic Forest. As a preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs request a series of administrative measures to prevent the cancellation of environmental infraction notices issued by the state of Paraná in the event of unauthorized suppression, cutting and/or use of remaining Atlantic Forest vegetation, and that the state environmental agency (IAT) refrain from approving documents that consolidate occupation in protected areas (APP) on properties in the Atlantic Forest with suppressed vegetation. In the final instance, they request that the injunctions be confirmed and that the IAT refrain from granting environmental licenses in favor of activities in APPs in the Atlantic Forest in disagreement with the special legislation.
In their defense, IBAMA and IAT argued that there is no antinomy between the Atlantic Forest Law and the Forest Code, claiming that the Forest Code created an exceptional regime to govern deforested areas consolidated over time in a less rigorous manner, which is applicable to any biome. Both requested that the initial claims be dismissed.
The lower court granted the preliminary injunction requested by the plaintiffs. It considered the special nature of the Atlantic Forest Law, which seeks stricter legal protection for the biome.  Based on the principles of prevention and precaution, the judge held that the application of the Forest Code's provisions in the Atlantic Forest biome could result in serious damage to the environment.
The decision was later overturned by the Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Justice (STJ), who ruled that this decision was damaging to the public economy and could cause irreversible damage to the public purse.

It states that deforestation causes irreparable damage to the Amazon Rainforest and affects the rights and way of life of the traditional extractivist community, which is based on the sustainable exploitation of natural resources. The action emphasizes that the Chico Mendes Extraction Reserve (RESEx) is an instrument of social justice and a vehicle for forest protection. It claims that the advance of deforestation has occurred due to the weakening of public policies, land invasion, road construction, density of access roads, and fires in the region, among other reasons. According to the plaintiff, beginning in 2019, there has been a drastic increase in deforestation. The RESEx Utilization Plan states that deforestation in areas with rubber plantations cannot exceed 10% of the area, and the action claims that this limit has been exceeded in approximately half of those areas. The IEA emphasizes that RESEx has a strategic role in providing environmental services to the inhabitants of the Acre River basin due to the supply of water. It also highlights the deforestation reduction targets for the Legal Amazon region in the Amazon Deforestation Prevention and Control Plan (PPCDAm) foreseen in Federal Law 12.187/2009 (National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC)), which, according to the IEA, are not being met. It points out that, as the Federal Union, IBAMA and ICMBio are not fulfilling their duty of management and control and are contributing to the damage to the RESEx and the community. It emphasizes the vital role of the forest in the carbon cycle and that approximately three million tons of carbon were released into the atmosphere due to illegal deforestation in the RESEx. The IEA argues that there is a need for full environmental reparation in addition to the obligation to restore the forest and argues that future studies should be done to calculate the compensation for associated damages, such as climate damage. It emphasizes the vulnerable situation of the community, which justifies the payment of compensation for collective moral damage. It also argues that there is a need to prepare a Forest Restoration and Deforestation Control Plan for the region. Finally, among the other claims, the author requests: (i) payment of compensation for the material damage caused to the environment in the amount of at least R$ 183,817,104.00; (ii) payment of compensation for collective moral damage in the minimum amount of R$ 100,000,000.00; and (iii) immediate forest restoration of the entire area deforested above the established limit, to be carried out according to a Forest Restoration and Deforestation Control Plan.

"Federal Public Ministry, SOS Mata Atlântica and ABRAMPA v. Federal Union (MMA Order 4.410/2020 and special legislation for the Atlantic Forest)",2020,ACP nº 1026950-48.2020.4.01.3400,Decided,"Suits against governments, Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems",,"Brazil, Order 4, Brazil, 410/2020 MMA, Brazil, Atlantic Forest Protection Law (Law 11 428/06), Brazil, Forest Code (Law 12 651/2012)","On May 6, 2020, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF) and two NGOs, SOS Mata Atlântica and ABRAMPA, filed a public civil action (environmental class-action) against the Federal Government, seeking a declaration of nullity of Order 4.410/2020 issued by the Ministry of the Environment (MMA). The plaintiffs claim that the contested Order changed the understanding consolidated in the previous MMA Order 64.773/2017 on the specialty and prevalence of the Atlantic Forest Law (Federal Law 11.428/2006) over the Forest Code (Federal Law 12.651/2012) concerning the protection of the Atlantic Forest biome. It so happens that Order 4.410/2020 imposed guidance on federal public entities to apply the Forest Code, which is a less protective general rule, allowing the consolidation of occupation of protected areas (APP) illegally deforested (until July 22, 2008). The plaintiffs aim, among other things, to prevent the cancellation of several environmental infraction notices for deforestation and fires as a result of the possible consolidation of occupation of APP. They point out that the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the country is deforestation and changes in land use, and that special legislation, such as the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC – Federal Law 12.187/2009), establishes the duty to preserve, conserve and restore Brazil’s natural biomes such as the Atlantic Forest. Finally, they request, as an injunction, (i) the suspension of the effects of the contested Order 4.410/2021 and (ii) the reinstatement of the effects of MMA Order 64.773/2017. On the merits, they request the confirmation of the injunction with (i) a declaration that the Order 4.410/2021 is null and void and (ii) an order that the Federal Government refrain from issuing another normative act denying the prevalence of the special legislation of the Atlantic Forest over the Forest Code.
In its defense, the Federal Government argued that the action had lost its object, due to the spontaneous revocation of Order 4.410/2020, and pointed out that the matter had been brought before the Federal Supreme Court (STF), and that it was up to that Court to determine the best interpretation of the issue. Accordingly, it requested that the case be dismissed.
In a judgment based on procedural grounds, the court ruled that the plaintiffs had no interest in acting and dismissed the case, without resolving the merits. This decision was upheld on appeal and the case was dismissed.",Whether a Federal Order that changes the regime for protected areas in the Atlantic Forest is legal and in accordance with the National Policy on Climate Change.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220418_ACP-no-1026950-48.2020.4.01.3400_petition-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210830_ACP-no-1026950-48.2020.4.01.3400_judgment-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200801_ACP-no-1026950-48.2020.4.01.3400_decision-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200805_ACP-no-1026950-48.2020.4.01.3400_decision-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200506_ACP-no-1026950-48.2020.4.01.3400_petition-1.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/federal-public-ministry-sos-mata-atlantica-and-abrampa-v-federal-union-mma-order-4410-2020-and-special-legislation-for-the-atlantic-forest

Union of India,2016,,Decided,"Suits against governments, Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems","India, National Green Tribunal",,"In 2016, the petitioner, a senior environmental lawyer, filed a case before the NGT. The case relates to large scale and uncontrolled forest fires ravaging the States of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh thereby undermining the ecological sustainability of an already endangered biological zone. Emissions released by forest fires include carbon dioxide CO2, carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4), organic aerosols and black carbon, non-methane organic compounds, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and Sulphur dioxide (SO2). These emissions affect the efficiency of both atmospheric and surface absorption of solar energy, with resultant cooling and or warming effects. Forest fires have a devastating effect on the glaciers of Uttarakhand, which are the life line of major north Indian rivers, have been covered by ‘black carbon’ causing them to melt faster. The respondents, States of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, contended that the year 2016 saw extremely low rainfall thereby causing a serious moisture deficit in the soil and in the forest areas, thereby making conditions conducive to the occurrence and spread of forest fires.","Emissions from forest fires contribute to climate change, and the need to develop forest fire management plans.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2017/20170803_17016_judgment.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/rajiv-dutta-v-union-of-india

This petition was in reference the judgment of the Supreme Court dated 19th April, 2021 wherein the Supreme Court had ordered that a large part of the territory not be used for overhead transmission lines, gave instructions to convert to underground power lines within a year and appointed a committee to determine whether laying high voltage underground power lines would be feasible. The Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change, the Ministry of Power, and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (‘MNRE’) requested a modification of the judgement dated 19th April, 2021, on the grounds that the implementation of the said judgment would cause adverse implications for the power sector and India’s International commitment for energy transition and fulfilment of promise under the Paris agreement signed by India in 2015 under the United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate Change[UNFCC]. In the present case the Apex Court had to decide two major issues i.e. modification of the directions issued under the earlier judgment dated 19th April, 2019 and to balance the preservation of Great Indian Bustard and India’s commitment to control climate change through just transition [ shifting from energy from fossil fuels to renewable energy]. The Apex court reviewed the factors causing threats to Great Indian Bustards, the actions taken by the Government of India, specifically the programme ‘Habitat Improvement and Conservation breeding of Great Indian Bustard’ launched in 2016 and other measures. The Court also discussed the impacts of changing climate and India’s commitments and efforts to control it. It was observed that promotion of renewable energy sources is crucial for promoting social equity by ensuring access to clean and affordable energy for all segments of society and thus fostering inclusive growth and development across the nation. The Court emphasised on the duty on the part of the State under Article 48 A and fundamental duty of citizens under Article 51 A of the constitution of India as constitutional commitments to ensure protection of natural world and compassion for living creatures. Relating these duties to Articles 21 and 14 of the Indian Constitution, the Court declared that the right to clean environment and right against the adverse effects of climate change has its source in Article 21 which recognises the right to life and personal liberty and article 14 which indicates equality before law and equal protection of law. Thus, justifying the actions of the State, the court dealt with intersection between climate change and human rights as well as a novel issue of intricate interface between the conservation of an endangered species, such as the Great Indian Bustard and the imperative of protecting against the climate change.",Balancing the interplay between safeguarding biodiversity by preservation of the Great Indian Bustard and mitigating the impacts of climate change through interpretation of Indian Constitutional Provisions and other legal framework in India and international commitments.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2024/20240321_67806_judgment.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/mk-ranjitsinh-ors-v-union-of-india-ors

Comunidad aborigen de Santuario de Tres Pozos et al v. Jujuy Province,2023,Case SJ-19962/2023,Pending,"Suits against governments, Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems",,"Argentina, NDC, Argentina, Constitution","On July 12, 2023, several Indigenous Communities and an ENGO (Fundación Ambiente y Recursos Naturales – FARN) filed a claim before the Superior Tribunal of Justice of the Jujuy Province challenging the constitutionality of the new provincial constitution. The claim involved several arguments, some of them are environmental and one is climatic. Among others, the plaintiffs alleged the breach of the right of the Indigenous Communities to free, prior and informed consent, the right to access information, the right of human rights defenders in environmental matters, the non-regression principle as contained in the Escazú Agreement and the infringement of international and national environmental provisions.
Regarding this last argument and particularly climate concerns, the plaintiffs observed that Jujuy is home to (high-Andean) wetlands (salt pans, salt flats, lagoons, meadows) that provide a range of key environmental benefits, such as climate mitigation and adaptation, and that those ecosystems are threatened by the impacts of climate change and human activities with high impact, including the increasing lithium mining. In this context, the plaintiffs argued, there is a need to develop a sound protection of these ecosystems that includes an intergenerational approach and the rights of the future generation. This protection is, however, according to the plaintiffs, disregarded by the new constitutional text that regulates these ecosystems mainly as objects of exploitation and production. In this sense, the new constitutional text would not engage with the National Climate Change Act, nor with the NDC or the National Long-Term Strategy. Particularly, the provincial constitutional text would breach the principle of priority introduced by the National Climate Change Act and that establishes that adaptation and mitigation policies must prioritize the needs of vulnerable groups in the context of climate change (Art. 4.c Act 27.520).","Whether a provincial constitution is unconstitutional due to climate, indigenous and environmental concerns.",https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230712_Case-SJ-199622023_petition-1.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/comunidad-aborigen-de-santuario-de-tres-pozos-et-al-v-jujuy-province

The party highlights the high percentage of deforestation in the Cerrado and the high number of fires monitored by INPE in 2021, which is occurring alongside the advance of the agricultural and livestock frontier in the biome. It highlights the importance of the Cerrado in terms of preserving biodiversity and social aspects, as indigenous populations, quilombolas, geraizeiras, ribeirinhas, babaçueiras and vazanteiras survive on the biome's resources. It also highlights its importance for water distribution in the country, as the Cerrado is responsible for the flow of important river basins. It also points out that the biome stores 13.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide and, if it continues to be destroyed, there will be greater greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, preventing the achievement of international climate targets set by Brazil in the Climate and Biodiversity Conventions.

The Resolution deals with the Program on Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles (PROCONVE), which, among its objectives, seeks to reduce the levels of pollutant emissions from motor vehicles in order to meet Air Quality Standards. The plaintiff organization points out that the extension established in the IN was the result of a request made by the defendant companies. It argues that the IN extends the permission to produce and sell vehicles that emit more greenhouse gases (GHG) and goes against the commitments to reduce emissions made by Brazil under the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017). In addition, it goes against the public authorities' duty to protect the environment, set out in Article 225 of the Federal Constitution, and the principles of prevention, precaution and prohibition of environmental setbacks. It also claims that the normative change generates environmental damage, to human health and to the climate system, insofar as it authorizes the unrestricted growth of the automotive fleet, characterized by the burning of fossil fuels, which is proven to be responsible for worsening the greenhouse effect. It argues that the effects of the climate crisis disproportionately affect the most socio-economically vulnerable populations. For these reasons, it requests, among other measures, in advance, (i) the suspension of the effects of IN 23/2021 and, on the merits, (ii) the declaration of nullity of said IN, (iii) the condemnation of the defendants for material damages to the environment and (iv) the condemnation of the defendants to pay compensation for collective damages.
In an administrative order, the court noted the participation of the Collective Law Institute (IDC) as an interested third party and informed that, in due course, it would consider the request for amicus curiae.
The court granted the request for injunctive relief and ordered the defendants to submit reports containing the number of vehicles produced between December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 that did not meet the emission limits of the PROCONVE L-7 phase and suspended the effects of IN 23/2021. In addition, it granted amicus curiae status and the Federal Public Defender's Office as an active litigation assistant.
In its defence, Toyota do Brasil Ltda. claimed that, although it had arequested IBAMA and CONAMA for a temporary authorization to end the manufacture of vehicles in accordance with the specifications of PROCONVE phase L-6, it had not made use of the time extension granted by IN 23/2021, since all the vehicles relating to this phase were completed in 2021. It sought recognition that the court chosen to file the lawsuit was inappropriate and that the company was not a party to the lawsuit. It defended the legality of IN 23/2021, as it had been widely discussed and issued by a competent body. It clarified that the IN only covered vehicles whose engines were already authorized for the PROCONVE L-6 phase, but which had not been finalized due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which rules out the existence of retrogression or environmental damage. It requested, on a preliminary basis, that the case be dismissed without a decision on the merits. In a final plea, it requested that the initial claims be dismissed.
In its response, Nissan argued that it was not a legitimate party to the lawsuit because it did not fall within the scope of IN 23/2021. It claimed that it did not extend the production of PROCONVE phase L-6 vehicles beyond the date established in the IN and that all vehicles produced by the defendant as of 2022 would already comply with the requirements of phase L-7 of the program. It argued that the IN is regular and argued that the company's responsibility for the alleged damage had not been proven. It also explained that its production activities are compatible with national and international climate targets and commitments. It requested that the company be recognized as an illegitimate party in the case and, in the alternative, that the claims be dismissed.
IBAMA also filed a defense. It raised the preliminaries of inadequacy of the chosen forum for the judicial relief sought. It argued for the legality and constitutionality of IN 23/2021, since the administrative act only extended the validity of some Licenses for the Use of Vehicle or Engine Configuration (LCVM) issued during PROCONVE's L-6 phase, totaling 5,398 vehicles manufactured during its coverage period. It clarifies that the IN stipulated that vehicle manufacturers and importers who had cars that had not been manufactured due to the lack of electronic components caused by the COVID-19 pandemic should inform IBAMA of the quantities affected by January 31, 2022, in order to complete their manufacture by March 31, 2022 and complete their marketing by June 30, 2022. The normative act stipulated that if the vehicles could not be assembled by the beginning of 2022, they could not be used and would be discarded. In this way, the IN set up a ""carry-over stock"" of vehicles to allow those that were already in the manufacturing process to enter the market, whose engines did not represent an increase in emissions beyond what was already foreseen for PROCONVE's L-6 phase and, therefore, environmental damage would not be configured. IBAMA requested that the action be dismissed without a decision on the merits and, in the alternative, that the claims be dismissed, with the revocation of the provisional injunction granted.
In its opposing brief, the Federal Government argued, preliminarily, that it was illegitimately liable to be sued and that the chosen via was inappropriate. It defended the validity and effectiveness of IN 23/2021, which was issued due to force majeure caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in order to avoid a greater financial crisis. It argued that the Union's civil liability was not established, that there was no material damage to the environment or collective moral damage and challenged the amount of compensation requested in the initial claim. It requested that the preliminary objections be accepted in order to extinguish the action without resolving the merits and, in the alternative, that the claims be dismissed.
Renault do Brasil S.A., in its defense, claimed that of the 5,398 units of vehicles whose manufacture had been completed in 2022 based on IN 23/2021, only 125 belonged to the brand. It claimed that, during 2021, Renault had produced other vehicles in advance that already complied with phase L-7 of PROCONVE. It clarified that the IN did not imply an increase in the circulating fleet of vehicles beyond what was planned for the L-6 phase of the program. It reiterated the arguments used by the other defendant car companies regarding the legality, validity and proportionality of the IN. It argued that the company's completion of production of 125 vehicles in accordance with phase L-6 of PROCONVE did not cause environmental damage. It requested that the claims made in the initial petition be dismissed. In the alternative, it requested that consideration be given to the fact that Renault produced and sold 125 vehicles based on IN 23/2021 (2.31% of existing vehicles covered by the IN) so that any liability of Renault for environmental damage or collective moral damage should be limited to this proportion.
The parties were called to comment on the evidence to be produced. On this occasion, the Institute of Collective Law (IDC), amicus curiae, filed a petition requesting that documents and studies submitted by the plaintiff be analyzed, also determining the reversal of the burden of proof required and that all the requests made in the initial petition be upheld, considering that IN 23/2021 is at odds with Brazilian efforts to reduce the impact of the climate crisis and should be clearly informed and justified. The merits have not yet been judged.","Whether the Normative Instruction (IN) 23/2021 should be annulled.

The lawsuit seeks the annulment of the state decree that created a state park overlapping with a quilombola territory. The case highlights environmental racism as a major factor behind the marginalization of the Quilombola Community of Bombas, which has been denied its territorial rights due to the supposed incompatibility of these rights with local biodiversity protection. This is because the community's territory overlaps with the Alto Ribeira Tourist State Park (PETAR). The plaintiffs argue that the Quilombola peoples of that region are protectors of nature and have a relationship of mutual dependence with it. They, therefore, request Quilombola territorial recognition, a land survey with the removal of any third parties, the revocation or invalidation of State Decree 32.283/1958 (only regarding its impact on the Quilombola territory), the titling of the Quilombola territory, and the construction of a road providing adequate access to the community.

"Bartoli, Jorge et al v. Santa Fe Province",2020,Case 21-01448358-3 // 21-02019565-4,Decided,"Suits against governments, Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems","Argentina, Civil and Commercial District Court Nº 11 (Rosario)","Argentina, Act 10.000 (Diffuse Interests Protection Act), Argentina, NDC","In 2020, a group of individuals and NGOs filed two similar claims against the Province of Santa Fe, challenging its management of fishing activities in the face of a critical lowering of the Paraná River levels. Together with a precautionary measure, the plaintiffs asked the judge to order the Province to elaborate an integral and participative Plan to protect the river basin’s aquatic fauna and fish resources. Although the claim made only a passing reference to climate change to highlight the increasing pressure that the aquatic fauna is suffering and will suffer due to climatic changes, the Public Prosecutor introduced a climate focus to the case. On May 31, 2021, the Public Prosecution Office intervened in the case as a party, supporting the plaintiffs’ stance and asking for new remedies from the judge. Among other arguments, the Prosecutor observed that the second Argentinean NDC had identified the “extraordinarily low water levels in the rivers” causing problems to “subsistence fishermen…” as a climate risk for the Santa Fe region and referred to the IPCC reports and the Paris Agreement to allege the need for public authorities to implement climate adaptation measures, including the need of livelihood diversification of vulnerable groups. According to the Prosecutor, in this case, this was connected to the effective functioning and implementation of two institutional mechanisms: the Provincial Reconversion Council and the Fishery Reconversion and Fishermen's Assistance Fund. The Prosecutor observed that these two mechanisms, which were not currently functioning, had been created with aims that ‘certainly constitute climate adaptation measures’ to protect vulnerable groups of fishermen in the region. In this sense, the Prosecutor maintained that their “implementation is an urgent tool for a satisfactory solution to the socio-environmental conflict suffered by the fishermen of Santa Fe and the ecosystem of the Paraná River, not only in terms of the current low water levels, but also those that will continue to occur due to climate change.”",Whether the fishing activities of Santa Fe considered the Parana River's lowering levels and fauna and fish.,"https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200514_Case-21-01448358-3-21-02019565-4_petition.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20200531_Case-21-01448358-3-21-02019565-4_reply.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230622_Case-21-01448358-3-21-02019565-4_judgment.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/bartoli-jorge-et-al-v-santa-fe-province
ADPF 755 (Federal environmental sanctioning process),2020,ADPF 755,Decided,"Suits against governments, Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems","Brazil, Federal District, Federal District Federal Court","Brazil, Federal Constitution, art. 225, Brazil, Federal Constitution, art. 5, Brazil, Paris Agreement (enacted by Decree 9073/2017), Brazil, Federal Constitution, art. 231, Brazil, National Environmental Policy (Federal Law 6 938/81), Brazil, Law 9.605/1998","This is an Argument for Failure to Comply with a Fundamental Precept (ADPF), with a request for a precautionary measure, filed by four political parties: the Brazilian Socialist Party  (PSB), the Workers Party (PT), the Socialism and Freedom Party (PSOL) and Network for Sustainability (REDE). The aim is to resume the federal environmental sanctioning process. The plaintiffs argue that the federal government has acted to dismantle and weaken the national environmental protection system. They highlight the increase in deforestation and fires in the Amazon and the Pantanal, also affecting indigenous lands, as well as the paralysis of the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm) and the delegitimization of data relating to these facts by the President of the Republic. They argue that the issuance of Federal Decree 9.760/2019 by the President of the Republic paralyzed the environmental sanctioning process, mainly due to the provision of the conciliation stage in the process and the impossibility of converting fines into environmental services. They point out that the conversion provided for in Federal Law 9.605/1998, which provides for criminal and administrative sanctions for conduct harmful to the environment, is an important institute for fulfilling Brazil's commitment to the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017). They allege that the cases awaiting conciliation hearings have been suspended, while the statute of limitations continues to run. The plaintiffs argue that the Federal Government could not have amended Federal Law 9.605/1998, introducing a new phase to the sanctioning process, by means of a decree, in addition to the fact that the normative instrument has several inconsistencies. They argue that paralyzing this system violates articles 225, 231 and 23, caput and items VI and VII, of the Federal Constitution, the principles related to due process of law and the precautionary principle. They request, as a precautionary measure: (i) the declaration of unconstitutionality of Federal Decree 9. 760/2019 and that the environmental sanctioning process be unblocked; (ii) alternatively, that the aforementioned decree be interpreted in accordance with the Constitution, in the terms requested; (iii) if it is understood in a different way to the previous requests, that the counting of the statute of limitations for the processes be suspended until the conciliation hearing takes place; (iv) that the implementation of the requested measures be monitored; (v) that the Federal Government be ordered to submit to the Court a plan for resuming the regular functioning of the environmental sanctioning process; and (vi) for the Federal Government to refrain from taking any further measures that hinder, make unfeasible or paralyze the regular progress of the federal environmental sanctioning process. In the final analysis, they request confirmation of the precautionary measures, with the declaration of unconstitutionality of the Federal Decree in question.","The return of the federal environment sanctioning process, amended by the Federal Decree 9.760/2019, the constitutionality of which is being questioned.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220328_ADPF-755_petition-1.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20201021_ADPF-755_petition-1.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/adpf-755-federal-environmental-sanctioning-process
Prosecutor’s Office of the State of Goiás v. State of Goiás (State public policy on air quality control),2021,ACP 5569834-31.2021.8.09.0051,Pending,"Suits against governments, Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems","Brazil, Goiás, Goiás State Court","Brazil, Federal Constitution, art. 225, Brazil, Paris Agreement (enacted by Decree 9073/2017), Brazil, National Environmental Policy (Federal Law 6 938/81), Brazil, CONAMA Resolution 237/1997, Brazil, CONAMA Resolution No. 01/86, Brazil, State Policy on Climate Change – PEMC (State Law 16.497/2009), Brazil, National Climate Change Policy (Law No. 12187 of 2009)","This is a Public Civil Action, with a request for an injunction, brought by the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Goiás (MPGO) against the state of Goiás. It seeks to compel the state to take the necessary measures to improve air quality and, consequently, safeguard the health of the population by implementing a public environmental policy for monitoring and controlling air pollution and climate change. The plaintiff claims that the regional government has failed to comply with public environmental control policies aimed at protecting air quality and the climate. It stresses the state's repeated inertia in combating climate change, controlling air pollution and monitoring vehicle pollution, evidenced by the lack of technical actions, such as implementing a network of air quality monitoring stations, carrying out an inventory of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mobile sources, as well as implementing Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Programs.
The Public Prosecution highlights the omission in the analysis of climate impacts in environmental licensing procedures in the state, claims that, in line with the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009), the State Policy on Climate Change - PEMC (State Law 16.497/2009) was instituted, but few public policies have been implemented. It also points out the lack of implementation of instruments to prevent atmospheric pollution and climate change, especially the Atmospheric Emissions Control Plan (PCEA) and the Vehicle Pollution Control Plan (PCPV). It highlights the inadequacy of the PCPV in the state of Goiás.
It outlines the risks of damage to human health and the environment caused by air pollution and noise pollution. It links air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels to the climate crisis. It requests, as an injunction, that the State of Goiás be ordered to adopt measures aimed at implementing Conama Resolutions 01/1993, 02/1993, 418/2009 and 491/2018, Federal Laws 8.723/1993, 9.503/1997 and 12.187/2009, the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017) and State Law 16.497/2009. On the merits, it requests that the State of Goiás be ordered, among other measures: (i) to implement public environmental policies to control pollution and combat climate change, by drawing up the PCEA, including a network to monitor air quality throughout the state, from both mobile and stationary sources of gas emissions; (ii) to implement a network to monitor air quality throughout the state;(iii) to update the PCPV; (iv) to draw up, implement and carry out the Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program (I/M) and the annual Environmental Vehicle Inspection Program for gas and noise emissions in motor vehicles; (v) to define and publish Administrative Regulations establishing (v.1) activities with significant GHG emissions for the purposes of environmental licensing and the requirement to submit a GHG Emission Inventory, (v.2) Term of Reference (TR) criteria for drawing up the Inventory and (v.3 ) technical criteria and standards for assessing environmental impacts on the micro and macroclimate in environmental licensing procedures in the state, as well as GHG mitigation and compensation instruments; (vi) to prove that all environmental licensing procedures in progress that have an Environmental Impact Study and respective Environmental Impact Report (EIA/RIMA) require an inventory of GHG emissions, as well as the obligation to present an assessment of environmental impacts on the micro and macroclimate in the TRs; and (vii) to draw up a State Inventory of GHG Emissions.
In response to the request for injunctive relief, the judge granted the preliminary injunction, ordering the immediate implementation of the violated normative provisions, considering that the failure of the government to comply with its legal and constitutional obligations would be enough to prove fumus boni juris, while the danger of damage would be characterized by the risk to collective health. In contrast, the state of Goiás filed an interlocutory appeal with suspensive effect, asking for the injunction to be overturned, indicating, in short, (i) the absolute nullity of the decision, since the federal court would be competent to deal with the case, and (ii) the lack of the necessary requirements for granting urgent relief.
In addition, the state of Goiás filed an opposition. The state argued that only the Executive Branch can determine the form and condition of implementation of environmental public policies, considering the financial resources available. It argued that the Public Prosecutor uses the judicial process to request the implementation of public policies, which is not the appropriate way and interferes with the principle of separation of Powers. It requested, among other things, a preliminary ruling: (i) a declaration of the court's lack of jurisdiction, since the subject matter of the lawsuit deals with the administrative competence of the Federal Union and the municipalities; (ii) the calling to account of the State Traffic Department (Detran/GO), the Goiás Infrastructure and Transport Agency (Goinfra), the Federal Union and the municipalities of Goiás; (iii) the suspension of the dispute for 365 days so that the parties can begin negotiations to establish objective parameters for the implementation of public policies; and (ii) the creation of a Working Group with professionals with knowledge in the areas subject to regulation. On the merits, among other issues, it requested that the injunction be dismissed and that the plaintiff's claims be declared unfounded. In the alternative, it asked that the limits on the reviewability of administrative acts by the Judiciary, the separation of powers and the federal pact be respected.
In the context of the interlocutory appeal 5245769-11.2022.8.09.0051, the Court of Justice issued a ruling in which it partially accepted the appeal filed by the state of Goiás. It held that it was not possible for the Court to examine the preliminary thesis of absolute incompetence of the Common State Court, as it had not been examined by the previous court. On the merits, it considered that the requirements for granting the injunction requested by the Public Prosecutor's Office had been met. He stressed that the installation of systems to control noise and air pollution emitted by motor vehicles in the state of Goiás has a normative basis for compliance, and recognized that they had not been effectively implemented, resulting in a violation of the constitutional duty to protect the environment. He stated that the aggravated decision merely ordered the appellant to comply with environmental laws. It held that the state had sufficient time to implement public policies, such as those aimed at monitoring and controlling air pollution and climate change and controlling noise pollution, which constituted an omission. It therefore dismissed the appeal.","Whether the State of Goiás is obligated to take measures to improve air quality and control climate change, and if so, to what extent.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220808_ACP-5569834-31.2021.8.09.0051_decision.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220429_ACP-5569834-31.2021.8.09.0051_reply.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2022/20220308_ACP-5569834-31.2021.8.09.0051_decision.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20211029_ACP-5569834-31.2021.8.09.0051_petition.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/prosecutors-office-of-the-state-of-goias-v-state-of-goias-state-public-policy-on-air-quality-control

The law came into force on January 1, 2025, and aims to terminate the sectoral agreement known as the ""Soy Moratorium,"" recognized as one of the most successful programs reconciling the development of large-scale agricultural production with environmental sustainability. This agreement regulates the granting of tax incentives and the allocation of public land to agribusiness companies with internal purchasing policies to avoid acquiring agricultural goods (soy, corn, cattle, etc.) produced in recently deforested areas. The plaintiffs argue that, regarding formal unconstitutionality, the matter falls under the exclusive initiative of the Executive Branch. As for material unconstitutionality, they claim that the law penalizes legal entities that adopt sustainable purchasing policies and favors suppliers that promote the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest, which would violate the principles of equality and free enterprise enshrined in the Federal Constitution. It was also emphasized that this law violates the protection of acquired rights, perfected legal acts, the defense of the environment as a fundamental principle of the national tax system, the right to an ecologically balanced environment, the duty to protect the environment, and the principle of prohibiting setbacks in environmental protection. It was highlighted that this law represents a setback in the fight against climate change, considering the commitments made under the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement, which hold supralegal status.
