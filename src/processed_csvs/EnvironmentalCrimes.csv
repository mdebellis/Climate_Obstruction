The Santo Antônio Hydroelectric Plant (UHE Santo Antônio) operates a large hydroelectric plant located in the Amazon region. Construction activities required the removal of vegetation along the banks of the Madeira River, for which subcontractors were hired. During the vegetation clearance, the Environmental Commission of the Rondônia State Legislative Assembly received complaints that the subcontractors were setting fires in areas of the Santo Antônio and Jirau Hydroelectric Plants. SEDAM issued an infraction notice, alleging that the subcontractors burned 2,280 hectares of vegetation (1,750 hectares belonging to Santo Antônio S.A.) and imposed a fine of R$10,000,000.00. In its claim, the plaintiff asserts that the fires in question were criminal and that it took all necessary preventive measures. It seeks recognition of the statute of limitations or, alternatively, the annulment of the administrative act on the grounds of defects and the absence of elements necessary to establish administrative liability. As an injunction, the company requests the suspension of the enforceability of the fine and an order for SEDAM to refrain from taking any action that would require payment of the fine. On the merits, it requests the annulment of the infraction notice, or alternatively, an adjustment to the applied penalty or reduction of the fine amount.",Whether the illegitimate emissions of CO2 on the illegal burning of forests can be considered to increase the amount of an administrative fine.,https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2023/20230923_84434_decision.pdf,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/santo-antonio-energia-sa-vs-sedam-administrative-fine-for-illegal-burning

The plaintiffs maintain that the public management of the defendant, as the head of the Ministry, was incompatible with the probity and decorum required of leaders in office. Among other decisions and omissions considered undignified, they allege the violation of international commitments ratified by the Brazilian government to combat climate change, in particular the Paris Agreement. They claim that the ministerial policy implemented by the defendant has not been proactive in achieving Brazil's targets for reducing Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). They affirm, in this sense, a lack of commitment to combating the illegal deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest. They also state that the budget of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) has been cut, compromising its environmental monitoring and enforcement activities. Finally, they request that the then-Minister of the Environment be recognized as having committed high crimes and misdemeanors (crime de responsabilidade) and that he be removed from office and disqualified from holding public office for eight years.","Whether the Minister of the Environment committed high crimes and misdemeanors (crime de responsabilidade) by failing to implement policy that proactively achieves Brazil's targets for reducing GHGs in violation of Brazil's international commitments to combat climate change, in particular the Paris Agreement.","https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2019/20190822_PET-n.-8351_petition.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2019/20191024_PET-n.-8351_decision.pdf, https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210820_PET-n.-8351_decision.pdf",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/fabiano-contarato-randolph-rodrigues-and-joenia-batista-v-ricardo-salles
